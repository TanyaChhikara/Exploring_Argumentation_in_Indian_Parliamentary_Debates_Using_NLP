First Nithari incident took place and thereafter  followed the Nirbhaya incident.  Sexual predators do not consider the age of  children and sexual crime against children of one to three years are also  committed.  I would like to congratulate the hon. Minister for introducing charges   in POCSO Act of 2012 and making provision of capital punishment therein.  This  Bill is certainly an important step to check the increasing incidents of sexual crime  against children.  I would like to congratulate the hon. Minister for setting up 1023  special fast track courts.  But safety of witnesses should also be taken care of.\",\n          \"The Government has made tall claims  through the hon. President and has mentioned about the initiatives taken during the  last years or are likely to be taken in future for development and prosperity.  The  Government keeps on reiterating about the Skill India Scheme but it is very  shocking that the youth are not getting employments as claimed.  Today the  situation has become so grave that even the posts of principals and teachers are  lying vacant in Kendriya Vidyalayas.  Whether it is Union Government or the State  Governments, they are promoting none else but contractors and thereby impeding  employment generation.  Money is being squeezed out of the farmers in the name  of the Fasal Bima Yoajana but farmers are not getting  their due amount under the  said scheme.  I would like to know about the Digital India whether any set-up has  ever been developed in order to make a village digitized despite the optic fibre laid   in Gram Panchayats.    Railway claims that all the unmanned level crossings have  been closed down but no under-bridge and over-bridge has been constructed in  Jind  during the last 15 years of the  regime of the Congress and the BJP.  If you  want to see the model of the electrification of hamlets, then you should visit Hisar.   The PMJAY is a very good scheme and in this regard I would like to suggest that  investment should be made therein to implement it properly.\",\n          \"I understand that 2 per cent surcharge on TDS  has no foundation and is anti-farmer.  I would urge upon the Government to do  away with this provision.  Surcharge on annual income between Rs.2 crore and  Rs.5 crore has been increased to 25 per cent and the tax has since gone up to 39 per  cent vis-a-vis 35.88 per cent in the previous year.  It is certainly going to result in  brain drain from this country.  With low rate of taxation, tax compliance is on the  higher side and vice versa.  By implication, in case of 42 per cent taxation, the  affluent ones would tend to avoid paying taxes by exhausting the loopholes  existing in the system.

We are concerned about those medical students who have come back from  Ukraine.  The attack on Ukraine by Russia is a disastrous step.  Nearly 3,000 civilians  have been killed or injured in this war.  The cost of direct damage to Ukraine\\u201fs  infrastructure amid Russia\\u201fs ongoing invasion has reached almost an estimated figure of  63 billion dollars.  We expected that the war would be stopped.  But it did not.  India\\u201fs  responsibility was aimed at evacuating the Indian citizens from Ukraine and it did so.  It  was a good step.  We can initiate dialogue to end the war.  \",\n          \"Unfortunately, for India, since  1947, we have focussed a lot on the Western front, but we have not spoken even a  little bit about the Eastern front.  The incidents which have been taking place in our  country are still taking place even after 1947 till date.  After independence in 1947  two more nations have been formed in this country.  What is the condition of  Hindus there.  The estimates shows that the Hindus which were 15 per cent earlier  has been reduced upto 0.72 per cent in one country and in the other it has been  reduced upto 7 per cent.  This is the reason for bringing this legislation.  In the year  1901, the population of Muslims in Assam was 12.4 per cent and this has been  increased upto 34.22 per cent in the year 2011.  This is a huge increase and this is  how democratic dividends are being sought.  It is nothing but vote bank politics  and appeasement which is going on in the country.  There is difference between  legal migration, illegal migration and migration due to economic policies.  If you  follow social media, you will find that how the infiltration is still going on and this  is actually harmful to the secular fabric of this country because attempt is to  constantly get focus away from western border and ISI and such activities are  involved in getting this migration done.  This is the reason by which these  activities are taking place from eastern border from Assam to Bangladesh.   That is  why demography is changing there.\",\n          \"The Supreme Court had pronounced the talaq- e-biddat as unconstitutional.  A number of other judgments delivered by the  various courts of our country are also there which have pronounced this practice as  unconstitutional.  But, there is not a single judgment where it has been said that the  Government should make the talaq-e-biddat a criminal offence. It clearly  demonstrates that the purpose of this Government is to demonize and penalize the  Muslim men.  The Government should have provided protection to the Muslim  women by bringing them under the ambit of the Domestic Violence Act, 2005.

First Nithari incident took place and thereafter  followed the Nirbhaya incident.  Sexual predators do not consider the age of  children and sexual crime against children of one to three years are also  committed.  I would like to congratulate the hon. Minister for introducing charges   in POCSO Act of 2012 and making provision of capital punishment therein.  This  Bill is certainly an important step to check the increasing incidents of sexual crime  against children.  I would like to congratulate the hon. Minister for setting up 1023  special fast track courts.  But safety of witnesses should also be taken care of.\",\n          \"The Government has made tall claims  through the hon. President and has mentioned about the initiatives taken during the  last years or are likely to be taken in future for development and prosperity.  The  Government keeps on reiterating about the Skill India Scheme but it is very  shocking that the youth are not getting employments as claimed.  Today the  situation has become so grave that even the posts of principals and teachers are  lying vacant in Kendriya Vidyalayas.  Whether it is Union Government or the State  Governments, they are promoting none else but contractors and thereby impeding  employment generation.  Money is being squeezed out of the farmers in the name  of the Fasal Bima Yoajana but farmers are not getting  their due amount under the  said scheme.  I would like to know about the Digital India whether any set-up has  ever been developed in order to make a village digitized despite the optic fibre laid   in Gram Panchayats.    Railway claims that all the unmanned level crossings have  been closed down but no under-bridge and over-bridge has been constructed in  Jind  during the last 15 years of the  regime of the Congress and the BJP.  If you  want to see the model of the electrification of hamlets, then you should visit Hisar.   The PMJAY is a very good scheme and in this regard I would like to suggest that  investment should be made therein to implement it properly.\",\n          \"I understand that 2 per cent surcharge on TDS  has no foundation and is anti-farmer.  I would urge upon the Government to do  away with this provision.  Surcharge on annual income between Rs.2 crore and  Rs.5 crore has been increased to 25 per cent and the tax has since gone up to 39 per  cent vis-a-vis 35.88 per cent in the previous year.  It is certainly going to result in  brain drain from this country.  With low rate of taxation, tax compliance is on the  higher side and vice versa.  By implication, in case of 42 per cent taxation, the  affluent ones would tend to avoid paying taxes by exhausting the loopholes  existing in the system.  Exemption of capital gains tax to the political parties and  on the income from voluntary contribution is a serious flaw.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 68,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Thursday, July 25, 2019\",\n          \"Thursday, March 31, 2022\",\n          \"Tuesday, February 6, 2024\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Oath\",\n          \"Union Budget\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Gender\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"F\",\n          \"M\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Party\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 42,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"KECM\",\n          \"Jharkhand Mukti Morcha\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Call For Action\",\n          \"Blame\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"original_speech\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1495,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The demand for such a Bill was being  made for long time in the country.

Sexual predators do not consider the age of  children and sexual crime against children of one to three years are also  committed.  I would like to congratulate the hon. Minister for introducing charges   in POCSO Act of 2012 and making provision of capital punishment therein.  This  Bill is certainly an important step to check the increasing incidents of sexual crime  against children.  I would like to congratulate the hon.

President and has mentioned about the initiatives taken during the  last years or are likely to be taken in future for development and prosperity.  The  Government keeps on reiterating about the Skill India Scheme but it is very  shocking that the youth are not getting employments as claimed.  Today the  situation has become so grave that even the posts of principals and teachers are  lying vacant in Kendriya Vidyalayas.  Whether it is Union Government or the State  Governments, they are promoting none else but contractors and thereby impeding  employment generation.  Money is being squeezed out of the farmers in the name  of the Fasal Bima Yoajana but farmers are not getting  their due amount under the  said scheme.  I would like to know about the Digital India whether any set-up has  ever been developed in order to make a village digitized despite the optic fibre laid   in Gram Panchayats.    Railway claims that all the unmanned level crossings have  been closed down but no under-bridge and over-bridge has been constructed in  Jind  during the last 15 years of the  regime of the Congress and the BJP.  If you  want to see the model of the electrification of hamlets, then you should visit Hisar.   The PMJAY is a very good scheme and in this regard I would like to suggest that  investment should be made therein to implement it properly.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def removeNumbers(data):\n","\treturn ''.join([i for i in data if not i.isdigit()])\n","\n","def toLowerCase(data):\n","\treturn data.lower()\n","\n","def removeWhiteSpace(data):\n","\treturn data.replace(\" \",\"\")\n","\n","def removeNewLine(data):\n","\treturn data.replace(\"\\n\",\"\")\n","\n","def getUpperCharacters(data):\n","\treturn ''.join(c for c in data if c.isupper())\n","\n","def removeSpecialCharacters(data):\n","\tdata = re.sub('[^a-zA-Z0-9 \\n\\.]', '', data)\n","\treturn data\n","\n","def removePunctuation(data):\n","    data = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s]', '', data)\n","    return data"],"metadata":{"id":"JD0GealOYcbL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712940433233,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"035_SAMYA JAIN","userId":"02712652874230304085"}}},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df['Preprocessed_Speech'] = df['Speech'].apply(toLowerCase)\n","df['Preprocessed_Speech'] = df['Preprocessed_Speech'].apply(removeSpecialCharacters)\n","df['Preprocessed_Speech'] = df['Preprocessed_Speech'].apply(removeNewLine)\n","df['Preprocessed_Speech'] = df['Preprocessed_Speech'].apply(removeNumbers)\n","df['Preprocessed_Speech'] = df['Preprocessed_Speech'].apply(removePunctuation)"],"metadata":{"id":"rRKCag295e03","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712940436001,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"035_SAMYA JAIN","userId":"02712652874230304085"}}},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":380},"id":"1OlhF5Ca6Qwe","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712940436463,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":14,"user":{"displayName":"035_SAMYA JAIN","userId":"02712652874230304085"}},"outputId":"79f043b9-2c4e-4f28-8b6f-b05768f20581"},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                          Speaker  \\\n","0  0            SHRI GAURAV GOGOI   \n","1  1     SHRI MADDILA GURUMOORTHY   \n","2  2          SHRI RAMPRIT MANDAL   \n","3  3  SHRI PRATAP CHANDRA SARANGI   \n","4  5            SHRI MALOOK NAGAR   \n","\n","                                              Speech  \\\n","0  This is a country characterised by devotion.

I would urge upon the Government to do  away with this provision.  Surcharge on annual income between Rs.2 crore and  Rs.5 crore has been increased to 25 per cent and the tax has since gone up to 39 per  cent vis-a-vis 35.88 per cent in the previous year.  It is certainly going to result in  brain drain from this country.  With low rate of taxation, tax compliance is on the  higher side and vice versa.  By implication, in case of 42 per cent taxation, the  affluent ones would tend to avoid paying taxes by exhausting the loopholes  existing in the system.

I would urge upon the Government to do  away with this provision.  Surcharge on annual income between Rs.2 crore and  Rs.5 crore has been increased to 25 per cent and the tax has since gone up to 39 per  cent vis-a-vis 35.88 per cent in the previous year.  It is certainly going to result in  brain drain from this country.  With low rate of taxation, tax compliance is on the  higher side and vice versa.  By implication, in case of 42 per cent taxation, the  affluent ones would tend to avoid paying taxes by exhausting the loopholes  existing in the system.

First Nithari incident took place and thereafter  followed the Nirbhaya incident.  Sexual predators do not consider the age of  children and sexual crime against children of one to three years are also  committed.  I would like to congratulate the hon. Minister for introducing charges   in POCSO Act of 2012 and making provision of capital punishment therein.  This  Bill is certainly an important step to check the increasing incidents of sexual crime  against children.  I would like to congratulate the hon. Minister for setting up 1023  special fast track courts.  But safety of witnesses should also be taken care of.\",\n          \"The Government has made tall claims  through the hon. President and has mentioned about the initiatives taken during the  last years or are likely to be taken in future for development and prosperity.  The  Government keeps on reiterating about the Skill India Scheme but it is very  shocking that the youth are not getting employments as claimed.  Today the  situation has become so grave that even the posts of principals and teachers are  lying vacant in Kendriya Vidyalayas.  Whether it is Union Government or the State  Governments, they are promoting none else but contractors and thereby impeding  employment generation.  Money is being squeezed out of the farmers in the name  of the Fasal Bima Yoajana but farmers are not getting  their due amount under the  said scheme.  I would like to know about the Digital India whether any set-up has  ever been developed in order to make a village digitized despite the optic fibre laid   in Gram Panchayats.    Railway claims that all the unmanned level crossings have  been closed down but no under-bridge and over-bridge has been constructed in  Jind  during the last 15 years of the  regime of the Congress and the BJP.  If you  want to see the model of the electrification of hamlets, then you should visit Hisar.   The PMJAY is a very good scheme and in this regard I would like to suggest that  investment should be made therein to implement it properly.\",\n          \"I understand that 2 per cent surcharge on TDS  has no foundation and is anti-farmer.  I would urge upon the Government to do  away with this provision.  Surcharge on annual income between Rs.2 crore and  Rs.5 crore has been increased to 25 per cent and the tax has since gone up to 39 per  cent vis-a-vis 35.88 per cent in the previous year.  It is certainly going to result in  brain drain from this country.  With low rate of taxation, tax compliance is on the  higher side and vice versa.  By implication, in case of 42 per cent taxation, the  affluent ones would tend to avoid paying taxes by exhausting the loopholes  existing in the system.  Exemption of capital gains tax to the political parties and  on the income from voluntary contribution is a serious flaw.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 68,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Thursday, July 25, 2019\",\n          \"Thursday, March 31, 2022\",\n          \"Tuesday, February 6, 2024\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Oath\",\n          \"Union Budget\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Gender\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"F\",\n          \"M\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Party\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 42,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"KECM\",\n          \"Jharkhand Mukti Morcha\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Call For Action\",\n          \"Blame\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"original_speech\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1495,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The demand for such a Bill was being  made for long time in the country.  First Nithari incident took place and thereafter  followed the Nirbhaya incident.  Sexual predators do not consider the age of  children and sexual crime against children of one to three years are also  committed.  I would like to congratulate the hon. Minister for introducing charges   in POCSO Act of 2012 and making provision of capital punishment therein.  This  Bill is certainly an important step to check the increasing incidents of sexual crime  against children.  I would like to congratulate the hon. Minister for setting up 1023  special fast track courts.  But safety of witnesses should also be taken care of.\",\n          \"The Government has made tall claims  through the hon. President and has mentioned about the initiatives taken during the  last years or are likely to be taken in future for development and prosperity.  The  Government keeps on reiterating about the Skill India Scheme but it is very  shocking that the youth are not getting employments as claimed.  Today the  situation has become so grave that even the posts of principals and teachers are  lying vacant in Kendriya Vidyalayas.  Whether it is Union Government or the State  Governments, they are promoting none else but contractors and thereby impeding  employment generation.  Money is being squeezed out of the farmers in the name  of the Fasal Bima Yoajana but farmers are not getting  their due amount under the  said scheme.  I would like to know about the Digital India whether any set-up has  ever been developed in order to make a village digitized despite the optic fibre laid   in Gram Panchayats.    Railway claims that all the unmanned level crossings have  been closed down but no under-bridge and over-bridge has been constructed in  Jind  during the last 15 years of the  regime of the Congress and the BJP.  If you  want to see the model of the electrification of hamlets, then you should visit Hisar.   The PMJAY is a very good scheme and in this regard I would like to suggest that  investment should be made therein to implement it properly.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

I would urge upon the Government to do  away with this provision.  Surcharge on annual income between Rs.2 crore and  Rs.5 crore has been increased to 25 per cent and the tax has since gone up to 39 per  cent vis-a-vis 35.88 per cent in the previous year.  It is certainly going to result in  brain drain from this country.  With low rate of taxation, tax compliance is on the  higher side and vice versa.  By implication, in case of 42 per cent taxation, the  affluent ones would tend to avoid paying taxes by exhausting the loopholes  existing in the system.

Another report came regarding the Ayushman  Bharat scheme as to what kind of corruption is happening in Ayushman Bharat  today. The audit noted that around 7.5 lakh beneficiaries were registered against the  same mobile number and no verification was done. Claims are being filed in the  name of 90 thousand people who have died. No action is being taken on that. Today  ED has become another arm of BJP. ED's job is to catch the corrupt. But today ED  is their special weapon to suppress democracy and the voice of opposition and how  to include corrupt people in the BJP. Had they allowed ED to work, it would have  caught all the people who have absconded abroad today. There are about 31 people  abroad who owe a debt of Rs 40 thousand crore, but today ED is not  apprehending them. If the Prime Minister is so powerful in the world then why does  he not bring back these people hiding abroad?\n","\n","Positive Statement:\n","This is a country characterised by devotion. This  country is a country of faith. In this country, we bind our diversity with goodwill  and cherish the society with a sense of service. Lord Rama belongs to everyone and  he is with us all the time. When we meet each other, we exchange greetings by saying  'Ram-Ram' in North India or Western India. What is Mahatma Gandhi's definition  of Ram Rajya? Where everyone is happy and no one is sad, this is his definition.  Gandhi ji has also said that his Hindu dharma teaches him to respect all religions,  the secret of Ram Rajya is inherent in this definition. We should ponder whether all  the backward, deprived and minorities are happy, this was the definition of Ram  Rajya by Mahatma Gandhi. But today we are seeing that crimes against Scheduled  Castes and Scheduled Tribes are on the rise. If we compare it with the year gone by,  crime has gone up by around 50 percent in the year 2023. Is this Ram Rajya? Today  the backward classes are demanding a caste census because they see that injustice is  being meted out to them, and caste discrimination is taking place. Sita Mata has also  been referred to in the Ramayana. Sita Mata never let her patience and strength  diminish, but did the Dalit daughter of Unnao, our women wrestlers, have the same  feeling when they were fighting for their rights? It is mentioned in the report of our  own Parliamentary Committee that women belonging to the Scheduled Castes are  being harassed on the basis of caste and gender and they are also sexually exploited.  After this discussion in the Lok Sabha, when all the MPs go to their respective  constituencies, they will see helplessness among the youth. Today, due to this  unemployment, the helpless Indian youth has chosen the path of drugs and crime.  Today, they helplessly arrange some funds and migrate to a foreign country. This is  the reality. We cannot deny this truth. That is why our party has been doing social  service for so many years. We are aware of the truth. We have done a lot, but still a  lot remains to be done. We too have no objection in admitting that we have made  mistakes. Whereas the Congress follows Gandhi's Ram Rajya, we walk on the path  of justice. We believe in secularism. People living in India believe in different  religions and we believe in equality of all religions. Not just scripture, but there is  so much strength in the soil of this country that binds the different languages and  faiths of 140 crore people with integrity, love and goodwill. Therefore, I would also  like to caution the ruling party that it should desist from following the path of  Nathuram. They should not allow the tradition of glorifying Nathuram either. You  should not have any hesitation in this. I would like to say that one must refrain from  exhibiting ego in one’s conduct. Ravana was killed due to his ego. It is the egoistic  approach of the government that keeps it from casting a look on rising inflation and  instability  in the country, whether it is in Manipur, Ladakh or along the border with  China. Your ego prevents you from perceiving the growing apprehension that exists  in society today, particularly among minorities. This country did not come into  existence when this Government came to Power in the year 2014, this country did  not emerge on earth on January 22, 2024. Ram Lalla was always with us. He was  with us even 500 years ago and is with us even today and when your Government is  not in Power he will be with us tomorrow also. Ram is in our hearts. There should  be love and goodwill in saying Jai Shri Ram. But bitterness and anger are always  heard in your Jai Shri Ram, why is it so? The Indian National Congress Party has  always worked to confer rights on the citizens of India in a spirit of service, inspired  by the values of Gandhiji and the guidance of Dr. Ambedkar. We also expect you to  work in a spirit of service in whatever time is left in your tenure. Let me remind you  once again that in our country there are many religions, many scriptures, many  prophets, but if there is any scripture of governance, it is only the Constitution.  THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CONSUMER  AFFAIRS, FOOD AND PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION AND MINISTER OF  STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI  NIRANJAN JYOTI): I being associated with the Ram Janmabhoomi movement,  support this motion in this new House and compliment the illustrious Prime Minister  of the country on behalf of the saints and the people of the country. This was a  struggle of 500 years. Although the name of any person from outside cannot be  mentioned here, today when I stand to speak on this motion, I would like to recall  the respected late Ashok Singhal Ji. The saints who never knew how to live under  roofs, who used to live in forests, under the trees, they all gathered in the Kumbh of  Prayagraj for the Ram Janmabhoomi on the request of Ashok Singhal ji. Now there  was a lot of discussion from the opposition side. They talked about Bapuji. After  independence, Mahatma Gandhi had also said that since independence had been  achieved, Congress should be abolished. This was not accepted. But if anyone has  truly implemented the idea of Ram Rajya, it has been implemented by the illustrious  Prime Minister of the country. The people of the country are watching what the  opposition did to Ram. Earlier in the year 2019, their counsel had appeared in court  and submitted that a Judgment should not be passed in favour of the construction of  the Ram temple. I respect the judges and congratulate the Hon.Prime Minister of the  country. We have to change history now by reading the Ramcharit Manas and follow  the path of Lord Ram. Hon. Prime Minister has added recognition to the poor in the  society following the footsteps of Maryada Purushottam and houses have been  allotted to 4 crore poor people. I was overwhelmed with emotion to see Lord Shri  Ram being consecrated in the Grand temple at Ayodhya by the Illustrious Prime  Minister of the country. The Hon. Prime Minister like Lord Ram has expressed  concern for the poor and the backward.\n","\n","Neutral Statement:\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"I salute Hon.
