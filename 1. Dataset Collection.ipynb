I immediately said, &#147;Let us discuss\\r\\n  the matter.&#148; We met at 10.30 a.m. in my Chamber. He was kind enough to meet me in my\\r\\n  Chamber and explained the whole position to me.<o:p> </o:p> </span></font></p>\\r\\n  <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 100%\" align=\"justify\"><font size=\"3\"\\r\\n  face=\"Times New Roman\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\r\\n  </span><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt\">The position regarding the presentation of\\r\\n  the Report and the Minutes of the Report is really confusing. The Minutes have not been\\r\\n  circulated so far. I must say that the Chairman came to me and explained the procedure to\\r\\n  me. I just wanted to know the procedure. Therefore, after my discussions with him, I\\r\\n  called another Member of the Committee, Shri Kirit Somaiya, and he also told me as to what\\r\\n  the matter is. <o:p> </o:p> </span></font></p>\\r\\n  <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 100%\" align=\"justify\"><font size=\"3\"\\r\\n  face=\"Times New Roman\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\r\\n  </span><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt\">About two days back, Shri Kirit Somaiya\\r\\n  told me that the Members have not given their consent to this Report. I said, &#147;Your\\r\\n  saying is not enough, and that the Members have to write to me.&#148; Thereafter, seven\\r\\n  Members have written to me saying that they did not agree with this during the meeting.<span\\r\\n  style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&nbsp; </span>I am not going into the facts as to whether what\\r\\n  the Chairman is saying is correct or what the Members are saying is correct because that\\r\\n  is very difficult to decide.<o:p> </o:p> </span></font></p>\\r\\n  <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 36.0pt; line-height: 100%\" align=\"justify\"><span\\r\\n  style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">One Member had\\r\\n  written a letter to me mentioning the names of others. I said that I must get letters from\\r\\n  all the Members. Now, I am in possession of the letters from the seven Members. <o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>\\r\\n  <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 100%\" align=\"justify\"><font size=\"3\"\\r\\n  face=\"Times New Roman\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\r\\n  </span><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt\">The House will agree with me that this\\r\\n  matter has become serious. I would now reply to Shri Pawan Kumar Bansal&#146;s point of\\r\\n  order that in a normal case, the Members do not speak in the House, when any issue\\r\\n  concerning the Committee is raised. But when the procedural issue comes before me, I have\\r\\n  to permit the Members and I have to understand what the Members have to say. Therefore,\\r\\n  three Members of the Committee were allowed to speak. Unfortunately, two Members who spoke\\r\\n  were not present in the final stage of the meeting of the Committee. Therefore, I went\\r\\n  through some documents. The question of procedure, of course, exists. Therefore, I had to\\r\\n  hear the Members of the Committee. I had also suggested to the hon. Chairman that he could\\r\\n  take another meeting and he could resolve the issue because as far as possible, for the\\r\\n  general convenience of the House, I would say that such issues are to be settled in the\\r\\n  Committee itself. <o:p> </o:p> </span></font></p>\\r\\n  <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 36.0pt; line-height: 100%\" align=\"justify\"><span\\r\\n  style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">It is very\\r\\n  unfortunate that the Members of the Committee are saying one thing and the Chairman is\\r\\n  saying something else. In future, I would advise the Chairman to see that the issues are\\r\\n  settled, as far as possible, in the Committee itself. It looks to me, sometimes, there is\\r\\n  a gap of communication and, sometimes, there is a misunderstanding. I will have to go\\r\\n  through the Minutes in respect of para 4, which Shri Mani Shankar Aiyar had referred to. I\\r\\n  have to go through the Minutes, I have to see all the rules, and I have to see the\\r\\n  previous precedents relating to this particular case.<o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>\\r\\n  <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 100%\" align=\"justify\"><font size=\"3\"\\r\\n  face=\"Times New Roman\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\r\\n  </span><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt\">I would be able to make up my mind about\\r\\n  this only after going through all this.

Erosion has also been reported at places in Nadia district and also\\r\\n  along the banks of other rivers. As regards the problem of erosion, the Planning\\r\\n  Commission, in 1996, had constituted an Expert Committee which had suggested various\\r\\n  short-term and long-term measures to be taken up by the State Government as well as the\\r\\n  Farakka Barrage Project Authority.

It is for them to take measures to\\r\\n  control the floods. The Central Government does provide funds but they are not accounted\\r\\n  for. So far as flood management is concerned, a Centrally-Sponsored Scheme for taking up\\r\\n  critical flood control and anti-erosion schemes in Brahmaputra and Barak Valley with an\\r\\n  outlay of Rs.166.68 crore has been taken up by the Central Government. The Central\\r\\n  Government are taking whatever steps are possible and the ultimate results lie in the\\r\\n  hands of the State Government who have to implement the schemes and to appropriately\\r\\n  utilise the funds which are being provided for flood control and other measures. S.P.\\r\\n  Gupta Committee&#146;s report is under the consideration of the Government. The measures\\r\\n  that have been taken by the Central Government are adequate to meet the situation.

The most\\r\\n  neglected part in the unorganized sector is agriculture sector. 55.1 million people are\\r\\n  working in the agriculture sector in different places. Many of them are working in the\\r\\n  agricultural sector and a very few are working in the non-agricultural sector in the rural\\r\\n  areas. Those who are working in the agricultural sector, get a mere pittance as daily\\r\\n  wages. Sowing and ploughing are two different matters to be taken up in the agricultural\\r\\n  sector. So far as ploughing is concerned, in many of the States, wages given are good but\\r\\n  so far as sowing is concerned wages are very limited. It is the duty of the State\\r\\n  Governments to ensure that whosoever goes for the work, whether for ploughing or sowing,\\r\\n  should get the same wages.

The\\r\\n  unfortunate situation is that the funds allocated for irrigation in the Five Year Plans is\\r\\n  decreasing every year. The funds utilized for genetic engineering and genetic technology\\r\\n  are not sufficient. Regarding loans, 70 percent agriculture based population is provided\\r\\n  Rs. 80,000 crore, whereas the remaining 20-25 per cent people are provided Rs. 7 to 8 lakh\\r\\n  crores and there is a need to remove this imbalance. Public Sector and Private Sector\\r\\n  Banks have been instructed to advance 40 per cent and 18 per cent loan for agriculture in\\r\\n  the villages and on agriculture respectively which the banks have not followed and this is\\r\\n  the direction of the Government. The cultivators are in trouble these days. The first\\r\\n  thing we shall have to do is to provide remunerative prices to their produce. They will be\\r\\n  in trouble if they do not get it. The consumer should be able to get the foodgrains at\\r\\n  cheaper rates. The farmers do not get the price for the sugar they produce and textile\\r\\n  industry and oil industry is thrown out of gear. Agro-based industry has not been\\r\\n  developed. Condition of the common man is pitiable in the sense that he works round the\\r\\n  clock and continues to starve. There is no medical and educational facility for their\\r\\n  children. By curtailing rate of interest by 1 to 1.5 per cent the Government cannot add\\r\\n  coffers to its treasury.

I am of the opinion that the\\r\\n  money provided by the Government should be used properly.</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Dairy and Food Processing is a\\r\\n  field where there is no saturation point. We can create a massive infrastructure by\\r\\n  investing more and more funds in this sector which will give a new direction to our youths\\r\\n  apart from generating employment for them. We should establish agriculture based\\r\\n  industries in the villages itself so that employment is generated there. We have a large\\r\\n  resource of energy, therefore, the Government should make proper management to exploit\\r\\n  energy for the development of villages. If we make proper management of marketing in\\r\\n  health, education, agricultural goods, then it will definitely enhance the purchasing\\r\\n  power of villagers which will ultimately lead the nation towards prosperity and increase\\r\\n  our GDP.</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"><b>SHRI RAMDAS ATHAWALE</b>: We\\r\\n  are discussing an important issue which pertains to plight of farmers, youths and working\\r\\n  class. This is not important as to how much we have succeeded in uplifting our poor\\r\\n  masses, but the fact is that 26 percent of our population is still living below the\\r\\n  poverty line. It is, therefore, necessary for all of us to bring an overall change in the\\r\\n  entire system. There is an urgent need to provide justice to the labourers and the\\r\\n  farmers. The landless people should be given land. If the Government fail to provide\\r\\n  employment to the unemployed, then they should have been given unemployment allowance at\\r\\n  the rate of Rs.3000 p.m. There is also a need to formulate a law for providing facilities\\r\\n  at regional level under Insurance Scheme. If we are really serious in eliminating\\r\\n  unemployment then we will also have to decrease the duty hours from 8 to 6. </font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">There is also need to do away\\r\\n  with contract system. I request that the Government should regularise all those workers,\\r\\n  who have worked for two years. Our hon. Prime Minister has also talked about providing\\r\\n  reservation in private sectors. At the end of this 13<sup>th</sup> Lok Sabha I only wish\\r\\n  that justice will be meted out to our poor, dalits and tribal people and they will walk\\r\\n  shoulder to shoulder with other people in socio-economic field.</font></p>\\r\\n  <b><p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE\\r\\n  AND MINISTER OF FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES (SHRI RAJNATH SINGH) </b>replying to the\\r\\n  discussion, said <b>:</b> The development of the country will not be possible until and\\r\\n  unless the agriculture sector is developed. The major producer, customer and consumer in\\r\\n  the country is the farmer. Whether there is any Government, its intention towards the\\r\\n  farmer, the poor and the workers should be clear. During the first Five Year Plan maximum\\r\\n  allocation was for the development of the agriculture sector. After the First Five Year\\r\\n  Plan the allocation for the rural sector has been continuously declining. At present only\\r\\n  40 per cent land is irrigated and 60 per cent land is fully rain fed. Soon after our\\r\\n  Government came to power we started paying attention towards small irrigation projects.\\r\\n  Regarding allocation for irrigation, sufficient funds have been allocated for our\\r\\n  accelerated irrigation schemes. The ground water level has been continuously falling down\\r\\n  due to the use of chemical fertilizers and chemical pesticides. Our Government during the\\r\\n  last five years expressed its concern towards bio-fertilizers and organic farming etc. We\\r\\n  have set up around 182 such bio-fertilizer units, which have the capacity to produce\\r\\n  18,000 metric tonnes of bio-fertilizers. We want to promote the use of bio-fertilizers\\r\\n  during the Tenth Five Year Plan. We are giving various incentives for organic farming. The\\r\\n  work on the genetically modified seeds is going on. The loan disbursed to the farmers\\r\\n  during the last five years has never ever been distributed in the history of free India.\\r\\n  Today the farmers are not to pay 14 to 18 percent interest on loans but the maximum\\r\\n  interest rate, they are supposed to pay is only 9 per cent. We want to go for competitive\\r\\n  marketing for the farmers. The Government had set up the new power project of 18,000 MW\\r\\n  generation capacity. It has started power generation. Other power projects also are being\\r\\n  set up. The personal capital investment capacity of the farmer should increase. Therefore,\\r\\n  the first time in the history of free India the rate of interest has been lowered down. On\\r\\n  31<sup>st</sup> January, the Hon. Prime Minister has inaugurated the Kissan Call Centers\\r\\n  to make available the agriculture related information to the farmers. We have taken up the\\r\\n  river linkage project to make use of the flood waters for irrigation purposes. The farmers\\r\\n  should get the remunerative prices for their crops, the Government is making efforts in\\r\\n  this direction and we have taken effective steps to strengthen the marketing system also.\\r\\n  It is improper to say that the per capita consumption of foodgrain has reduced, since\\r\\n  during 1950-51 the per capita and per annum foodgrain consumption was 154.1 Kg. which has\\r\\n  gone up to 179.3 Kg. It has been said that India has succumbed under the pressure of WTO\\r\\n  but we have not compromised with the interest of our farmers. Our imports are continuously\\r\\n  decreasing whereas exports are increasing. I can say with conviction that public\\r\\n  investment in agriculture has increased tremendously in our regime. </font></p>\\r\\n  <b><p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">THE MINISTER OF LABOUR(DR.\\r\\n  SAHIB SINGH VERMA) </b>also replying to the discussion, said : During the last five years,\\r\\n  ameliorating the lot of the people engaged in unorganised sector has been the greatest\\r\\n  concern of the Government. During this period, the incidence of retrenchment and lockouts\\r\\n  has come down. Before this Government came into office, 2.5 lakh industries were closed\\r\\n  down. The Government has made every effort to prevent closure of industries and have taken\\r\\n  care of the interests of the workers besides making investment. Earlier, the Indian Labour\\r\\n  Conference used to be organised for a single day but now, it is organised for three days\\r\\n  to facilitate comprehensive discussion on various issues. The condition of ESI hospitals\\r\\n  was deplorable and during the tenure of the Government 16 new model hospitals were set up\\r\\n  and facilities were upgraded. On this exercise, a sum of rupees 300 crore was spent. The\\r\\n  Government has made arrangements for expeditious settlement of claims of the workers. For\\r\\n  the last few years, the Government has made arrangements for payment of 9.5 per cent rate\\r\\n  of interest on the provident fund deposits. The Government has gone in for business\\r\\n  process re-engineering so that the claims could be settled within 30 days instead of 6-8\\r\\n  months.</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Eight per cent growth rate is\\r\\n  achieved only when the people work and jobs get created. The Government has improved the\\r\\n  training facilities for the workers and has also increased the allocation for education of\\r\\n  their children. Moreover, the mandatory maternity payment of Rs.500 has been revised.\\r\\n  During this period each year, 20 thousand houses were constructed for the Beedi workers.\\r\\n  Employees do enjoy the right to strike work. Even today, all the workers who come within\\r\\n  the purview of Industrial Disputes Act do enjoy the right to strike work and have not been\\r\\n  in any way affected by the verdict of the Supreme Court. Investment in the country has\\r\\n  gone up and the Government has upgraded the training facilities for the millions of under\\r\\n  employed and unemployed youth of the country besides giving them concessions. The country\\r\\n  has witnessed a spurt in industrial activities.</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Child Labour in the past was on\\r\\n  the rise, but now its number is coming down. The hon. Prime Minister in the Tenth Five\\r\\n  Year Plan has increased the allocation for child labour from Rs.249 crore to Rs.602 crore.\\r\\n  Earlier, the schemes for child labour were in vogue in one hundred districts, but now\\r\\n  these are being extended to 250 districts. It is the vision of the hon. Prime Minister\\r\\n  that by the year 2007, child labour should be totally eradicated from the country. For\\r\\n  this, the Government has introduced a number of schemes and is also imparting education to\\r\\n  all. From this point of view, thousands of schools are functioning and NGOs have been\\r\\n  associated in this exercise. </font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">The Government has given social\\r\\n  security cover to the people engaged in unorganised sector. A pilot scheme has already\\r\\n  been started in 50 districts. Most of the people engaged in unorganised sector live in\\r\\n  unauthorised colonies. For them, the Cabinet has taken a decision that their houses will\\r\\n  not be demolished, but in future no unauthorised construction will be allowed. </font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Earlier, the minimum wages\\r\\n  national floor level was Rs.35 and the Government has directed all the States to formulate\\r\\n  laws for the agricultural workers in their respective States. However, unfortunately\\r\\n  Kerala is the only State to have enacted a law in this regard. All the agricultural\\r\\n  workers, cobblers, washermen and poor etc. have been included in the category of\\r\\n  unorganised sector and given social security cover. The Government will endeavour to\\r\\n  introduce right to work and right to duty on coming into power again. </font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">The Government is concerned about\\r\\n  the welfare of the people emigrating to other countries in search of employment. For such\\r\\n  people an Insurance Scheme has been started from the 25<sup>th</sup> of December. Next\\r\\n  year, on being voted back to power, the Government will provide social security cover to\\r\\n  37 crore workers of the country and will also help the poor. The Government has tried to\\r\\n  realise the <i>Antyodaya</i> dream of hon. Deendayal Upadhya. The entire working class of\\r\\n  the country is totally gaga over this. They will vote back to power Shri Atal Bihari\\r\\n  Vajpayee so that their dreams could be realised. </font></p>\\r\\n  <b><p ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Discussion concluded</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">VALEDICTORY REFERENCE</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">MR. SPEAKER:</b> Hon. Members, we\\r\\n  have now come to the close of the second part of the 14<sup>th</sup> Session which\\r\\n  commenced on the 29<sup>th</sup> January, 2004. As the hon. Members are aware, it was\\r\\n  convened specially to transact essential financial business before the dissolution of the\\r\\n  13<sup>th</sup> Lok Sabha. On this last working day of the 13<sup>th</sup> Lok Sabha, I\\r\\n  would like to take this opportunity not only to make a mention of the business transacted\\r\\n  during the second part of the 14<sup>th</sup> Session, but also to recapitulate some of\\r\\n  the important events that took place during the 13<sup>th</sup> Lok Sabha.</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">In this short second part of the\\r\\n  14<sup>th</sup> Session, spread over five sittings, <i>inter-alia</i> the Interim Railway\\r\\n  and General Budgets for the year 2004-2005, Supplementary Demands for Grants (Railways)\\r\\n  and (General) for the year 2003-2004, the Demand for Excess Grant (Railways) for the year\\r\\n  2001-2002 as well as connected Appropriation Bills and the Finance Bill were passed by the\\r\\n  House.</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">As in the past, the Lok Sabha\\r\\n  Secretariat will be bringing out, in due course, a Souvenir containing a detailed account\\r\\n  of the business transacted by the House and the work done by the Parliamentary Committees\\r\\n  during the life of the 13<sup>th</sup> Lok Sabha. However, I may now touch upon some of\\r\\n  the salient features and significant events of the 13<sup>th</sup> Lok Sabha.</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">The present Lok Sabha was\\r\\n  constituted on the 10<sup>th</sup> October, 1999 and the House met for the first time on\\r\\n  the 20<sup>th</sup> October, 1999. In all, the House had 356 sittings spread over 1,944\\r\\n  hours.</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">We celebrated the 50<sup>th</sup>\\r\\n  Anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of India as well as the 50<sup>th</sup>\\r\\n  Anniversary of the Indian Republic on the 26<sup>th</sup> November, 1999 and the 27<sup>th</sup>\\r\\n  January, 2000, respectively. The Golden Jubilee of the Parliament of India was also\\r\\n  celebrated during the tenure of the 13<sup>th</sup> Lok Sabha. As you know, the two Houses\\r\\n  had met for the first time, after the First General Elections, on the 13<sup>th</sup> May,\\r\\n  1952. To mark the occasion, an International Parliamentary Conference was hosted by us\\r\\n  from the 22<sup>nd</sup> to the 26<sup>th</sup> January, 2003.</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">For the first time, on the 16<sup>th</sup>\\r\\n  May, 2000, my worthy predecessor, Shri G.M.C. Balayogi, constituted a 15-Member Ethics\\r\\n  Committee of the House. This was clearly a reflection of our collective concern for\\r\\n  probity in public life.</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Some of the important <i>ad hoc </i>Committees\\r\\n  constituted during the Lok Sabha were the Joint Parliamentary Committees on &#145;Stock\\r\\n  Market Scam and matters relating thereto&#146;, &#145;Security in Parliament House\\r\\n  Complex&#146;, and &#145;Pesticide residues in and safety standards for soft drinks, fruit\\r\\n  juice and other beverages&#146;. All the Parliamentary Standing Committees and the <i>ad\\r\\n  hoc </i>Committees functioned very well during the Thirteenth Lok Sabha and presented 839\\r\\n  Reports containing important recommendations.</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">During the course of the 14\\r\\n  sessions that we have had, the House passed 305 Bills. Of these, 14 were Constitution\\r\\n  (Amendment) Bills, which include: the Constitution Amendment Bill making the right to\\r\\n  education as a Fundamental Right and laying down that &#145;the State shall provide free\\r\\n  and compulsory education to all children of the age group of six to fourteen years in such\\r\\n  manner as the State may, by law, determine&#146;; the Constitution Amendment Bill\\r\\n  restricting the size of the Council of Ministers and amending the Anti-Defection law by\\r\\n  omitting the provisions relating to splits; and the Constitution Amendment Bill including\\r\\n  four more languages in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution.</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Among other important Bills\\r\\n  passed during the tenure of the Thirteenth Lok Sabha were the three Bills of the year\\r\\n  2000, which paved the way for creation of the new States of Chhattisgarh, Uttaranchal and\\r\\n  Jharkhand.</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">The Joint Sitting of Parliament\\r\\n  summoned by the President of India under the provisions of article 108(1) of the\\r\\n  Constitution on 26th March, 2002, for the purpose of deliberating and voting on the\\r\\n  Prevention of Terrorism Bill, 2002 was an event of parliamentary importance. It was the\\r\\n  third such occasion when a joint sitting of the Houses was summoned, the earlier two being\\r\\n  in connection with the Dowry Prohibition Bill, 1959 and the Banking Service Commission\\r\\n  (Repeal) Bill, 1977.</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">While there have been events and\\r\\n  occasions concerning the House in the last four years and nearly four months which are\\r\\n  worthy of being proudly taken note of by the posterity, we have also had our share of\\r\\n  moments of concern, sadness and grief.</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">It is with a heavy heart that I\\r\\n  recall the tragic and untimely demise of my illustrious predecessor, Shri G.M.C. Balayogi.\\r\\n  As Speaker, he endeavoured to uphold the dignity and prestige of the Parliament. On behalf\\r\\n  of the entire House, I once again pay respectful homage to this leader of eminence.</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">The dastardly attack on our\\r\\n  Parliament by terrorists on 13th December, 2001 was a reminder of the threats to our\\r\\n  democratic institutions and way of life. This violent and senseless attempt was thwarted\\r\\n  by the prompt and courageous response of the security personnel. The sacrifices made by\\r\\n  the brave souls in protecting our supreme legislative institution will remain etched in\\r\\n  our memories forever.</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">The new Parliament Library\\r\\n  Building was inaugurated by the then hon. President, Shri K.R. Narayanan on 7th May, 2002.\\r\\n  The fully computerised Library, with its modern facilities, will help the Members not only\\r\\n  in discharging their parliamentary duties more effectively but also in their intellectual\\r\\n  pursuits.</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">As you are aware, the plans to\\r\\n  augment and improve the infrastructure of the Constitution Club for the benefit of the\\r\\n  Members have also finally fructified. The foundation stone for undertaking the work of\\r\\n  renovating and remodelling the Club facilities was laid by the hon. Vice-President of\\r\\n  India, Shri Bhairon Singh Shekhawat yesterday, the 4th February, 2004.</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">The very good performance of the\\r\\n  Thirteenth Lok Sabha, in discharging its multifarious role in the fields of Legislation\\r\\n  and Finance as well as in transaction of other business of national importance, has been\\r\\n  made possible because of the valuable contributions made by the Leader of the House, the\\r\\n  Deputy Prime Minister and other Members of the Council of Ministers, the Leader of the\\r\\n  Opposition, the Leaders, Deputy Leaders and Whips of the political Parties, Chairmen of\\r\\n  Parliamentary Committees and indeed each and every Member of this House. </font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">I gratefully acknowledge the\\r\\n  unstinted cooperation and support extended to me by all sections of the House, the\\r\\n  Treasury as well as the Opposition Benches, in discharging my duties as the Presiding\\r\\n  Officer of this House.</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">I am thankful to the hon. Deputy\\r\\n  Speaker and Member on the Panel of Chairmen who have very ably shared the responsibility\\r\\n  of presiding over the House.</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">I, on behalf of the entire House,\\r\\n  express my thanks to the Secretary-General and officers and staff of the Lok Sabha\\r\\n  Secretariat who have worked hard behind the scene to help us perform the duties bestowed\\r\\n  on us as representatives of the people of India.</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">I also appreciate the services of\\r\\n  the Watch &amp; Ward Staff, CRPF, Delhi Police and other security agencies who are\\r\\n  vigilantly protecting the Parliament House Complex. I also thank the CPWD and other allied\\r\\n  agencies which have rendered their valuable support.</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">The media persons have taken the\\r\\n  work done by us to the people and have helped us in enhancing our parliamentary\\r\\n  performance.</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">We extend our sincere thanks to\\r\\n  them and hope that we will continue to have such cooperation in future too.</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Very soon, we would be going back\\r\\n  to the people to seek their renewed mandate. Let us hope to meet again in the new House as\\r\\n  well.</font></p>\\r\\n  <p ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">With the conclusion of the\\r\\n  Thirteenth Lok Sabha, we take a step towards crossing another significant milestone in the\\r\\n  history of our parliamentary democracy.
