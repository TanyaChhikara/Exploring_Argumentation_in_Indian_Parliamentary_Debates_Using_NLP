1,SHRI GAURAV GOGOI,"This is a country characterised by devotion. This  country is a country of faith. In this country, we bind our diversity with goodwill  and cherish the society with a sense of service. Lord Rama belongs to everyone and  he is with us all the time. When we meet each other, we exchange greetings by saying  'Ram-Ram' in North India or Western India. What is Mahatma Gandhi's definition  of Ram Rajya? Where everyone is happy and no one is sad, this is his definition.  Gandhi ji has also said that his Hindu dharma teaches him to respect all religions,  the secret of Ram Rajya is inherent in this definition. We should ponder whether all  the backward, deprived and minorities are happy, this was the definition of Ram  Rajya by Mahatma Gandhi. But today we are seeing that crimes against Scheduled  Castes and Scheduled Tribes are on the rise. If we compare it with the year gone by,  crime has gone up by around 50 percent in the year 2023. Is this Ram Rajya? Today  the backward classes are demanding a caste census because they see that injustice is  being meted out to them, and caste discrimination is taking place. Sita Mata has also  been referred to in the Ramayana. Sita Mata never let her patience and strength  diminish, but did the Dalit daughter of Unnao, our women wrestlers, have the same  feeling when they were fighting for their rights? It is mentioned in the report of our  own Parliamentary Committee that women belonging to the Scheduled Castes are  being harassed on the basis of caste and gender and they are also sexually exploited.  After this discussion in the Lok Sabha, when all the MPs go to their respective  constituencies, they will see helplessness among the youth. Today, due to this  unemployment, the helpless Indian youth has chosen the path of drugs and crime.  Today, they helplessly arrange some funds and migrate to a foreign country. This is  the reality. We cannot deny this truth. That is why our party has been doing social  service for so many years. We are aware of the truth. We have done a lot, but still a  lot remains to be done. We too have no objection in admitting that we have made  mistakes. Whereas the Congress follows Gandhi's Ram Rajya, we walk on the path  of justice. We believe in secularism. People living in India believe in different  religions and we believe in equality of all religions. Not just scripture, but there is  so much strength in the soil of this country that binds the different languages and  faiths of 140 crore people with integrity, love and goodwill. Therefore, I would also  like to caution the ruling party that it should desist from following the path of  Nathuram. They should not allow the tradition of glorifying Nathuram either. You  should not have any hesitation in this. I would like to say that one must refrain from  exhibiting ego in one’s conduct. Ravana was killed due to his ego. It is the egoistic  approach of the government that keeps it from casting a look on rising inflation and  instability  in the country, whether it is in Manipur, Ladakh or along the border with  China. Your ego prevents you from perceiving the growing apprehension that exists  in society today, particularly among minorities. This country did not come into  existence when this Government came to Power in the year 2014, this country did  not emerge on earth on January 22, 2024. Ram Lalla was always with us. He was  with us even 500 years ago and is with us even today and when your Government is  not in Power he will be with us tomorrow also. Ram is in our hearts. There should  be love and goodwill in saying Jai Shri Ram. But bitterness and anger are always  heard in your Jai Shri Ram, why is it so? The Indian National Congress Party has  always worked to confer rights on the citizens of India in a spirit of service, inspired  by the values of Gandhiji and the guidance of Dr. Ambedkar. We also expect you to  work in a spirit of service in whatever time is left in your tenure. Let me remind you  once again that in our country there are many religions, many scriptures, many  prophets, but if there is any scripture of governance, it is only the Constitution.

2,SHRI MADDILA GURUMOORTHY,"I would like to speak about Lord  Rama and the importance of the eternal teachings of Lord Rama. As depicted in the  Ramayana, his reign, termed as 'Ram Rajya' symbolized good governance, and  epitomised justice, welfare and happiness for all. The leadership of Lord Rama was  dedicated to fairness, compassion, and the welfare of his people above all else. The  Lord Venkateshwara Temple in my parliamentary constituency at Tirupati is one of  the most famous temples in our country. Anjanadri Hill, one of the seven Hills, is  supposed to be the birthplace of Hanuman. Another location Lepakshi is referenced  in the Ramaana which stands as a testament to the widespread reverence of Lord  Rama’s legacy.  By developing these sites, we will enhance India’s cultural heritage  tourism as well as reinforce the bonds of unity and spirituality inspired by Lord  Rama. We request the Government for comprehensive development and better  connectivity to all religious sites nationwide to further enrich our cultural heritage  and thereby strengthen the fabric of our society.","Saturday, February 10, 2024",Union Budget,M,YSR Congress,Call For Action
3,SHRI RAMPRIT MANDAL,"I would like to express my gratitude to you  for giving me the opportunity to participate in the discussion on the Construction of  the Historic Shri Ram Temple and the consecration of Shri Ramlala. The name of  Ram is unforgettable to all of us on every occasion of life and the unveiling of the  idol of Ramlala and construction of the temple by our Hon. Prime Minister has been  a historic work. I request the Hon. Prime Minister that just as the Ram Mandir was  built in Ayodhya, similarly a grand temple should also be built at  Sitamarhi  in  Bihar, which is the birthplace of Maa Janaki.","Saturday, February 10, 2024",Union Budget,M,JDU,Call For Action
4,SHRI PRATAP CHANDRA SARANGI,"Lord Ram is a symbol of dignity.  Lord Shri Ram is the ideal of supreme character all over the world. He is also a  symbol and ideal of social harmony and national unity. Lord Rama incarnated to  organize society. He gave respect to the forest dwellers belonging to the neglected  section of the society who joined his army and he displayed social harmony through  his conduct and awakened the consciousness of love for the people. Some anti-social  elements are trying to destroy the Sanatan values and create confusion. The king  worships the people in the rule of the Hon. Prime Minister. The poor, mothers, youth  and common people are worshipped here. Lord Shri Ramchandra is the epitome of  our faith. He is the identity, pride and self-respect of this nation. On the basis of all  the evidence, the Shri Ram temple has been constructed as per the decision of the  Hon’ble Court. This temple is our National temple and Lord Shri Ram is a symbol  of virtues. Matri Bhakti, Pitri Bhakti, Guru Bhakti, patriotism, sacrifice, and national  effrontery all these find their basis in Lord Shri Ram. The previous Government had  compromised the defence of the nation but our Government, be it Pulwama or Uri,  responded through surgical strikes. We will not tease anyone, but we will not leave  anyone who teases us. The temple was built at the birthplace of Lord Rama by his  son Kush. This temple was destroyed by a foreign invader in 1033. Then in 1528,  the foreign invader Babar sent his commander called Mir Baqi Khan and got the  temple demolished. Efforts were made to free this temple continuously for 500 years.  Those supporting the Ram Temple never carried weapons with them. Hundreds of  Kar Sevaks died in the Ram Mandir movement. It is impossible to imagine India  without Ram. Only Ram can unite this country. When this country was divided on  caste lines owing to the recommendations made by the Mandal Commission, Ram  Temple ushered in unity to this country. It tied the country in the thread of unity.  During the tenure of our Government, this temple was inaugurated and Lord Shri  Ram was also consecrated. Lord Ram was completely non-communal, he  emancipated the fallen and embraced everyone. Lord Shri Ram is the symbol of this  universal sense of values. Our Government also works on the principle of 'Sabka  Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Prayas and Sabka Vishwas'.","Saturday, February 10, 2024",Union Budget,M,BJP,Appreciate

6,SHRI HANS RAJ HANS,"We are fortunate that we were born in India and  that Ayodhya is located in India. We deem ourselves to be lucky enough to belong  to the tradition of chanting Rama’s name. If one wishes to know Ram, harbouring  love and compassion is a prerequisite for it. He is unintelligible and beyond  comprehension if one is deficient in these two jewels. Prayers for the fulfilment of  wishes and inherent desires of the people have been granted by Him. The day of  22nd January ensued at the altar of innumerable lives dedicated to this cause that  enabled us to breathe a sigh of relief today. Lord Rama is the embodiment of love  and humanity. If one is inquisitive to know Lord Ram and be familiar to Him, one  will have to first espouse the essence of equality. The Socialism that we fondly refer  to quite often is attributed to Lord Rama. Today we talk big but one must not consign  it to oblivion that Lord Ram is such an entity that made sacrifices.  India also needs  Lord Rama at this time. Let’s take this nation to be Rama and act like Hanuman. Our  illustrious, vigorous and sage-like Prime Minister had fair and sacrosanct intentions,  he had reverence for Lord Rama, which is why the most important role of carrying  out of PranPratishtha was bequeathed to Him by the Almighty. If one really wishes  to be an ideal son, brother and good human being and have to even emerge as an  administrator steering the vehicle of good governance, one will have to adopt the  philosophy and the patterns of His conduct in life.","Saturday, February 10, 2024",Union Budget,M,BJP,Neutral
7,SHRI ARVIND SAWANT,"I am very happy that Lord Rama is being  discussed in this House today. The first political slogan in this country -‘Say with  pride we are Hindus’ was given by the venerable Bala Saheb Thackeray. The history  of 1992 is well known.  The Karsevaks had a big role in this. We mustn't forget them.  After the demolition of structure in 1992, Bala Saheb Thackeray ji was the only  person in India who had taken this responsibility. We believe that the temple of Lord  Ramchandra ji is our faith in this country, our identity, and the identity of this  country.All I would say is that Prabhu Ramchandra was the epitome of sacrifice,  commitment and truth. Lord Ramchandra Ji was sent into exile. On the demand of  His stepmother Kaikeyi, His father King Dasharath ordered Lord Rama Chandra to  go to the forest. He renounced power and went into exile. Ravana abducted Sitaji,  which led to the battle between Lord Ram and Ravana culminating in the killing  of Ravana. Prabhu Ramchandra ji did not take the reign. He bequeathed the seat  of power to Vibhishana.  The battle of Kishkindha took place. He stood with Sugriva  in the battle of Kishkindha. Kishkindha was won, however, Lord Ramchandra Ji  handed over the reign to Sugriva. This example is very important. Through these  precedents, I wish to highlight the critically important aspect that   Lord Ram ruled  the hearts of the people without assuming the seat of power and thus he became the  soul of the whole of India.","Saturday, February 10, 2024",Union Budget,M,Shiv Sena,Issue

I come from  Sitamarhi, the birthplace of Mother Sita. I respectfully salute the people of Sitamarhi  for giving me the opportunity to raise the problems of my area and get the  Government to develop my area or solve their problems. I want to tell everyone in  the House that just as we have witnessed the abrogation of Article 370, passing laws  regarding triple talaq, women's reservation and construction of temples in the 17th  Lok Sabha, in the same way, we can witness the construction of grand temple of  Sitaji in the 18th Lok Sabha.","Saturday, February 10, 2024",Union Budget,M,JDU,Call For Action
9,SHRI RAHUL RAMESH SHEWALE,"Before being elected to this Lok  Sabha, we contested elections with NDA and we were all elected MPs. But,  unfortunately, our leadership took a different decision after the Lok Sabha polls. We  didn't like that decision from that point on. Later, the Chief Minister of Maharashtra  state decided to join the NDA once again. We have full faith that Hon'ble Prime  Minister Modi will fully cooperate in taking forward the ideas of Balasaheb  Thackeray Ji. He fulfilled that faith. He fulfilled Balasaheb Thackeray’s dream of  abrogating Article 370 and constructing a grand Shri Ram temple in Ayodhya. The  17th Lok Sabha is a historic Lok Sabha for us. In the tenure of five years, we have  fulfilled all the promises made to the people like Article 370, Women's Reservation  Bill.

10,SHRI RAM MOHAN NAIDU KINJARAPU,"I would like to congratulate  our 140 crore Indians on  the Pran Pratishtha of Shri Ramlala in Ayodhya. Lord Ram  has been a part of our country’s identity for thousands of years. Lord Ram is  omnipresent from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Somnath to Pasighat. He is  celebrated not only in our country but also across various other countries like  Indonesia, Myanmar, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, etc. We remember Lord Ram in joy  as well as in sadness. Even before I knew anything about politics, I knew about the  virtues of Lord Ram and Ramayana. At the end of his great epic journey during his  vanvas for 14 years, he brought the integration of North and South India. We the  Telugu people of Andhra Pradesh have a very close association with the journey of  Lord Shri Ram, especially with places like Bhadrachalam, which is also called as  Dakshin Ayodhya.  He showcased such qualities that people across religions and  civilisations have a deep respect for him. His ideals and morals on governance which  we dearly called  ‘Ramrajya’ have long been considered to be the pinnacle of how a  Government must work. When Lord Ram decided to go to Lanka to protect Maa Sita  from the clutches of Ravana, his army did not consist  only of  one group. He chose  to work collectively with Lord Hanuman to Jatayu and from Laxshman to  Vibhishan.  Even a small animal like a squirrel came in support of Lord Ram. They  were all with him not merely because he was God but because he inspired them to  come together and achieve collective greatness. Similarly, Ram Rajya speaks about  the necessity of all parts of society working collectively together. A society cannot  grow if there is no collective growth.  Actually, Lord Ram is prevalent across all  sections and religions of our country. His ideals are relevant from education to  foreign policy and from governance to communal harmony.","Saturday, February 10, 2024",Union Budget,M,TDP,Neutral
11,SHRI ASADUDDIN OWAISI,"I stand against this Motion. I wonder how  Lok Sabha can speak in different voices. The Lok Sabha should speak in one voice.  Is this Government a Government of one community or one religion or is it the  Government of the people of all religions of the country? I believe this country has  no religion. I respect Maryada Purushottam Ram. Today, India's 17 crore Muslims  are taking themselves to be  strangers and alienated. I will never believe in false and  deceitful things now and will  continue to work within the ambit of the Constitution.  When the Prime Minister replies, will he speak for 140 crore people of India or will  he reply only to  those who care about Hindutva? Let me stand as a tall Indian  Muslim and say that the light of Indian democracy is at its dimmest today.  ","Saturday, February 10, 2024",Union Budget,M,AIMIM,Blame

I would like the voices of those people to be heard as well. The history of  Shri Ram ji is related to us also because the tribals supported Him in the battle.  People think that Ram rajya is a dream kingdom where there will be justice, peace  and brotherhood. We hope that there will be justice, peace and tranquility in India in  the seeds of time.

26,SHRI ADHIR RANJAN CHOWDHURY,"The coming to the close of the  current Winter Session of the Seventeenth Lok Sabha, marks yet an eventful  milestone in our Parliamentary history. The current Lok Sabha too has had its share  of tumultuous and also epoch-making events. We have witnessed the inauguration,  opening and shifting of our Parliamentary business to the new Parliament House.  We have commenced the journey of our Parliament from this new Parliament House  from 19th September 2023 onwards. I would like to recall the first Session of the  current Lok Sabha when Shri Om Birla was elected as the Speaker, Lok Sabha. Right  from the day of assuming Office, Shri Birla has been steadfastly taking and is  continuing to take a number of initiatives for smoothening and improving the  Parliamentary practices and processes and providing better amenities to the hon.  Members be it accommodation, medical facilities, transport, or appropriate support  mechanism for discharging one’s Parliamentary duties. Being the Chairperson of the  Public Accounts Committee, I am particularly grateful to the Speaker for his  leadership and guidance in holding the centennial celebrations of the PAC on a grand  scale in December, 2021.  The event was truly epoch-making in the history of the  Indian Parliament and its Committees. While we have discussed, debated and voted  upon a number of matters of public importance, we have also had a fair share of  adjournments and loss of business time of the House. This is a part and parcel of our  democratic process. Debate and discussion are the hallmarks of our Parliamentary  system. Despite the pulls and pressures of the times, the hon. The speaker has always  maintained his composure and tried to accommodate all sections of the House in  expressing their viewpoints and conducted the proceedings of the House with  diligence and dignity. The Opposition in the House played its role responsibly in  raising and debating on issues of immense public interest and concern that included  the fallout of the COVID pandemic on the common people, the threat posed to our  nation’s security, problems posed by pollution, rising levels of unemployment and  the effect of increasing inflationary pressures on the lives of common people. In the  previous Session, we witnessed an unfortunate incident of security breach in the  Parliament House which obviously is not a good sign and does not augur well. I am  sure that we will not be witnessing such incidents or face any form of security threat  in future. In statistical terms, the 17th Lok Sabha has been very productive with a  very significant number of legislations passed, questions posed, matters of public  importance raised during the Zero Hour and under Rule 377 and discussions held on  matters of public importance. As a responsible Opposition, we have always  endeavoured to strengthen our parliamentary system of governance and will  continue to do so. My Party has always stood and fought for preserving, protecting  and upholding our hard-earned freedom and democratic rights and we always  continue to do so. I would like to place on record my appreciation for the immense  amount of hard work and labour that the Secretariat staff, who work under the  administrative control of the Secretary-General have put and ensured that the  sessions of the House were held with precision and perfection. As the Leader of the  largest Opposition Party in the House, I would take this opportunity to express my  thanks and gratitude to the hon. Speaker for his help and support.

27,DR. KALANIDHI VEERASWAMY,"I would like to highlight the status of  the Indian economy since the pre-Independence era. After we got our Independence  in 1947 from British rule, India’s GDP was only about one per cent of the world’s  GDP. Our Government at that time faced the biggest challenge of nation-building.  Many things had to be taken care of. Poverty was the biggest threat to our nation at  that point in time. The Green Revolution and White Revolution were focused upon  to improve agricultural production and milk production. In 1991, the economy of the  country opened up and improved under the capable leadership of the then Prime  Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao and the Finance Minister Dr Manmohan Singh.  After assuming office, our Hon. Prime Minister promised that two crore jobs would  be offered to people every year and that the prices of gas and petrol would be halved.  Adding further it was also claimed that the exchange rate of the US dollar would be  reduced but even after ten years today there is no mention of these things in the  White Paper presented  by the Government. It does not find mention of  demonetization, its effects and achievements. All the opposition parties have been  asking for the same. The whole exercise of demonetization seems futile as there is  no mention of the same. This Government has only increased the cess throughout  the country since 2014. Over the last two years, the Government has imposed  windfall tax on oil companies. This windfall tax is for making excessive profits and  it has been informed that the cost of petrol and diesel is now market-driven and not  under their control. The Government claims to have alleviated 25 crore people out  of poverty but it is far from the truth. During the COVID period, eighty crore people  had to be provided free rations which is something commendable. Now after that  pandemic is over, the same promise has been repeated for the next five years. The  dependence of 80 crore people, which accounts for  55 per cent of the country's  population, on free ration for sustenance is a sad state of affairs. With reference to  the scams highlighted by the Hon. Minister, I would like to ask the Government why  no action had been taken by the present Government during their rule for ten years.

How can the country, public interest and public welfare be possible through such  narrow politics? Today, crores of people of the country are constantly suffering from  stressful life due to high inflation, immense poverty, unemployment, plight of  farmers and plight of rural India etc. It is very important for all political parties to  give up selfishness and hatred etc. and make a united effort on the most pressing  national problems of the country. The correct assessment of the policy and activities  of every Government depends on the better livelihood of the people and their  happiness and happy life. The record of both the Congress and BJP Governments in  this matter is neither remarkable nor commendable. If the record of UPA's 10-year  tenure had been excellent then BJP would not have got a chance to come to power  in the country. Similarly, if the tenure of the present Government in the last 10 years  had been excellent in terms of public interest, public welfare, national interest, social  and religious harmony, peace and order etc., then crores of people would  have  never  been so troubled and miserable in every sphere of life. Lack of expected  increase in the per capita income of the people of the country, big capitalists  becoming more prosperous, SC, ST and OBC reservations being made inactive and  ineffective and no significant reduction in corruption in common life, are some of  the issues for public interest. There are specific issues which continue to disturb  people and which are diverting the country from its ambitious objective of equitable  and welfare development.

30,SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD,"The white paper presented by the  Hon’ble Finance Minister is a very substantial step and the country should know  about it. There is also a discussion going on here to tell the country about it. It is a  very important day because economic reforms are also being discussed. I would like  to thank the Prime Minister who announced to confer Bharat Ratna on the architect  of reforms in the country's economy Narasimha Rao ji, farmers’ leader Charan Singh  ji, and great agricultural scientist Dr. Swaminathan ji. Our Government honours  those who work for the country. When we visit abroad, we should not criticise our  country. India has moved from the 'fragile five to the powerful five'. We have driven  the country from the world's eleventh economy to the fifth economy and will take it  forward to the third position in the next two years. Earlier, a scam used to be  exposed  every week but now the Government is headed by an honest Prime Minister and no  corrupt person will be spared. If someone indulges in corruption, he or she will  surely be punished. During the UPA regime, scams were committed everywhere.  The 2G scam was carried out under the guise of 'first come first serve'. Land was  taken from people in lieu of offering  them jobs in the Railways. Due to these scams,  the confidence of investors in the country was shaken and they started feeling that it  is no longer appropriate to invest capital in this country. But the situation has  changed after our Government was formed. The IMF and the world's largest  companies are saying today that India is one of the best economies in the world.  Now India has received the highest foreign investment. During the Corona  pandemic, under the leadership of the Hon'ble Prime Minister, the people of the  country were administered   Made in India vaccine free of cost, which has been a big  achievement. Our Government has improved India's economy and today 25 crore  people have been brought Above the Poverty line. India has made great strides in  the digital electronics sector and it is now the second-largest mobile phone  manufacturer in the world. As far as inflation is concerned, during the NDA regime,  the inflation rate was 3.9 per cent in the year 2004. Moving further, during the tenure  of the UPA, the inflation rate was 9.1 per cent in the year 2009, 12.3 per cent in 2010  and 10.5 per cent in 2011. Likewise, when the NDA again formed the Government,  the inflation rate was 6 per cent in 2015 and today it is only 5.5 per cent. It is a  universally acknowledged data. This White Paper is going to be a milestone in  parliamentary history.

I would like to focus on the reasons behind the  economic and policy stagnancy during the UPA regime and how dangerously it  compromised our economic and social security. A democratically-elected  Government was run by the unconstitutional authorities. I saw the translation of the  dreams of Late Bala Saheb Thackeray ji being fulfilled in this very House when the  Hon. Minister of Home Affairs abrogated Article 370 in this House. Today I feel  that the opposition here is talking about reforms under whose government there was  rampant corruption. In the last 10 years, the incumbent Prime Minister has honoured  all those who were betrayed by the opposition parties while in power. Today we are  passing through Amritkaal and the era of developed India. All our economic  indicators are positive. Our average inflation rate is  5 per cent which was 8.2 percent  during your tenure. Our forex reserves have leapfrogged from 303 billion dollars to  617 billion dollars. Our capital expenditure has increased from Rs. 2 lakh crore to  Rs. 9.5 lakh crore and the Non-Performing Asset (NPA) ratio has come down from  16 per cent to 6 per cent and we are the fastest-growing economy in terms of GDP  growth. Our defence production has crossed Rs. 1 lakh crore today. We built a  defence corridor. Our defence Budget is of Rs. 6 lakh crore. Secondly, we are proud  of our capital expenditure today that world-class infrastructure is being developed  across the country. The length of the high-speed corridor was 500 kilometers which  is 4 thousand kilometres today. The number of airports was 74, which has since more  than doubled to 149.

There was a legion of renowned economists in the UPA  Government, nevertheless, even then they spoilt the economy. We had no such  economists of that calibre, but still, we reformed the economy. During the reign of  Atal ji, sanctions were imposed on India. There was an Asian financial crisis, and  there was a war in Iraq, despite all these crises, Atal Ji's government had given us a  booming economy. The GDP growth rate was 8 percent, the fiscal deficit was around  3-4 percent, and inflation was 3-4 percent at that time. The fiscal deficit was also  around 6-8 percent during the UPA era. During the UPA period, capital expenditure  had come down to 16 percent, which has now again reached 28 percent. The  construction of national highways was only 12 km per day during the UPA reign,  which has increased to 28 km per day during our time. We are confident enough to  say that our economy is of four trillion dollars, it will cross five trillion and ten trillion  too. Our Government has made the banking system very robust. During Atal Ji's  Government, the net NPA was almost reduced to 6-8 percent. The UPA had increased  it to 16 percent. Now the bank NPA remains around 4 percent. Today our banks have  become strong once again after changing the creditor culture through the Insolvency  and Bankruptcy Code. Today, the rupee is one of the strongest currencies in the  world.

If GDP was 5.9 percent during the NDA regime, then what about  the rate of unemployment? Why has the Prime Minister not undertaken an  employment survey since 2011? The consumption survey has not been conducted  since 2017. The dollar was at Rs 43 during the year 2005, while it reached to Rs 83  during 2014. How did it reach to $ 83? There is a net increase of 40 rupees. The  foreign currency reserve was at $ 294 billion in 2011. By the year 2013, it rose to  256 billion. Health expenditure from pocket which was 69 percent in the year 2005  has increased to 64.2 percent in the year 2014. In the White Paper at least you give  the data for the year 2020.

In the country also, they have brought  in the present Prime Minister so that they can deal with this kind of corruption that  is happening in the country and in the State also. From 2014 to 2019, not a single  case of corruption was reported in the State of Andhra Pradesh. There might have  been differences between the State and the Centre. They were purely in terms of how  to make progress in the country and in the State. In 2019Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy  came back to power by fooling the people of Andhra Pradesh, by giving them false  assurances.

Regarding the fiscal deficit data, if you take the entire tenures together, the  fiscal deficit during Dr. Manmohan Singh Ji’s Government was 4.48 percent while  during this  Government it was 5.8 per cent. Jan Dhan was a product which was  started earlier and there were 34 crore bank accounts. Eventually, they took it to 51  crore accounts which is not a great achievement.

The development of these  tribes will be considered as per the caste-based census. The present Government has  proposed the constitution of committees only to discuss this issue from time to time.  Today our Government is in power both at the Center and in Maharashtra and in such  a situation justice should be given properly. Dhangar should definitely come within  four Lok Sabha seats out of 48. Dhangar society has had a history. Ahilyabai Holkor ji  was the queen in the 18th century, who worked for her society. Today, Dhangar  community has been demanding a place from the Government of Maharashtra for  many years to build a memorial of Ahilyabai Holkar in Jalna district.

We have also learnt about increasing cases of cancer which manifest  after months and years of a water body being polluted.  This is a question of national  public health and the lives of Indians are at risk. The upper limit for the penalty  specified in the amendments is not enough to deter polluters. While higher penalties  are definitely required, penalties alone will not be sufficient. It is important that at  least, in extreme cases, imprisonment must be there. We need laws and amendments  that will oblige companies to mandatorily treat their waste. Funds collected from  penalties shall be dedicated not only to compensate all the affected parties adequately  but also towards building new infrastructure and technology that can restore the  quality of water in our lakes, rivers as well as the groundwater.

As per the amendments, crediting of penalties to EPF  is a step in the right direction. However, efforts must be made to ensure funds are  efficiently utilised. A three-tier model can be used to access the penalty amount which  considers the history of violation, unlawful gains from the act of pollution, and  pollution clean-up cost for calculating the penalty. Moreover, the Government  officials imposing penalties should be at least in the rank of Joint Secretary to the  State Government or the Central Government. At the same time, if aggrieved parties  approach the NGT, then the justice should be ensured to be delivered within a  prescribed time-frame.

Application of Artificial Intelligence is  on the rise, and unfortunately, it is being weaponized against women. It is regrettably  being done via deep fakes, among other reprehensible acts. Higher budgetary  allocation is required to deal with such new threats. The Andhra Pradesh Government  has consistently sought an increase in MGNREGA man-days, proposing an  augmentation from 100 to 150 days for individuals and a total of 16 crore man-days.  Given the prevailing drought conditions leading to rural migration, the State urges the  Central Government to support its economy by enhancing MGNREGA man-hours  and incorporating new initiatives under the scheme. I urge the Government to  formulate and implement a time-bound plan for granting special category status to  Andhra Pradesh promptly, providing the necessary support to address the unfair losses  incurred due to illogical bifurcation. The Polavaram Irrigation Project is a project of  national importance and it is of huge importance for the people of Andhra Pradesh.  The total cost of the project is Rs.55,548.87 crores at the 2017-18 price level as  approved by the Technical Advisory Committee. However, this Revised Cost  Estimate is not yet approved by the Central Government. Further, funding for Phase-1  completion has been limited to Rs.12,911.15 crore but this amount is inadequate for  providing rehabilitation and resettlement to the 36 additional villages and 48  habitations. Hence, the Andhra Pradesh Government submitted a proposal of Revised  Cost Estimates of Rs.17,144.06 crore for Phase-1 of the project which includes the  cost of such rehabilitation as well. It is requested that the Revised Cost Estimate be  approved by the Technical Advisory Committee and the Revised Cost Estimate for  Phase-1 and provide compensation of  the additional cost of Rs.4222.91 crore incurred  by the Andhra Pradesh Government for resettlement and rehabilitation. Production  activities in all NTC mills were suspended from March 2020 due to the COVID-19  pandemic. The Central Government should take immediate action to make the NTC  mill in Tirupati fully functional to provide relief and support to the BPL families  through its operations.","Wednesday, February 7, 2024",Union Budget,M,YSR Congress,Blame
83,SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR,"First of all, I would like to express a debt of  gratitude to the Hon. Prime Minister for conferring Bharat Ratna on our Jan Nayak  Karpuri Thakur ji this year. It is a tribute for all the people of Bihar to their respected  leader. This makes 14 crore people of Bihar proud. This Budget is not a populist one  but has paved the way to strengthen the economy of the country, which has taken  special care of farmers, youth, the poor and women. We hope that in the year 2024,  when NDA's government is formed with an overwhelming majority, many important  and historic decisions will be taken in the interest of the countrymen in the full Budget  of July. It will achieve the goal of making India a developed Country by the year  2047. Hon. Minister of Finance in her Budget Speech has emphasised that east and  North-East India will be made the growth engines of the country. Maize and Makhana  are mostly grown in the Seemanchal region of Bihar. Our demand is that when the  full-time Budget is presented, initiatives should be taken to set up Maize and  Makhana-based industries in Seemanchal so that our biggest problem of human  resource migration can be tackled. Hon. Finance Minister has announced the  manufacturing of 40,000 Vande Bharat coaches. This is a good thing. I request the  Hon. Railway Minister to kindly ensure that the fare of Vande Bharat remains  affordable to the middle class. There is a mention of the upgradation of the railways in  the Interim Budget. My constituency Purnia is divided into two parts in the case of  railways. It is divided into the Northeast Frontier Railway and East Central Railway.  This is the reason why Purnia is not getting the kind of railway facilities that it  actually deserves.  Two railway projects in our region are pending. We have been  making a demand to this effect for a long time. Therefore, we demand from the  Government that both of the projects should be made operational. There is a four-lane  National Road, Vidupur-Dalsingh Sarai, Simri Bakhtiyarpur-Purnia Green Field  Access Road, which is likely to be sanctioned soon; this may also be sanctioned and  constructed. Purnia-Khagaria road, which is now called Super Express, should be  converted into four lanes and provision should be made in the Budget for the same.  The work of level crossing number 91 connecting Siswan to Siwan City is pending, it  may also be completed through the Hon. Railway Minister. There is no train from  Purnia to Patna. So please introduce a train there. I conclude by supporting the Budget  introduced by the Finance Minister.","Wednesday, February 7, 2024",Union Budget,M,JDU,Neutral
84,SHRI GIRISH CHANDRA,"In the Rajya Sabha recently, the Hon. Education  Minister said that 32 thousand students dropped out of higher education midway, out  of which 52 percent of students belong to the SC, ST and OBC categories. It is a very  serious matter. I demand that Dalit, exploited, backward and vulnerable people may  be enrolled on zero balance and efforts need to be taken to educate them. According to  the statement of the present Government, lakhs of youth have been offered  Government jobs in mission mode, but it has remained just an election Jumla. Nearly  10 lakh posts are lying vacant in the Union Ministries and Departments. As on March  1, 2021, only 30.55 lakh employees are working against 40.35 lakh sanctioned posts.  The Government should take measures to fill these vacancies at the earliest and  provide employment to the unemployed. The Government says that arrangements  have been made to provide free ration to 80 crore countrymen. If you work to give  free ration to 80 crore people in this country,  it shows the scale of  unemployment in  our country. You are not giving employment to a poor person, but you are doing the  work of giving ration to him/her. If the Government talks about making an Atma  Nirbhar Bharat,  provide a Government job to the families of these 80 crore people  based on  their qualifications. The Government introduced the Pradhan  Mantri Awas  Yojana. If the Government  wants to make this scheme a reality, landless people ought  to be given  residential leases on  the Government owned land in the Municipal  Corporation, Nagar Palika, and Nagar Panchayats, and work on making them part of  the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. There is also a mention of women empowerment.  In this context, I would like to say that 44,5256 cases related to atrocities against  women have been registered in the year 2022,  meaning thereby  about 51 FIRs per  hour. This makes us think that the Government has failed to protect women. The  Government has arranged Ayushman cards for Anganwadi workers. It is a good  initiative of the Government but their honorarium is very low.  By affording them the  status of Government servants, the Government can certainly offer them a dignified  life. The Government repeatedly ignores the interests of the farmers. According to the  recent NCRB data, the highest numbers of 12,227 suicides have been committed by  farmers and agricultural workers in Maharashtra, due to loss of crops, loss of land and    non-repayment of loans, etc. Therefore, it is very sad and concerning to ignore the  lives of the people reeling under poverty, unemployment, inflation, etc. I would like to  draw your attention to the toll plazas situated on the National Highway in Bijnor and  Nagina parliamentary constituency in my home district. A free toll is already proposed  for vehicles plying from Bijnor via NH-34. It is a two-lane road used by farmers and  local residents of the area. No commercial vehicle passes through this road. According  to the NHAI, all local residents within a radius of 10 km have been exempted from  toll, yet why is the government wasting money on the construction of a toll plaza  between Bijnor and Kotwali Road? I request you to kindly stop the construction of the  toll plaza between Bijnor and Kotwali.","Wednesday, February 7, 2024",Union Budget,M,BSP,Blame
85,SHRIMATI SUPRIYA SADANAND SULE,"I compliment the Hon’ble  Finance Minister for all the efforts that she has made. I have a few suggestions for  improvement in the larger interest of the nation. The Government maintains that it is  the Government of farmers. Ban on the export of onions leaves the worst impact on  the farmer It has been for the first time in history ban has been imposed by the               Government of the day on the export of farmers’ produce.  Lift ban on the export of  Onions. The Government keeps on claiming that the income of the farmers has been  doubled. But what is the data to prove it? The farmers of Maharashtra are in trouble  today. There is no water in many places. Wherever the farmers are in distress in  Maharashtra and in the country, their loans should be waived. The Government says  that it is a Government of the poor. If the government has eradicated poverty, then  why is the number of people being provided food grains i.e. 80 crore is not on the  decline? It is fraught with contradictions. So, this is something the Government owes  us an answer thereto. There are more than 50 crore accounts under Jan DhanYojana.  Most of them are operated by the females. Public sector Banks are cloaking profits.  Why does the Bank need so much profit? If this is a government of the poor, then  increase the interest rate on the money deposited by the poor in their Jan Dhan  Accounts. More than 22 crore youth have applied for 7.5 lakh jobs.Unemployment is  one of the biggest challenges. The government is doing so much for the youth, but  jobs are not being created for them. Artificial intelligence is going to happen.It is  going to disrupt our lives. Jobs are going to change. It is because technology has  changed our lives. So, what is this Government’s plan for unemployment? The  government says so much about the Ujjwala scheme, but the refills are not more than  50%.People cannot afford it.  If the government wants to do something for women,  then increase the wages of Anganwadi and Asha workers, make them permanent and  also give them pensions. Today, there are many senior citizens in EPS-95, who are not  getting money. Where did the money of EPS - 95 go? There is no improvement in the  country in terms of corruption index. There is no clarity in the policy of this  Government for crypto currency. Four engines of growth, private consumption,  private investment, exports, etc., are not doing well.  The Government talks about  cooperative federalism.  As far as the devolution of tax is concerned, the Fifteenth  Finance Commission has said that it should be 41 per cent. Now it is only 30 and 35  percent. The State Governments are asking for 50 per cent.  Where is this cess and  surcharge going?  Capital expenditure is ballooning every year.  I am not against  infrastructure.  But, if this economy has to do better, it has to be not only an  infrastructure but every vertical should be included. I request this Government that if  it keeps putting money into infrastructure and only into Government expenditure, it is  not a sustainable model.","Wednesday, February 7, 2024",Union Budget,F,NCP,Call For Action
86,SHRI BHARTRUHARI MAHTAB,"As this is an interim Budget, the Finance  Bill has been made accordingly. Tax benefits for startups, Sovereign Wealth Fund,  pension funds and some IFSCs are being extended up to March 2025. While going  through the Bill, I found that it has been very categorically mentioned that this Act  may be called the Finance Act, 2024 relating to direct tax which is before us for our  consideration. The Finance Minister has summed it up that it is only to extend certain  aspects of benefits, which are supposed to be extended up to March 2025. Another  point is that it is a general perception that agricultural income is not being taxed but it  has been categorically stated now in this Finance Bill that it is being taxed. Coming to  the indirect tax aspect my only suggestion is, why do we not have a better, structured  discussion on the functioning of the GST mechanism? The Finance Minister had  announced withdrawing outstanding tax demands upto Rs.25000 in disputed cases  pertaining to the financial year 2009-10 and upto Rs. 10000 from 2010-11 and 2014- 15. This move is expected to benefit about a crore of tax-payers and will help reduce  the backlog of disputed tax significantly. It is a welcome step and the House would  support this provision. I would also say that the Income Tax Act or the direct tax  provisions need thorough interpretation. I would request the Hon. Minister to look  into the functioning of the tribunals meant for tax-related cases. Through this bill the  Government is closing the cases pending since 1962 and the cases pertaining to the  demand of Rs.5, 10 or 25 thousand but in the absence of written instructions from the  Government, these will remain pending and become a burden on the tax department.

Everyone knows  about DBT. We Provided Bank accounts to 50 crore people and deposited Rs 34 lakh  crore directly into people's Bank accounts through DBT and about Rs 3 lakh crore has  been saved through this.

We have lifted 25 crore people from extreme poverty. We  are saying this under the Multidimensional Poverty Indicator. Don't just look at the  data obtained from foreign agencies. You also look at the data collected in India. From  2014 to 2019, when we started Amritkal, we achieved second place in the world in  smart phone manufacturing through Production Linked Incentive. We gave  production-linked incentives for solar panels and batteries and today these are being  made in our country. Today we have ordered more than 1000 planes.

Every month 18 lakh crore transactions are taking place through UPI. If  the previous regimes used to make passenger trains, then we are making Bullet Train,  Amrit Bharat and Vande Bharat Train. Three more railway economic corridors are  being built. A Green Hydrogen Mission is going on and we are making biofuels,  which will benefit our farmers. When one crore houses get solar panels under  Suryodaya Yojana, every family will save Rs 15 to 18 thousand every year. We are  also lending top priority to science, technology and innovation. We have millions of  start-ups. Be it space, drones, or agri tech, our start-ups are coming up everywhere.

88,SHRI VINAYAK BHAURAO RAUT,"By using new words and  technologies, our Finance Minister has presented this confusing and misleading  budget, which is a gimmick in itself. It has been mentioned that the Government is  providing food grains free of cost to 80 crore people in this country. It means the  Finance Minister has accepted that 80 crore people are still living below the poverty  line. A few years ago, the Finance Minister mentioned that we are going to become a  five trillion dollar economy very soon. I do not know whether we have achieved that  target or not. The Finance Minister has mentioned that our total tax collection has  increased threefold during these years. Then why are people still languishing in abject  poverty? The MUDRA scheme was launched and our young boys and girls  approached banks to get the benefits of this scheme. But later the banks stopped  providing MUDRA loans to the poor and needy youths of this country. We often talk  about 'Annadaata', our farmers. However, we do not take any initiative to ensure MSP  for farmers. In my state Maharashtra, our soybean, cotton and pigeon pea-growing  farmers are distressed and they are not getting remunerative prices any more. The  export of soybeans is banned by the Government and they are importing it. So, all the  soybean, cotton etc. producing farmers are facing acute problems. I would like to  request the Union Government to fix MSP. To ensure tele-connectivity and also to  improve the telecommunication network, around 25000 4G towers had to be installed.  But it has not been installed till date in my constituency. Konkan Railway is our pride  and honour. It connects North India with South India. Konkan Railway is a  Government company.

Punjabi language should be made mandatory in the city.  The officers of Chandigarh should be taken based on the ratio of 60:40 in favour of  Punjab. But the Government has tinkered with this rule. Punjab is the only State  which does not have its capital city. It has no rights over its river waters. Congress  party had done a grave injustice to Punjab and gave our river water to Rajasthan. The  riparian principles were not followed whereby the first right of river water lies with  Punjab. In BBMB, our member was there. The laws were changed and there is no  member of Punjab in the Board and members from outside have been brought to fill  the seats in BBMB. 21,000 acres worth of land in our border belt lies beyond the  barbed wire fence. The farmers have to cultivate this land with great difficulty. So, I  urge upon the Government to grant compensation packages to these border farmers, as  was done during the time of Vajpayee ji and Badal ji.  Please open our border with  Pakistan for trade so that Punjab too can prosper again. Border districts of Punjab  should be given the status of 'Backward district' and special packages and grants  should be given to these districts.

The Government has allocated and released  about Rs. 800 crore for the Badnera wagon railway factory in Amravati. The condition  of farmers who are cultivating cotton, soybean, tur, gram, moong, orange, etc., is very  poor. Therefore, the Government needs to increase the Kisan Samman Nidhi from Rs.  6000 to 12000.

The government has still not listened to the  demands of the farmers which shows that the government is not sensitive towards the  condition of farmers in the country. There is not even a single serious step taken by  the government to bring black money.  The government should bring a white paper on  the steps taken by the government to bring back black money. The budget fails to  address measures to check inflation and generate employment. It clearly reflects that  the slogan of ""Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas"" is a mirage for the marginalized groups in  the country. The unemployment rate is as high as 20% in a few states.  The  government is not concerned about the issues of the youth of the country. There is  nothing in this budget for the salaried middle class.  They don't even consider the  impact of household inflation and price rise on them. Rubber producers in Kerala are  not receiving adequate compensation for their products compared to the cost of  production.  I strongly urge the government to establish a minimum price of Rs 250  per kilogram for rubber. Compounded rubber (CR) will continue to be imported at nil  duty from ASEAN countries. There was not a word in the budget on the government's  intention to legalise minimum support price (MSP) or on providing guaranteed  income to farmers.

This will provide  employment as well as economic benefits to the State. Mahavikas Pradhikaran scheme  must be implemented in Azamgarh. The work of laying tap water lines, sewer lines  and gas pipelines must be done simultaneously so that the villagers do not have to face  a lot of trouble due to the frequent digging of village roads. There have been arenas of  famous wrestlers in all five assembly constituencies of the Lalganj region. There is a  need for a modern auditorium or mini stadium for wrestling at these places. These  wrestlers must be encouraged. Red chilli cultivation takes place on a large scale in the  Phulpur assembly of Lalganj. Red chilli cultivation must be promoted here by  establishing a training and processing institute, as there is immense potential for  employment opportunities in this area. Under the One District One Product, means for  import and export of black pottery from my area should be provided and a market  should also be provided for the same. From the Shahi bridge to Belwai, 40 kilometres  away in Azamgarh district, which connects three assembly constituencies - Sadar,  Nizamabad, and Phulpur, the condition of the road is extremely dilapidated.

It is requested to allow  admission on zero balance so that lakhs of children can be admitted to technical  education. The amount of funds given under PM Awas Yojana must be increased to  Rs 5 lakh in view of inflation because the rates of soil, sand, bricks, cement and iron  have doubled in the last 5 years. The Old Pension Scheme must be implemented once  again. The Government should increase the amount of Kisan Samman Nidhi to Rs 6  thousand per instalment. Instead of limiting Ayushman Yojana only to families of 6  members, this benefit should also be given to those having 5 or 4 family members.

India  is the root of the tree. The provinces are her branches. Further, the onus of running the  nation is on both the Centre and the states. The “My tax, my right” argument is  against the spirit of the Constitution as well as against the Federal structure of the  nation. The time is ripe to condemn such a divisive and anti-constitutional mentality.  Those who claim to be socialists argue that redistribution of wealth is the basis of  socialism and have won elections on such claims, are talking about “my tax, my right”  issue. If one goes on pressing for “my tax, my right” claim, is it possible to run the  nation or the State of Karnataka? If taking a cue from their “my tax, my right”  argument, the coal-producing states such as Bihar, Jharkhand and others refuse to  supply coal to Karnataka, is it possible to run the country? During the last five years,  Karnataka has been at the top of the FDI chart. The reason is the schemes such as  Make in India, Digital India and the Prime Minister's foreign policy success. All these  initiatives helped Karnataka to progress.

In Jammu and  Kashmir, the National Conference, PDP and Congress families continued their  plundering and looting for 70 years and deprived the people of Jammu and  Kashmir of the rights conferred upon them by the Constitution.

It can be said that this law would deter further leaks, as a  specific law to punish the wrongdoers. There are a few positive things in this Bill  which I would like to point out.  The Bill is designed to increase the transparency,  fairness, and credibility of public examination systems. The Bill serves as a model  draft for States, offering them the discretion to adopt its provisions. The Bill deters  against unfair practices. Here are some suggestions from my Party. Why is a  candidate given immunity from the Bill if he indulges in malpractices that lead to  the examination process being vitiated? I would be happy if the Hon. Minister  could clarify this limitation of the functioning of the Bill if the candidate is a  wrongdoer. The Bill's implementation might require significant financial and  human resources, raising concerns about its practicality and effectiveness,  especially in rural or resource-limited settings. Has the hon. Minister made a plan  to ensure that such limitations of resources do not limit the effectiveness of the  Bill. In conclusion, The Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Bill, of  2024 represents a pivotal stride towards ensuring integrity and fairness in public  examination systems. However, the Bill does raise certain concerns that merit  further clarification and planning. With the right measures and continued  oversight, this Bill has the potential to significantly enhance the credibility of our  public examination systems, fostering a more just and merit-based society.

157,SHRI SUMEDHANAND SARASWATI,"Today I have got the opportunity  to put forth my views on the Public Examination (Prevention of Unfair Means)  Bill, 2024. This Bill has come after a very long time to prevent unfair means in the  examinations. This Bill should have been introduced a long time ago. I represent  Rajasthan and almost all the speakers have discussed Rajasthan. Here 17 papers  were leaked in five consecutive years. In Rajasthan, if there is any education hub  after Kota, it is Sikar where two lakh students study and it is my Lok Sabha  constituency. Many colleagues have expressed doubts that no student should be  harmed by this Bill, but upto what extent any student can cheat sitting inside the  examination hall? The problem was that there were such institutions which used to  arrange cheating in a planned manner by taking students as shields. Hence the SIT  has been constituted in Rajasthan. More than 20 people have been arrested so far.  A child committed suicide there. The child left behind him a note written that my  father worked as a labourer and provided me for education for two years, took a  loan on the land, but when I went to appear for the exam, I was informed that the  paper was out. He was a student of Bhadra tehsil of Hanumangarh district. That  student wrote this in the suicide note.  There were so many criminal activities of  this kind.  It is not only a matter of copying, but the worthy people were left and  the unworthy were selected. He had a great loss. The second reason is that injustice  was done with the deserving person. He suffered, so there was no means of taking  away his suffering. Thirdly, it was encouraging corruption. This will make sure  that the person who is worthy, who has worked hard, who has made effort, will get  justice and the person who deserves it will get the opportunity to reach there.  Along With it many colleagues have said that the provision of punishment is very   harsh in it. In our scriptures, a person is disciplined only by the fear of punishment  and without discipline, a system can never be established. Therefore, I would like  to request that efforts should be made to motivate the States also in this direction  because the root cause lies in the states. The minister has mentioned many exams  in this bill itself that he will try this in these examinations.  But with regard to the  situation within the States, I would like to request all the State Governments to  bring these types of Bills there, so that this copying business and this kind of  corruption that is going on, is eliminated and deserving persons are selected. I  would like to thank the Honourable Prime Minister and the Honourable Minister  again that they have brought a good bill and today the two lakh students who study  in my area are happy to see that the Government of India has announced something  good for us. The Government of India has thought about us, about our future. The  dream of the Prime Minister is that we will make a developed India in 2047 will  become a better India only when qualified people reach there and they will reach  only when there are examinations with a fair approach, proper systems are in place,  and unfair resources are stopped.","Tuesday, February 6, 2024",Union Budget,M,BJP,Neutral
158,SHRI RAJIV PRATAP RUDY,"Today a Bill has been brought which  seeks to prevent the use of unfair means in public examination. Now the results of  the examination have nothing to do with the job. Corruption entered into it in such  a way that there was a competition for marks in the institutions and forced all the  states and the government of the country to conduct separate examinations. Earlier,  there were no exams for Government jobs but now this tradition has started. In the  last five years, I have analysed 15 states. Such illegal or inappropriate recruitment  took place at about 41 places in 15 states. There were eligibility tests for the  recruitment of teachers, police, foresters, and engineers. This was the situation in  the last 30-40 years. Bihar is a state where if we cannot set up a factory, then we  study and get a government job that is employment. We the people of Bihar raise  our standard of living by taking government jobs, this is also a formula. The  examination was held in Telangana in 2020, the High Court stayed it. About  150,000 candidates are waiting for it. What is the fault of the children who study  honestly that this kind of situation exists? All these laws should have come a little  earlier. Our Prime Minister should have become the Prime Minister of this country  a little earlier. Had he become the Prime Minister 20-25 years ago, at least many  wrongdoer Chief Ministers would not have been in jail today. They would have  also understood that the law of this country has been so made that if they did  something wrong, they would go to jail. I support this Bill. With the introduction  of this law, in the coming days, honest candidates will get justice and their merit  will be recognized.","Tuesday, February 6, 2024",Union Budget,M,BJP,Neutral
159,DR. THOL THIRUMAAVALAVAN,"My first and foremost demand  would be that people belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes should  be given reservation as per their population. Similarly in some States, the rendering  of some caste names of SCs and STs is disrespectful. Therefore, I urge upon the  Union Government to bring amendments to the Constitution extending powers to  States to amend the rendering of such Caste names in the lists of SCs and STs. In  Tamil Nadu, there are 74 Castes in the list of Scheduled Castes. People belonging  to these Scheduled Castes which I have listed are unable to compete with other  SCs in the list who are more in number than them. They are deprived of education  and employment opportunities among this lot. Anthropologically they belong to  nomadic tribes. If such Castes are included in the list of Scheduled Tribes, they  may get opportunities in getting education and employment. I, therefore, urge upon  the Union Minister to include these Scheduled Castes in the list of STs.","Tuesday, February 6, 2024",Union Budget,M,VCK,Issue

In the past, various  exams of many states like Haryana, Bihar, Gujarat, Rajasthan etc. have been  cancelled due to question paper leaks. According to newspaper reports, more than  1.4 crore candidates have been affected by paper leaks from 2016 to 2023. I  demand from the government that if the examination is cancelled due to any  reason, then the fees charged by the candidates should also be refunded. Today we  live in a society where the pressure to succeed in examinations is very high, which  is often driven by the severe consequence of unemployment and underemployment  in the private sectors prevailing in the country. This worrying trend speaks  volumes about the systemic failures affecting our education system. The Bill fails  to adequately address this aspect. Examinations are cancelled due to cheating and  malpractice and this result in an increase in unemployment. I would request the  Government to run a special campaign to fill lakhs of vacant posts in the Central  Government and state governments so that unemployment can be reduced. At the  same time, the penal system for copying and misconduct should be made more  stringent.","Tuesday, February 6, 2024",Union Budget,F,BSP,Call For Action

He has taken such a big  reform step in the interests of the students. In Jharkhand, students were lathi- charged. I request that there should be an immediate inquiry into it by the CBI.  Those who are guilty, even if they are the highest officials, should be put in jail.  The Prime Minister has given such a big gift to the youth and students.

Has there been any specific object to uplift the people of Jammu and  Kashmir by the Government of India? That needs to be clarified. No specific  projects or ideas have been tabled in the House to improve the lives of the people  of Jammu and Kashmir. Only the implementation of the reservation policy will not  serve the purpose. The provision of punishment for atrocities on backward people  has not been highlighted. In 2022 alone, there were nearly 60,000 atrocities against  the Schedule Castes and 10,064 atrocities against the Schedule Tribes. As per the  NCRB data, the crime against tribals has been increasing year after year. Just in 2  years, from 2020 to 2022, there has been nearly 22 per cent increase in crimes  against tribals. Madam, the gross enrolment ratio of SC and ST students at the  undergraduate level is at 23 per cent and 17.2 per cent respectively whereas the  national average is 26.3 per cent. The Eklavya Schools are meant for SC and ST  students. But, still, 38,000 vacancies across the country have not been filled up.  You are setting up schools, Colleges and Universities if the vacancies have not  been filled. Students will come and there will be no teachers to teach me, how will   their education takes place. We have witnessed that the amount allotted for the  Union Government’s Umbrella Scheme for Development of Scheduled Castes and  the Umbrella Programme for Development of Scheduled Tribes has been  underspent. Sir, these schemes underspent nearly 28 per cent and 24 per cent of the  amount respectively. Please restore the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir to these  people. In the name of demonetization, the people of the country were made to  stand in queues, many lost their lives. Terrorism has not stopped to date. Our  soldiers are sacrificing their lives every day. You are hurting the federal structure.  Ministry spent only 20 per cent less than what they were allotted. We need more  schemes for the welfare of students and also for the welfare of SCs, STs, OBCs  and minorities. We have started the Kanyashree scheme which is benefitting 78  lakh women in West Bengal and which has been recognised by the United Nations.

Dr. Baba  Saheb Ambedkar wrote the Constitution and through this Constitution, every poor  of the country got his rights. But Baba Saheb could not get the respect he deserved.  Under the leadership of Hon'ble Prime Minister Babasaheb Ambedkar Ji was  honored by developing five places associated with Babasaheb's life as  'Panchteerth'. It was an honour for all people belonging to the scheduled class and  all the households of the country. The Valmiki community used to do the work of  cleaning and scavenging in the village. But when the Prime Minister launched the  Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in the entire country and in that Swachh Bharat Abhiyan,  all the citizens of the country were engaged in cleaning with brooms in their hands  and now no one could say to any person that if he/she was a sweeper, then he must  belong to the Valmiki community. Along with this, the work of honoring the  people of all the scheduled castes in the country has been done through various  schemes. We have seen that when the Hon'ble Prime Minister inaugurated the  airport in Ayodhya while doing 'Pran Pratishtha' of Shri Ram temple, the airport  was also named after Maharishi Valmiki ji. Through this Bill, the work of giving  rights to the Valmiki Samaj will be done, who were earlier deprived of their rights  and were also deprived of benefitting from various schemes of the state and  Central Government.","Tuesday, February 6, 2024",Union Budget,M,BJP,Appreciate

In the first  session of the new Parliament House, a historic decision was taken in the interest  of the women of the country and Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam was enacted and  it was a beginning of a new era by providing 33 percent reservation to women in  the Lok Sabha and Legislative Assemblies of the country. Ever since our  Government came into power, the country has moved towards progress at every  step. The decisions taken by this Government in the national interest have  benefited every citizen of the country. In these 10 years, the Union Government  brought many public welfare schemes. Jan Dhan Yojana, Ayushman Yojana,  Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana and Ujjwala Yojana have transformed  the lives of crores of people and a large section of the country has benefited from  these schemes. We are celebrating Amrit Mahotsav considering the 75th year of  independence. Today we are the fifth economic power in the world and very soon  we will become the third economic power of the world. The aim of our  Government is to provide housing to all. After the G-20 conference, the image of  our country has improved across the world. Today, after years of waiting, Ram  temple has been constructed. The Government has abolished the evil practice of  triple talaq forever. Our country has become the first country to land on the South  Pole of the Moon. The Government has fulfilled a long-standing demand by  implementing One Rank - One Pension. On August 5, 2019, the Government  abolished the special status of Jammu and Kashmir by abrogating Article 370 from  Jammu and Kashmir and divided Kashmir into two parts and made it a Union  Territory. Lakhs of farmers are getting the benefits of Prime Minister Kisan  Samman Nidhi. The Ayushman Bharat scheme is proving to be a lifeline for the  poor. Through this scheme, zero-balance bank accounts of lakhs of poor people  have been opened. Now the benefits of the schemes run by the Government are  directly transferred into Jan Dhan accounts.","Monday, February 5, 2024",Union Budget,M,Shiv Sena,Appreciate
192,DR. SATYA PAL SINGH,"This great House of Great India is a symbol of  “Ek Bharat, Shreshth Bharat''. This House is the House of independent India.  Congress party made the country secular in the name of secularism and divided the  states on the basis of language and they made a mockery of Sanatan culture. Such  articles were inserted in the Indian Constitution that in this country, minorities  were given more rights and the rights of the majority were reduced. We celebrated  the 75th year of the country's independence as Amrit Mahotsav. Lakhs of epitaphs  were written in the glory of our heroes. Ross Island in the Andaman was named  after Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. 21 islands of Andaman Islands were named  after the Param Vir Chakra winners of the country. Veer Bal Diwas was declared  in the name of the Shehzadas of Guru Gobind Ji. Mother tongue was given priority  under the National Education Policy. Indian knowledge system was given priority  within the National Education Policy. Now the time has come to eliminate all signs  of slavery from this country. The name of this country is Bharat, so we should  change its name from India to Bharat again. By the year 2047, we will make our  country self-reliant, fully developed and Vishwa Guru again. After a long struggle  and sacrifices of about 500 years, a grand Ram temple has been built in Ayodhya.  It is the embodiment of the faith of crores of people of this country and it is also  the embodiment of their energy. During the freedom movement, Mahatma Gandhi  used to say that Ram Rajya would be established. Our hon’ble Prime Minister  Modi ji is also continuously fighting and determined to re-establish Ram Rajya in  the country. My parliamentary constituency Baghpat, despite being a part of Delhi  NCR, was far away from development. It was suffering backwardness for decades.

The World’s Anti­Doping Agency  had long been exerting pressure on NADA to frame a law against doping. The  proposed Bill intends to make this law as a preventive law instead of making it a  criminal law. This legislation will check the athletes from indulging in doping  and will also penalise them for any violation including disqualification from the  sporting event results, seizure of medal, marks, award, disqualifying the sports­ person from participating in sporting events for a certain period of time and  imposition of financial sanctions. With the passage of this legislation, the  powers of the NADA will be increased  and sports­persons will also be  empowered against doping.

With this bill, the  system of sports in the country will become stricter and stronger, from which it  is not going to be easy for the athletes to escape. The aim of this Bill is to give  legal form to the operation of the National Anti­Doping Agency and its related  testing laboratories. The bill, inter alia, seeks to establish a national board for  anti­doping work in sports. With this, the work of making sports dope free in  India is being done by the Government, which is a welcome step. Due to lack of  law against doping in the country, the cases were reaching the court of law after  hearing in NADA. After the enactment of this law, the decisions of the NADA  hearing panel will not be challenged in the court. I have some suggestions. In  case an athlete does not follow a strict anti­doping law, the athlete as well as the  federation and the coach concerned should be held responsible. Players need to  be trained to strictly follow anti­doping laws. Dieticians should keep an eye on  the prescribed diet and there is also a need to test the food of the players. There  is a need to start more dope testing laboratories in the country. The  Parliamentary Standing Committee has also said in its suggestion that there  should be a laboratory in every state. My request to the Minister is to start a  laboratory in Mumbai, which will also meet the needs of the country and in  addition, India will become a leading country in Southeast Asia in the field of  anti­doping science and education.

212,SHRI BHARTRUHARI MAHTAB,"It has taken 20 years to frame this Bill  and bring it to the Parliament. The existing anti­doping rules were adopted by  NADA verbatim without taking into consideration the realities on the ground in  India. The Bill formulates these rules into a legislative framework. This  framework is welcome and crucial in the contemporary situation to protect the  athletes’ rights and regulate them. However, the Bill empowers the agencies to  act on their own belief to suspect any athlete. This creates an unreasonable  arbitrary authority in the hands of agency members to undertake to enter athlete  premises, seize any equipment, device or substance. The Bill does not provide  any clarity on the protection of the data they procure from the testing or  investigating the athlete. Also the personal data protection is missing and that is  one of the major reasons why one feels that this Bill has overlooked that issue.  Many of our sportspersons come from backward regions and they inadvertently  fall victims to doping which needs to be checked. One Hon’ble Member  mentioned about the Standing Committee Reports. I would say that certain  things are still lacking. The Committee also noted that the Bill does not make  any distinction between minor and major athletes and it should therefore be  made in the Rules to ensure the protective mechanism for minor athletes. The  Committee recommended that since an athlete’s sporting career is limited, there  is a need to ensure that the quantum of penalties is proportional to the degree of  the violation. Since this is a policy decision, the Government has to take note of  this and can examine this issue. The qualification of the Director General is not  specified. Leaving these provisions to the discretion of the Central Government  may affect the independence of the Director General. My second point is, under  the Bill the Board has powers to remove the members of the Disciplinary Panel  and Appeal Panel on grounds which are not specified in the Bill. The  Disciplinary Panel will consist of one Chairperson, four Vice­Chairperson, and  ten members. But it is not clear who among the four Vice­chairpersons will be  responsible for forming the hearing panel in the absence of the Chairperson and  who will make that selection. I would say that when an athlete decides to use  illegal substances, he or she is not necessarily acting alone. Coaches are under  pressure to produce high results. Younger athletes find it difficult to resist it.  But the athletes are the ones who are punished and the coaches will go scot free.  Therefore, some provisions in the rules can be made in this regard. I support this  Bill.","Wednesday, July 27, 2022",Union Budget,M,BJD,Call For Action

The Government should make an independent  officer the Director General and put the condition that after being appointed to  this post, one does not have to accept any other post. Laboratories, scientists,  equipment and doctors, all these should be well­equipped and as per NADA  standards. If this does not happen, then as NADA has been suspended many  times, in the same way, it will continue to be suspended again and again. I  would like to request the hon.

232,SHRI HANUMAN BENIWAL,"The House is discussing the Family  Courts Bill, 2022 today. The State from which I come, Rajasthan, unfortunately,  is among the top states having the highest number of cases of women atrocities  and harassment of women. Nowadays, a large number of cases are being filed  there. In the year 1984, the Family Courts Act was brought in the Parliament by  the Government of India and through this Act, a separate court was created to  settle family disputes. I would like to ask the Hon’ble Minister whether people  are getting timely justice in the family courts since 1984 or not? I would also  like to ask whether the Government has reviewed the situation in this regard  because after bringing this Bill, there must have been many challenges and  suggestions for a long time. I would also like to know about the steps taken by  the Government for comprehensive reforms, which will be beneficial for the  victims in the Family Court. The rising number of pending cases in various  Family Courts in the country is alarming. The Government also needs to think  about this as more than 11 lakh cases are pending in various Family Courts.  There are many reasons for family disputes and according to the study of  experts the whole world's inclination towards materialism is also one of the  reasons for this. In such a situation, there is a need to take effective steps to  resolve the cases, which come up in the family courts, through counselling in  the first stage itself. In this regard marriage counsellors have an important role  to play. Marriage counsellors are changed every 3 months. Thus, if the case  lasts for more than 3 months, the woman or the victim has to adjust with the  new counsellors and repeat her statement several times. So, I had some  suggestions in this regard. The existing authorities, legal branches, etc. should  be brought under one roof to prevent domestic violence including setting up one    stop centre. A common tracking system should be developed for the police,  court and victims so that they can get justice. The number of counsellors and  psychologists in Family Courts should also be increased.","Tuesday, July 26, 2022",Union Budget,M,RLP,Issue

After today’s amendments, such family courts and  their verdict will be validated. This law relates to marriage and family affairs  and was meant to encourage reconciliation and settlement of such issues. There  is a long pendency of such cases in the courts for years together. The  Government should ponder over this issue early. A family court should be set  up in every district for a population of about 10 lakh under this law. However,  there are many districts in Bihar and other states where the population exceeds  even 20 lakh. I would request the Government to set up the court early.

235,SHRI RITESH PANDEY,"When a law relating to the Family Court  comes into force, the Union government has the power to decide the date from  which that law will come into force in any state. In Nagaland and Himachal  Pradesh, the Act was yet to be implemented. This Bill has been brought in to  implement the policy decisions taken earlier with retrospective effect. But it was  a very golden opportunity to give a good direction to this country by changing  the three major points in this Bill. The first thing is that there is a skewed gender  ratio in the judiciary. Despite the fact that women should be given priority in the  appointment of judges in the family courts under the same Bill, the situation  today is that there are only less than 20 per cent women in the chair of judges in  the Indian Family Courts. In some High Courts, there is not a single woman  judge. Out of 33 judges in the apex Supreme Court, only there are four women  judges.  There was an opportunity in this Bill to make an amendment in it and  give more empowerment to women, so that they have an equal share in the  Family Courts. My second point is that there is a great need to set up a family  court bench in the appeal courts. When there is contempt of any order of the  court, no one takes it seriously. The third thing is that the tenure of marriage  counsellors has been fixed at three months and it should be increased. Marriage  counsellors are engaged with the victim for three months, so that they  understand the problems and help them. But what happens is that if a case goes  beyond three months, that counsellor is changed. The victim has to tell their  story again, it also takes time to understand the problem. I want to appeal  through you that women should be provided reservation in the Family Courts  because it is a matter of their future and the maximum number of victims here  are women.","Tuesday, July 26, 2022",Union Budget,M,BSP,Call For Action

The first point  I wish to make is that the Government should constitute a Committee, the way  we had done to repeal redundant and obsolete laws; and let this Committee  scrutinise all the existing laws and recommend corrective measures to the  administrative Ministries, wherever required. The Family Courts system in the  country is not quite in the pink of health. One of the reasons behind this is the  lack of infrastructure and shortage of judges and judicial officers at the lower  level. I have a few very quick suggestions which I would like to make for better  management, functioning, and delivery of justice in Family Courts. Family  Courts can take the help of NGOs in settlement of disputes. Counsellors should  be appointed on a permanent basis and they should be given proper training.  Judges in Family Courts need to be gender sensitized. Procedure in Family  Courts should be simplified to pave speedy and hassle­free justice. The  Government may give a thought of appointing qualified social workers and  activists as judges of Family Courts.

237,DR. RAJDEEP ROY,"The Indian Judiciary probably has the largest  backlog of pending cases in the whole world. This is not a problem of the  system.  It is primarily because of the size of population that we have.  The  number of marriages is also exceedingly high, and it is probably the highest in  the world. As per the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG), there are around 4.7  crore cases which are pending before the courts. Out of this, 11.75 lakh cases  are pending in the Family Courts. The regular courts are basically burdened  with civil and criminal matters, and little or no attention is given to family  matters.  But things are changing because judicial reforms are being looked into  by this Government since 2014. The  Law  Commission  suggested  the  establishment of Family Courts for early disposal and settlement of family  matters.  Based on the suggestions of the Law Commission and basically to  decongest those trial courts, the Parliament passed the Family Courts Act in    1984, and the edifice of this Act was built on two strong pillars, the first pillar  being to promote conciliation and the second pillar being the speedy settlement  of the marriages disputes which are basically brought in front of the Family  Courts. The present amendment of 2022 is necessitated by the case of Onkar  Sharma versus the State of Himachal Pradesh which has already been discussed.  Now, it is important to mention here that the verdict delivered by those courts,  especially Nagaland in 2008 and Himachal Pradesh in 2019, needs to be  validated by an Act of law which has to be passed from here. This Government  has identified the problem. The first step towards a solution is the identification  of the problem. Family Courts are a step in the right direction.

The Resolution requires all States  to adopt and enforce appropriate laws to this effect as well as other effective measures to  prevent the proliferation of these weapons and their means of delivery to actors, in  particular for terrorist purposes.  Nonetheless, detecting proliferation-relevant illicit  financing is even harder than detecting money laundering or terrorism financing.  The  risks posed by Weapons of Mass destruction stem not only from ready-made bombs,  nuclear, chemical or radiological material but also from dual-use goods and technology  that are traded, shipped and used globally.  One of the most important areas for the  Government to work upon is on informing the private sector promptly to match changes  in UN designations of entities and individuals.  If the UN Security Council designated  new entities or individuals as proliferators, but a given country failed to update its lists,  what happens is that these financial institutions continue to trade with these entities  because they are not made aware of these changes in time.

The time has come  where we need to move closer to the US and the QUAD Summit in May this year is one  such opportunity for India. we have been adopting a non-aligned approach. We have  taken sides or worked closely with world powers only when national interest is involved.   in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, I do not see any national interest involved. I  have a few economic bullet points. More than 500 million dollars‟ worth of exporters  payments are stuck in Russia due to sanctions. Ukraine is the third largest producer and  exporter of maize and Ukraine and Russia are also top two exporters of sunflower oil  which we import. Russia is also the world‟s second largest exporter of muriate of potash  fertilizer which we import. Out of 5.09 metric tonnes that we import, one-third come  from Belarus and Russia. Ukraine is the third largest supplier of urea to India. We are  also importing crude oil from Russia, Exports from India like medicines, tea, etc. to  Russia are impacted due to shipment concerns and there is also shortage of containers. A  carefully calibrated stand by New Delhi has created a distinctive space for diplomacy by  not only maintaining equi-distance between the two powers but also moving towards a  multipolar world.","Tuesday, April 5, 2022",Union Budget,M,TDP,Neutral

Although our Constitution has provisions for  reservation for these socially deprived people, they have benefited from reservation only  in a limited manner. But we need to put in efforts to make these people become a part of  mainstream society. The Bill seeks to remove Bhogta community from the list of  Scheduled Castes and include it in the Scheduled Tribes list along with other  communities . Inclusion of more castes and making laws are not enough. More funds are  required to be allocated. Most importantly, implementation is to be looked after.  Numerous innocent Adivasis have lost their lives by being mistaken as Maoists. The hon.  Minister must look into the matter of the undertrials and their current situation. The  tribals have witnessed continued encroachment upon their resources both at individual  and community level. This needs to be stopped immediately and the lands that were taken  away from them should be handed over to the original landholders. Finally, I would like  to mention here that under the leadership of our hon. Chief Minister, the Government of  West Bengal has largely been successful in abolishing Maoist activities by implementing  several developmental projects. Women from Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe  communities are receiving Rs. 1000 per month under the „Lakshmi Bhandar‟ scheme. It  is a symbol of women empowerment.

Therefore, the faith of the common people in the judicial system is getting undermined.  People say that the police personnel do not conduct scientific investigation. This Bill has  been brought in to make that very scientific investigation possible. The 87th report of the  Law Commission of India reveals that the criminal justice system of the country is very  colonial and heavily tilted in favour of criminal.

It wants to create databases of  citizens but does not want to provide any safeguards. NCRB is being empowered to  maintain a database of measurements collected under this Bill. NCRB is not a statutory  body. How can legislation empower a Board that has no statutory existence itself?  Secondly, under section 4, no parameters have been provided on who has the power to  access this data, what police officer of what rank? Improper recording or handling of the  data in database is a serious concern. What are the safeguards against malicious misuse or  distortion of data? Interlinking databases is a huge violation of citizens' Right to Privacy  as it allows the Government to identify citizens even for purposes other than crime  detection. This Bill is unbridled power in the hands of Government and police.  Preventive detention suspects and arrestees are not criminals. There is a presumption of  innocence.

369,SHRI BRIJENDRA SINGH,"When I read this particular Bill and the provisions  therein, I have to confess that it was a case of „better late than never‟.  The Law  Commission had recommended widespread changes.  Many States tried to bring about  piecemeal changes or amendments to the Identification of Prisoners Act of 1920.  These  States include, West Bengal, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.  The last  case was of Karnataka in 2021, when they sought to expand the definition of  „measurement‟ and to include DNA voice, and iris scans.  However, the Bill was reserved  by the Governor for the consideration of the hon. President of India because it was felt  that the Bill was repugnant with the Act of 1920.  A 1920 Act which provides for only  fingerprints, footprints and photographs is not the way to deal with crime and criminals  of the 21st century.  We cannot expect our police to be equipped with tools of early 20th  century to deal with crimes and criminals of the 21st century. The modern techniques and  the modern technology greatly facilitate and enhance the quality and quantity of criminal  investigation.  I would like to conclude by saying that no society is perfect, nor is ours.   There are deeply held biases and prejudices embedded in our social consciousness.  Our  police is a product of its social milieu and as such is far from being perfect.  However,  that does not mean that we do not empower it with requisite powers and instruments.   There is an undeniable need to strike a balance between protecting an individual‟s  privacy and giving the police the tools, they need to keep us safe.","Monday, April 4, 2022",Union Budget,M,BJP,Appreciate

Allocation of more funds, implementation and real change through education  are the need of the hour.  Chapter on inclusivity and equality must be included in school  curriculum to build a better generation, and thus their future.  The Gond community will  be excluded from the Scheduled Castes list, and included in the Scheduled Tribes list.

But, bodybuilders do not receive any kind of assistance from the  Government.  So, it is my earnest request to the Government that financial assistance may  be extended to our bodybuilders too.  Similarly, due to the lack of proper rules and  standards laid down by the Government, anabolic steroids have found their way to the  youth of India.  Unregulated gyms also perpetrate the induction of youth in steroid type  drugs.  So, not regularizing it and not setting forth the correct standards and requirements  can have the adverse effects on budding sportsperson.

There is some more way for our States to improve our  infrastructure, it is good. Indian cricket is discussed almost like you discuss politics on  every dining table.

So, the  Government does not necessarily have to interfere but if you can complement each other,  it is overall good for the sports sector. There are two sports, outside of Khelo India, that  we need to promote. One is traditional sports and the other is adventure sports. Adventure  sports is a very big business in tourism.

Such problems are limited not  only to specific districts or states or even one country. The effects of climate change have  rocked the whole world. The latest IPCC report brings out some startling information on  effects of climate change in the south Asian region. The report clearly says that India  would have to face irreversible impacts of climate change. The report also notes that the  Indian Ocean including the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal, has warmed faster than the  global average. As per IPCC Report, by the end of the century, 12 cities including  Vishakhapatnam, Mumbai and Chennai could be nearly three feet under water.  Rayalseema region of Andhra, comprising Anantapur, Kurnool, Chittoor and YSR  Kadapa districts has felt the impact of climate change. For instance, if we take the example of Anantapur district alone, in the last 30 years, the cultivated area in the district  has dropped by 50%, from 30 lakh acres to roughly 15 lakh acres. Small-scale fishing  communities are already facing several challenges. Changing sea temperature especially  in the Bay of Bengal region, has caused several fish varieties to migrate to relatively  cooler places.

Carbon emission in  Delhi is so much that the whole city has become a gas chamber and an important  suggestion has been given to plant more of Peepal and Neem trees in place of Kikar trees  in the ridge area of Delhi to reduce carbon emission. It is not appropriate to blame the  farmer only for carbon emission. Ofcourse, carbon emission takes place through burning  of stubble and crops residue by farmers but carbon is emitted more in the name of  urbanisation and by airconditioned machinery and in larger quantity by big and small  vehicles in the cities. The laws in this country have to pass through two types of norms.  One for rich and one for poor. The manner in which the climate change has started  changing the geographical situation, the day is not far when there would be an outcry for  living all over if no timely attention has been paid in this regard.

406,SHRI JAYADEV GALLA,"My first point is regarding rising number of natural  disasters in the country. The rising temperature can be co-related to the increasing  number of natural calamities in the country. According to research , India’s Green House  gas emissions were about 3.3 Giga tonnes in 2018 and projected to rise above 4 Giga  tones per year by 2030. With this rate of emission, India should look to cut at least 3 to 4  per cent of its absolute emission rate per year to achieve its climate targets. In the  recently held COP26 summit at Glasgow, India has committed to achieve net zero  emission by 2070 and hon. PM announced Panchamrit at COP26. India will achieve Net  Zero Emission by 2070 and non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030. It will bring  its economy’s carbon intensity down to 45% by 2030 and fulfill 50% of its energy  requirement through renewable energy by 2030. Moreover, it will reduce 1 billion tonnes  of carbon emissions from the total projected emissions by 2030. I would like to talk about  the concept of Zoonotic diseases. It is a diseases that is passed into the human population  from an animal source directly or through an intermediary species. A UN report has  indicated that 75% of emerging infectious diseases are Zoonotic in nature. As per ILO  projections based on a global temperature rise of 1.5°C by the end of twenty-first century  suggests that, in 2030, 2.2 per cent of total working hours worldwide will be lost to high  temperatures. The economic losses due to heat stress at work were estimated at US$280  billion in 1995; this figure is projected to increase to US$2,400 billion in 2030.","Thursday, March 31, 2022",Union Budget,M,TDP,Issue

The move to reform the disciplinary mechanism of professionals is a part of effort to  improve corporate governance. The Chartered accountants play a key role in the  preparation and audit of financial statements. The Bill proposes a time-limit on resolving  the cases under investigation. While stronger penalties and punishments will act as a  deterrent, it may also dissuade Chartered Accountant professionals from joining together  to form bigger audit firms. The amendment makes it impossible for audit firms to escape  accountability for misdeeds by any of its partners. The Standing Committee has also  made some good suggestions. In India, the ICAI has the statutory monopoly power over  the whole profession.

The role of the  Head of Council and the Executive Head may be separated. I must say that it is important  to facilitate a business-friendly environment for corporate as well as professionals in  India.

Unfortunately, the Presidential Address was a long list of things that  the Government claims to have done but did not really contain the deeper strategic issues.   Also, the Presidential Address did not touch a couple of central challenges facing our  country.  Your government continuously attacked the unorganized sector and small and  medium enterprises during the last seven years. The support required during the Corona  crisis was not given. As a result 84 per cent people of India saw their income declined.  UPA government had alleviated poverty of 23 crore people in 10 years. It is a fact. Look  at any sector, we see two monopolists. This government has destroyed the whole small  and medium industry. There is 46 per cent drop in manufacturing jobs in India. It is  because that the government has destroyed unorganized sector. Today, top hundred  richest persons of India have more assets than that possessed by 55 crore Indians. It is  because of this government. Their leadership have no idea of history. Our country is like  a bouquet of flowers. This is our strength. What is happening as a result of their flawed  vision of the country? Two Indias are being created. No power in the world has ever been  able to challenge this bouquet of flowers. There is another vision- a centralising vision,  the vision of a king. That idea of a king has come back.

I would like to thank the  Government for facilitating an inclusive and broad-based recovery by keeping a strong  focus on the capital expenditure and infrastructure and connectivity projects. My State  Andhra Pradesh was unscientifically bifurcated in 2014. The mandated projects are  moving at a slow pace. At the time of bifurcation, the State of Andhra Pradesh was left  with a revenue deficit of Rs. 22,000 crore. The Government had promised to compensate  the revenue deficit but only Rs. 4,000 crore has been given to the State. I would request  the Government to give the balance of Rs. 18,000 crore to my state. We are requesting  the Government of India for the timely release of the funds for the Palavaram project and  other projects in the State of Andhra Pradesh. Rs. 1 lakh crore of funds are being given to  the States for capital expenditure. We hope to get the Centre‟s approval and also the  financial support to establish the semiconductor  and electronic equipment manufacturing  zone at Mannavaram. The Government of India should drop the decision of disinvesting  the Vizag Steel Plant. I would urge the Minister of Road Transport and Highways to  consider and expedite the work of Vizag-Chennai Industrial Corridor. Besides,The  Polavaram Project Authority should be shifted to Rajahmundry. From the Presidential  Address, we can sense the commitment of the Modi Government for the well-being of  farmers‟ and women. The PM Kisan Samman Nidhi is giving Rs. 6,000.

Maharashtra government proposed four government colleges and  also proposed Sindhudurg government medical college in my area. But after giving  approval to Sindhudurg Government Medical College, it was disapproved. The  Maharashtra government has given 50 thousand rupees to the families of those who have  died due to corona, but how many such families of the country have been given financial  assistance by the central government? I want complete information in this regard. If not  given, arrangements should be made to provide that assistance. The state government has  issued an ordinance for OBC. The question of OBC is there in the whole country.The  Central Government had given a relief package to improve the financial health of the  private telecom company of the country. BSNL is a public sector telecom company in the  country. BSNL should be strengthened. Maharashtra's 30 thousand crore rupees GST has  not been given till date. According to the GST law, about three and a half thousand crore  rupees have not been given to the corporations in the metropolitan city for the last three  years. Out of the revenue being collected in this country, about 40 percent of the revenue  is coming only from Mumbai and Maharashtra state.

About 6.5 crore people have been  pushed below the poverty line, 54 percent of the people have lost their income and more  than 60 lakh small industries have been locked down. We have to think seriously about  this section of people. There are plans for the poor, but the middle class people of the  country are not thought about. We have to think seriously about this. Along with this, the  second indirect result is the educational effect. It is as if two years of education and  development have disappeared from the lives of children due to the Corona period. We  also have to think about the children who are being deprived of this education due to the  digital divide in the country. Today 5 crore youth are unemployed in the country, that is  why alternatives like strengthening of MNREGA and urban Version of MNREGA should  be considered. Our country has slipped to 142nd position out of 180 countries in the  World Press Freedom Index. In the year 2020, 67 journalists have been arrested and 200  journalists have been attacked. The number of journalists who have lost their jobs is  separate. A very ambitious project of MRIDC in Maharashtra is Pune-Nashik Semi High  Speed Railway which has been approved by Maharashtra Government.

At the time, our Prime Minister had called on the people of entire country to make India  self -reliant. While we were importing PPE kits from abroad once, today we have  supplied Corona vaccines to 180 countries. In this way, this government has not only  saved the people of our country but also saved the people of different countries of the  world from COVID-19. Besides, our government has also saved the economy for the  country in these difficult times. Today, the growth rate of India has been projected at  9.6%. The capital expenditure has grown by 13.5% expenditure which has been used in  constructing highways, railways and international airports and also for providing  connectivity in the country. We have also made 8.6% expenditure in the social sector  which was 6.2% in the year 2014. In 1947 when our country became independent, 18,000  villages of our country were devoid of electricity. Our government has provided  electricity to these 18,000 villages. This government has provided electricity to 4.5 crore  households in the country under Saubhagya Yojna.

Both the boards were of the opinion that they were not in the position to buy more than  17-18 planes. But what we did?

We lost around Rs. 30-35 thousand crore in corruption in  the name of turn around plan. Second issue is that of fertilizer subsidy and that is very  important. Today the rate DAP has increased in the world market. We don’t have raw  material for Nitrate, Phosphate and the prices are rising in the world.

I  also urge upon the Finance Minister to stress on the due of Rs. 4,943 crore of GST  pending for the States. The States are losing their share with the new GST formula. In the  second batch of Demands for Supplementary Grants, nearly Rs. 3.73 lakh crore has been  sought by the Finance Minister. I urge upon the Finance Minister to increase the funds in  MPLAD. Similarly, out of Rs. 73 lakh crores, the Finance Minister has requested for Rs.  22,000 crores for MGNREGA. We know that because of the long pending COVID-19  impact, unemployment rate has increased. Several young people have become jobless. I  am sure that the Finance Minister would take more efforts in this regard in the coming  Budget and would address this issue much more wisely. One wonders at the commitment  made to TATAs that Air India will be handed over debt free. We do not know who the  second bidder is or who the third bidder is. It is as secret as the PM CARES fund. The  Government of India is giving Rs. 68,000 crores to wipe off all the debt. In seven and  half years the Government could not turn a company around or you made it worse. It is a  question. No one stays in the Government permanently. At a time, a gas cylinder was  costing Rs. 490, while today, a domestic gas cylinder costs Rs. 915. The Minister of State  for Finance has stated that the collection from the levy of Central Excise Duty on petrol  and diesel has increased. I am not asking, the common man is asking as to why can you  not reduce the prices? A major fraud is happening in the disguise of the IBC. When a  farmer takes a loan, he does not get a haircut of 95 per cent, not even 10 per cent. When  parents take education loan for their children, they do not get any haircuts. The banks do  not write off their loans. The very idea is to save the company, but you are killing our  public banks.

There has been a substantial increase in  receipts of the Government during 2021-22 but in devolution to the States, something is  lacking there. Normal Central assistance has been abolished and a steep increase in  State’s share in Centrally Sponsored schemes has been effected. This has imposed severe  financial burden on the States. My State Odisha has also suffered due to this. The States  should have a greater say planning, designing, and finalising of criteria for allocation for  Centrally Sponsored Schemes. There is a need to make a big push for public investment  on infrastructure. India has been brandishing its credentials as a super power in the  making for the last several decades but the Indian economy has been refusing to  unshackle itself. No doubt the Income Tax Rules have, over time, become less ambiguous  and more transparent and the procedure simpler. However, as far as taxing interest  income is concerned, two ambiguities still remain. First, the interest earned in a financial  year, apart from being taxed in that year, is added to the account holder’s deposit under  compound interest rate regime and becomes again liable for taxation in the subsequent  years. This needs to be changed. Secondly, the interest earned is taken for taxation on  accrual basis, not on realisation basis. This needs to be addressed.

The element of confidence, reflected by the Budget, is that the economy will  revive and reset. The Supplementary Demands for Grants reflects the spirit of the hon.

While on one hand, the government has devastated the rural economy by  shifting its focus to unicorns, whereas demonetisation and poor implementation of GST  and the COVID pandemic have decimated the country's small and medium scale  industries. Here small and medium industries were the largest employers of our country.  More than 70 percent of the total population of the country lives in rural areas and these  70 percent people contribute 46 percent of the country's income. Today people in rural  areas are plagued by inflation and the entire economy has been destroyed. Even when the  outbreak of the pandemic and recession was widespread in rural areas, this Government  only increased the allocation of MGNREGA by 1.8 per cent. The allocation made for  MGNREGA this year is less than the actual allocation for the year 2015-2016. In the  wake of COVID, the government should bring some policy for the education system  soon, otherwise, students’ entire one-year education tenure will turn into complete  darkness. There has been no job creation in India in the last seven years. This government  works to make favourable policies for the few capitalist people. I would definitely like to  say that policies are being made only for those sectors, which do not generate  employment.

The  question is, can a substantive sentencing provision in criminal law be given retrospective  effect by a legislative declaration.  Unfortunately this Bill does not address this question.  If this Bill is accepted in the form in which the Government has proposed it, this would  mean that Article 20 of the Constitution of India will become redundant and we are going  to open the floodgates of misuse. If at any point of time in the future, any law can be  brought and can be given effect retrospectively, then no person in this country can ever  be safe. It has implications on the confidence which people have in our supreme  legislative institutions. This Amendment Act talks about imprisonment from ten years to  life and it is a substantive sentencing provision. How will any court allow it to have  retrospective effect? Even in case of tax and tax legislations taxes can be collected with  retrospective effect but penal provisions cannot be applied retrospectively. I think that  this amendment is not likely to pass judicial scrutiny. It will be better if it comes into  force from the date on which this law gets notified.  Synthetic drugs are being  manufactured in legitimate pharmaceutical factories.  That is something which the  Government has been completely unable to come to grips with.

The youngsters nowadays are getting carried away with narcotic  and  psychotropic substances. Under this Act, we have 238 drugs. I would request the  Government to see whether these 238 drugs are actually being abused and whether this  list can be shortened. Today drug abuse has pervaded into schools, forget about colleges  and other walks of life.  Today, school children have access to these kinds of contraband,  and it is the duty of the Government to ensure that the sale of these drugs should be  curtailed.  Cigarette and alcohol are the two biggest threats and the biggest problems in  this country. Smoking has one of the biggest health hazards which causes a lot of  respiratory problems and also cancer. But we do not talk about smoking and alcohol. One  of the biggest psychotropic substances which causes most of the social evils is alcohol. I  have seen families who are suffering due to alcohol because the men die at a young age  leaving their families destitute. So, when we have these kinds of issues before us, why are  we talking so much about these drugs? We are not even taking adequate action against  those people who are selling or trafficking such drugs. We are only targeting the people  who are found in the possession of such drugs and that too, a small quantity. To say that a  person who is in possession of a small quantity of a drug will be penalised and will be  sentenced to six months of jail, is unacceptable. I feel that we should give them adequate  protection. Even the Government probably should take steps to ensure that rehabilitation  is provided to these people. I would like to request the Government to take adequate steps  to ensure that Ordinances of this nature are not promulgated.

536,SHRI KALYAN BANERJEE,"In a catena of judgments, the hon. Supreme  Court has said that in civil cases, excepting taxing statute, no provision can be given a  retrospective effect. Despite that, it has been brought in. When a person is arrested with  contraband involving commercial quantity according to the provision of Section 37 of the  NDPS Act, no court shall grant bail unless satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for  believing that he is not guilty of such an offence. The offences relating to narcotics and  drugs, all over the world, are considered to be more serious. Many a time, persons are  booked and arrested merely on the alleged statement of the principal accused although  either from search of their person or their place of residence, no drug or psychotropic  substance is seized. The concept of presumption of culpable mental state as envisaged in  Section 35 of NDPS Act is also draconian. The burden of proof is on accused to prove  that he did not have the requisite culpable mental state. The said Section 35 read with 37  makes it extremely difficult for a person to be released on bail. No getting a bail itself is a  violation of Article 21. While speaking on the provisions of this Bill, I would like to  request the hon. Minister to re-visit the provisions that I mentioned earlier.

The High Court ruling further ordered  that both the Central Government and the the State Government shall publish a  notification bringing about the content of this order, in short, for the public notice so that  the requirement of Article 20 of the Constitution of India is not diminished.

The shutdown of  the economy sent lakhs of workers on the long walk home and many  perished. The incomes of silent classes saw deep cuts and a lot people lost  their jobs. More than 30 per cent of our MSMEs have reportedly been closed  down permanently. In such grim circumstances, the nation was waiting for a  revival package. It is an unprecedented let-down Budget. The common man is  left with nothing but empty words and unfulfilled promises.  There is no  income tax concession. In this Budget, there is not a single good news to the  middle-class. Construction, aviation, tourism and hospitality industries have  been adversely affected. The Government should reduce the rates of GST.  On the contrary, they hiked the excise duty on petrol. We are worried that in  the wake of tension with China, the figures on defence spending barely show  any change. The Budget allocation for the Department of Agriculture and  Farmer Welfare has been slashed by 8.5 per cent in 2021-22. The farmers  are agitating for about 90 days but the Government has shown no  compassion towards them. The Government has touted the health  expenditure set out in the Budget as the game changer but technically the  funds allocated to the health sector are lesser than what was allocated  previous year. When you are focusing so much on the Corona pandemic  vaccine please ensure that the regular programmes do not get a backseat.  There is a discomfort as people are not truly trusting the vaccine. I am saying  this with no political agenda but I really want the people of our country to be  protected. The PSUs have failed miserably. Now, the Government is in a  spree to sell our PSUs. Why cannot you cut down on your advertisement?  You are spending crores and crores of money to keep the media shut. Why  cannot you put that money into our PSUs? Please look at BSNL. Should the  Prime Minister not take the lead and ensure to be a poster boy for BSNL? LIC  is the only Government-owned life insurance company and you plan to sell it  off and fund the Government. You said that Air India is in very bad shape. No  private airlines came forward to bring Indians from abroad. Our Prime  Minister, last year, said that in a country of 130 crore, only 1.5 crore people  are paying taxes, that is nearly one per cent. Let me tell you that may be one  per cent is paying taxes, but 99 per cent are also paying taxes, indirect taxes.  The banking system is digitalised. The Government has not done anything for  better service for public. This Budget has not addressed the serious question  of job creation. While millions of Indians lost jobs or sunk into poverty, the  fortunes of the country‟s two richest people are increasing day to day. The  Finance Minister has made some announcement for Tamil Nadu after  neglecting Tamil Nadu for nearly eight years. AIIMS was supposed to come in  Madurai. Till now, there is not even a single stone put there. There is a long  pending demand for a train to Jodhpur, Rajasthan, from Central Chennai. I  would request the Railway Minister to look into it and do something about it.  ","Wednesday, February 10, 2021",Union Budget,M,DMK,Blame

As regards GST collections, Andhra Pradesh stands first  in the entire country during Covid-19 period also.  It stands second in  commerce and industry.  A lot of funds related to MGREGA are pending with  various Departments of the Central Government. I request the Government to  release the pending dues of Rs. 4282 crore to the Government of Andhra  Pradesh for rice distribution through the Public Distribution System and   provide  revenue deficit which has been caused by the 14th Finance  Commission which comes to Rs 18,830 crore.  Assistance for Nivar Cyclone  under NDRF and Development assistance to the backward districts should  also be provided.   I urge the Government to immediately accord special  category status to the State of Andhra Pradesh and accord sanction to  Ramayapatnam Port in place of Dugarajapatnam Port.  There is a need to  implement all schemes and projects under AP Reorganisation Act. I request  the Government to release all funds pending for the welfare schemes and  various projects pertaining to the state.  I request the hon. Finance Minister to  rethink, restructure and recalibrate Vizag Steel Project.  There is a need to  restructure mining sector in the state.   The tax slab of GST should be  reduced from 18% as it is very high and some kind of relief in regard to GST  has to be given to the contractors doing work for the State Government and  the Central Government.   The Government has to rethink on MSME sector  and provide stimulus package to them.  New railway lines, RUBs and ROBs  are required to be built in Andhra Pradesh with 100 percent support from the  Central Government. As far as individual income tax is concerned, some kind  of relief should be provided to middle class and upper middle class people.

Be  it Eklavya Vidyalaya or Ujjwala Yojana or expansion of the Indian Railways or  expansion of the National Highways, on all the fronts the government has  proved that by taking all together, we can ensure the development of all. The  Union Government has announced to set up New 69 New Eklavya Vidyalayas  in Jharkhand. This step would definitely help the children of the tribal families  to realize their dreams. By allocating Rs. 35 thousand crore for corona  vaccine, the Government has made it clear that it is very much concerned  about the healthcare  of the general public and is committed towards ensuring  the safety of its citizens from worldwide corona virus pandemic. Long term  projects proposed for the growth of railways in the budget would undoubtedly  accelerate the pace of development of the county.

I request the Government to invite them for talks.   Mumbai city had been textile hub and now it is on the verge of closure.  I  request the hon‟ble Minister of Finance to set up a Textile Park there.  There  is a big problem of Metro Car Shed in Mumbai and I request to set up the  same there.

While privatizing Airports,  LIC and port of Mumbai whether the Government has considered on its social  impact.  All employees of MTNL who have taken VRS have not got their dues  as yet.  Air India evacuated Indian citizens from abroad and repatriated them  under „Vande Bharat Mission‟ during pandemic and now the Government is  going to privatise it.  A regards fishery is concerned, worth 2000 crores of fish  is lying in Mumbai as it was  to be exported to China.  I can understand the  things in view of national interest but what is the solution of it.  The school  curricula under National Education Policy could be in any language but should  maintain uniformity.  It has been 60 years since Goa was liberated and the  Government has allocated 300 crores to the state but nothing has been given  to Maharashtra on 60 years of liberation.  The Centre still owes 25 thousand  crores of Maharashtra in GST compensation.  The farmers have suffered  huge losses due to heavy rainfall and cyclones.  The State has witnessed  drought but no official reached immediately there.  Indian billionaires  increased  their wealth during the lockdown while around 24 per cent of the  people in India were earning Rs.3000 a month.

The funds recommended in the Interim Report of  the 15th Finance Commission should be provided to the state of Bihar.   A  textile park should be set up in Bihar.  All the cities of Bihar should be  included in the City Gas Distribution Network.  The Government‟s plan to  disinvest Indian Companies should be reconsidered and all sick institutions  should be revived.  Fertilizer factory located at Barauni, Bihar and railway  factory at Dalmia Nagar of Rohtas should be made functional.   Instead of  assembling engine parts, all parts should be manufactured in Electric rail  engine factory located at Madhepura of Bihar. Chhapra‟s wheel factory should  also be commissioned.  The plan to transfer Jamalpur loco shed should be  discontinued. The railway factories of Mokama, Samastipur and Muzaffarpur  should be made functional.  All these schemes will help in the development of  Bihar.  The Government talks about doubling the income of the farmers.  Hence it should provide interest free loans to them for purchasing agricultural  implements and machinery.  The Government should help the farmers in  selling their crops at fixed MSP so that they may get fair price.  The  Government should waive off their earlier loans also. The Government should  make an announcement to provide uniform monthly pension of atleast Rs.  3000/- to older persons in the country irrespective of their class.  Fisheries  centres should be opened in Saharsa, Bihar where farming is not possible  due to flood waters of river Kosi.  We demand that a Sainik School should be  set up at Kosi sub-divisional Headquarter of Saharsa.   The number of cancer,  heart disease, kidney and liver patients is increasing day by day in Saharsa- Madhepura areas of Bihar.  The Government should also find out the reasons  for such increase in the number of cases.  A new AIIMS should be set up in  Saharsa.

592,SHRIMATI SUPRIYA SADANAND SULE,"Sir, I stand here to speak  on the Budget. COVID really added to all the bad policies which were taken  by this Government. I would like to just highlight, and just take two minutes  about the U-turns of this Government. GST, Right to Education, NREGA,  Aadhar, were initiated by the previous government. During the COVID time,  everybody who lost their jobs in the city went back to their villages and the  only saviour there was MGNREGA and that is how thousands and thousands  of families have survived. The hon. Prime Minister talked about „intent versus  content‟. Everybody has a good intent. Why is the Government running away  from Committees? Committees are very good institutions. A good feedback is  taken. The Government should open his arms, call the farmers and resolve  the issue. If the Government really wants to work around the farmers, let us  stop this conflict because any aberration like this is not helping any of us.  There are two points that I need to bring to the notice of this Government. The  Government is talking about the GST compensation. The GST compensation  that the Central Government owes us, is Rs.26,597 crore. If you give us that  money, we will be happy to give free vaccine. The Finance Minister of India  has taken twelve crores from every MP without even asking us. On the other  hand, the Finance Minister of Maharashtra has made sure that every MLA,  from all the four Parties, including from the Opposition, gets Rs. 5 crore every  year without cut. The other thing is with regard to the FRBM Act. Now, the  FRBM Act is something of really a concern for us. You have to very urgently  bring this Act because we cannot borrow. Another u-turn of this Government  is the PMC Bank issue. Now, I come to the non-performing assets and jobs.  Now, I come to MUDRA loans. There is so much of mixed reactions. I really  do not know what truth the Government is saying. Non-utilisation of cess  revenue is another way to ill-treat the States. You collect all the cess. Nothing  comes to us. Now, there is a new agriculture cess. The CAG Report said that  whatever monies have come - have either not fully been transferred to the  dedicated fund or remains unutilized. So, I think you owe it to the States. In  your Government, New Education Policy emphasises on doubling the  Government‟s expenditure for education. You have reduced it. One last point,  I want to bring to the notice of this Government is about the NBFCs. There is  no regulation for this NBFCs. I do understand the Finance Minister has had  her own challenges with COVID.

By virtue of the Indian  model of handling COVID-19, the lowest fatality rate of 1.4 per cent in the  country has been possible.  India is one of the few countries that have  indigenously developed and manufactured COVID-19 vaccine.  We have  distributed and supplied vaccines to 15 countries.

We ensured  100 per cent electrification of India‟s villages. We opened bank accounts of  41.75 crore poorest of the poor Indians through the PM Jan Dhan Yojana.   We have sanctioned 2.11 lakh kilometers of road connectivity for villages  under the Prime Minister Gram Sadak Yojana since 2014.  We gave  assistance of Rs. 6,000 crore to 11.58 crore farmers under the PM Kisan  Samman Nidhi.  We gave insurance under the Fasal Bima Yojana to 8.85  crore farmers of this country.

Not a single rupee has been allocated till date for the cleaning  of two rivers from your side.  Less than 50 per cent work has been carried out  under MNREGA and Pradhan Mantri Gramin Awas Yojana.

Mostly children of the farmers are deployed at the  borders, whom you have left in bad state in such a shivering cold condition.  There is nothing for farmers, officers and labourers in the budget. You have  given nothing to. You have given nothing to anyone in this budget. In this  tough time you are spending thousand crores on construction of the New  Parliament. You have deducted salaries of officials and those of ours. You  have deducted arrears of officials. Had you given time of a week or ten days  to the labourers trapped  in different parts of the country when trains and  buses were operating, they would have reached home. You have not come up  with the law on minimum support price. You are going to sell BPCL, Shipping  Corporation, Containers Corporation, IDBI Bank, Pawanhans, Neelanchal  Ispaat and BEML. You are also going to sell Air India, though it is a different  thing that there are no buyers for them. Operation of several trains in my area  has been stopped.

Prime Minister  had said that this is a Government dedicated to the poor and therefore, the  Government had started Jan Dhan accounts in the country. The Opposition  ruled for the 70 years but the poor were not able to enter the banks. In the  initial stages of Corona pandemic, there were no PPE kits, no ventilators in  the country but this Government enabled the people to fight Corona virus by  getting ventilators and PPE kits manufactured just within two months.  Rs.500  each were credited to the accounts of poor people during that time to support  their livelihood. All should remain happy, all should remain healthy – this is the  culture of India. Our hon. Prime Minister considers the entire world as one  family. And that is why the Government is sending vaccine to a number of  countries in the world and has not kept it only limited for India. Some people  have lost their political ground and they are left with nothing. These are the  people who are now lamenting in the name of farmers. I would like to ask the  Congress party that if they were so concerned about the poor farmers then  what happened to the Swaminathan Commission‟s report? What happened to  its recommendations? Since the BJP Government came into power under the  leadership of hon. Modiji, this legislation has been enacted after accepting  201 recommendations of the same Swaminathan Commission so that the  farmers‟ income is doubled. First of all „Fasal Bima Yojana‟ was brought under  which farmers were assured of crop insurance on payment of just 2 or 1.5 per  cent premium. The MSP of wheat was Rs. 1400 per quintal in 2013-14 which  was raised to Rs. 1975 per quintal in 2020-21. Similarly, MSP of paddy was  increased to Rs. 1868 from Rs. 1310 per quintal which is an increase of 43  per cent. The Government has set a target of providing 20 lakh solar pumps  under the Pradhan Mantri Kusum Yojana in which the farmers have to pay  only 10 per cent.

During lockdown workers have to  face the problem of livelihood. But our government provided free foodgrains to  them for a period of 8 months.  Several vaccines have been developed in the  country at a very low cost to check corona virus. Our government announced  biggest ever economic package to bring economy on the track.

616,SHRI ASHOK MAHADEORAO NETE,"I sincerely support hon.  President's address. It is reflected by the President's address that the Central  Government is taking the country on a new path of rapid economic  development in accordance with its promise of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'.  The poor, downtrodden, exploited, deprived, farmers, workers and youths of  the country are at the center of this inclusive economic development of the  Government. In the central leadership, the honorable Prime Minister Shri  Narendra Modi shows the determination of continuous progress of the  country. I welcome the statement of hon. President that decisions taken under  the leadership of our hon. Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, saved the lives  of millions of our countrymen, as a result of which, there is a rapid decline in  the number of new cases of coronavirus and at the same time there is a  significant increase in the number of recoveries. The Central Government also  took care to ensure that no poor person went hungry.. The Central  Government also launched the 'Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyan' in six states in  order to provide employment to the returnee migrant labourers in their  villages, during the pandemic. An amount of Rs 31,000 crore was directly  transferred to the Jan Dhan accounts of poor women. During this period, more  than 14 crore gas cylinders were given free of cost throughout the country to  poor women beneficiaries, under the Ujjwala scheme. It is a matter of pride  that today India is running the world's largest vaccination campaign. The  entire credit for this goes to the government under the central leadership of  our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. The poor are now able to avail the  benefits of healthcare facilities with ease. Today there are 562 medical  colleges in the country and in the last 6 years, there has been an increase of  over 50,000 seats at the under-graduate and postgraduate levels in medical  education. Now, widespread improvements are being brought in various  sources of irrigation for agriculture. The food grain availability in the country is  at a record high. The Parliament approved 3 important farm reform bills 7  months ago, namely, The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce  (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection)  Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, and the Essential  Commodities (Amendment) Bill. The benefits of these farm reforms, have  started reaching more than 10 crore small farmers instantly. The Central  Government is constantly trying to remove the confusion created in the  context of these laws. The central government has always respected freedom  of expression and holding of peaceful agitations in a democratic set up. The  recent acts of dishonouring the National Flag and showing disrespect to the  auspicious occasion of the Republic Day are unfortunate. In order to enhance  the profitability of agriculture, the Central Government is also placing  emphasis on creating modern agricultural infrastructure. The Central  Government has been working relentlessly for multi-faceted development of  villages. Under the SVAMITVA scheme, villagers are now acquiring legal  rights over their property. Under the 'Jal Jeevan Mission‟ water connection is  being provided on priority to brothers and sisters belonging to the Scheduled  Castes & Scheduled Tribes as well as other deprived sections of the society.  The Government has made commendable progress in expanding the network  of rural roads. Several steps have been taken to enhance the role of MSMEs  in the mission aimed at developing an Atmanirbhar Bharat. Keeping in mind  the health concerns of working women in rural areas of the country, the  Government is implementing the „Suvidha‟ scheme under which sanitary  napkins are made available at a nominal cost of Re 1. Keeping in mind the  global requirements and challenges of the 21st century, the Government has  announced the National Education Policy. I also welcome the statement of  hon. President where he said that following the mantra of Sabka Saath,  Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas‟, the Government is prioritizing the development  of all sectors and all sections of the society. It is a happy coincidence that the  construction of a new Parliament House has commenced as we are  approaching the 75th year of our independence. I welcome the statement of  His Excellency the President where he said that the country has also started  emerging from the economic setback suffered in the wake of the coronavirus  pandemic when the focus was primarily on saving the life of each Indian  citizen. I welcome the statement of His Excellency the President where he  said that the development oriented policy of the Government has also  received wholehearted support from the people of Jammu and Kashmir.  Construction of a grand Ram Mandir has commenced after the Supreme  Court judgment. India has moved up from 65 to 34 in the World Tourism Index  ranking. All these works done under the central leadership of Hon'ble Prime  Minister Shri Narendra Modi are welcome steps. More than 21 crore poor  were linked to „Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana‟ for a premium of just  Rs. 1 a month. More than 3.5 crore children were vaccinated under „Mission  Indradhanush‟. 100 per cent digitisation of ration cards has been completed.  More than 8 crore gas connections were given free of cost under „Ujjwala  Yojana‟. More than 10 crore toilets were built under „Swachh Bharat Mission‟.  More than 41 crore Jan Dhan accounts were opened for the poor. In this way,  hon. President has not only cited the work done by the Government for the all- round development of the country during the last few years, but also  mentioned the priorities of the Central Government and the steps being taken  by the Government in its second term to steer out the country from global  epidemic crisis of Covid-19 and the steps taken in the meantime which clearly  shows a sense of self-image of our popular government.","Tuesday, February 9, 2021",Union Budget,M,BJP,Appreciate

Last  year, the world faced a major problem and challenge in the form of Corona  pandemic. It was challenging for all of us to take measures against Corona  due to the large population, diversity of cultural traditions as well as the  natural and geographical challenges of India. However, through strong  leadership and quick action taken in India, we have been able to control the  virus outbreak to an extent greater than many rich and developed countries of  the world.  India was not hugely affected despite the economic recession  happened caused by the Corona pandemic. Through the Pradhan Mantri  Garib Kalyan Yojana, financial assistance has been given to crores of  mothers and sisters and divyang brothers and sisters in the country. Last  year, three agricultural laws have been passed with a majority in both the  houses of the Parliament with an amendment to uplift the farmers and to  make them self-reliant under the leadership of hon. Modi ji. It is a  commendable step of the Government to implement almost all the  recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission made for agricultural  reforms.  In addition to providing "" Har Ghar Jal"" under ""Jal Jeevan Mission"",  water conservation is also being done . During the last 6 years, the  Government has built 6 lakh 42 thousand km roads under Pradhan Mantri  Gram Sadak Yojana and achieved a big goal to connect rural India by the  major roads of the country. The Government is also continuously working to  provide better internet and connectivity in the rural parts of the country. The  Government supports the small entrepreneurs of the country with commitment  to develop micro and small industries. The power to make India self-reliant is  in the hands of these small industries. The Government has sanctioned  National Education Policy-2020.

If it had been given to the farmers, they would not  have been here to besiege Delhi. I would like to ask the Government if the  farmers of Uttar Pradesh have been given the MSP? If the laws enacted by  the Government are not acceptable to the farmers, why does the Government  not withdraw these laws? After all, who is preventing the Government from  withdrawing these laws? In view of these situations, it seems that they have  not been chosen as public representatives but as the representatives of the  affluent. Today, the modernisation of the Mandis and the development of  infrastructure for this purpose are being debated, but I would like to ask the  Government why the mandis have not been  set up at Gazipur, Azamgarh and  Sultanpur?","Tuesday, February 9, 2021",Union Budget,M,SP,Blame

Farmers are sitting on dharna because these farm laws have  soft corner for corporates and provide opportunities to the corporates to rob the  farmers of their livelihoods.

As per the Hunger Index for 2020,  India stands at 94th position out of 107 countries being much behind Bangladesh,  Nepal and even Pakistan.  The Government must strike down the farm laws  immediately and work in the direction of eradicating hunger from the nation and  that is impossible without supporting the farmers.

642,SHRI SAPTAGIRI SANKAR ULAKA,"I would like to touch upon few key  things that are impacting the nation, specially tribals.  The three farm laws are  being vehemently opposed by farmers across the country and I would like to  highlight the impact of these laws on Adivasis.  These laws will violate rights of  the other traditional forest dwelling communities in the Fifth Sechedule and tribal  areas under the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA)  and the Forest Rights Act, 2006 (FRA).  These laws will erode the power and  authority of Gram Sabhas.  The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection)  Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 will give full control  to private companies over practice and method of farming and sale and purchase  of farm produce, including its pricing and marketing.  It will lead to alienation of  land of vulnerable tribal farmers.  The law will result in unequal bargaining  between these market forces and farmers with little resources and knowledge  about the mechanics of global food chain systems.  The Farmers‟ Produce Trade  and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 provides for building  alternative trading channels.  It also provides for giving any person or corporation  the right to trade in farm produce and giving anyone with a PAN number to  establish e-trading platform. It means deregulation of agricultural market, opening  it up to local and global trade chain in food commodities.  The Essential  Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 provides for the supply of foodstuff,  including cereals, pulses, potato, onions, oil seeds and oils, or anything else the  Government notifies may be regulated only under extraordinary circumstances.   These amendments paralyze Essential Commodities Act, 1955 which was  enacted to prevent man-made famines.  This allows hoarding through exemption  granted to value chain participants and this will lead to artificial price rise through  creation of artificial shortages.  This will lead to food insecurity and dismantling of  the Public Distribution System in the country.  The inflationary effect of  amendments to the Essential Commodities Act will amount to violation of the  right to food of the impoverished.  The farm laws violate the fundamental rights of  the Adivasis and forest dwelling communities.  They also violate special  protection provided under Article 244, the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution of  India and special laws, like PESA and FRA.  It includes dilution of the powers of  Gram Sabhas.  It will be unable to prevent alienation of tribal lands or exercise  control over money lending.  This will lead to dismantling of the control of Gram  Sabha over poverty reduction schemes and will reduce the power of Gram  Sabha to manage local village markets and Haats.  The farm laws will result in  erosion of Gram Sabhas when it comes to governance in Scheduled Areas.   Introduction of contract farming, new forms of money lending by large agri- business and commercialization of agricultural production will lead to unravelling  the tenurial security FRA has introduced for forest dwelling communities.  Their  nistar rights and grazing rights will be eroded.  I demand the repeal of these three  farm laws and I demand the Governor, in exercise of power under Para 5 of the  Fifth Schedule, to prohibit application of these three farm laws to Scheduled  Areas of their respective States.  Effective enforcement of PESA by  strengthening the control of Gram Sabhas over local rural Haats and pricing of  agricultural produce should be done.  Guaranteed Government procurement  should be done and MSP of farm produce and MFPs should be provided.   Niyamgiri judgement relating to Gram Sabha consent for development activities  in forest lands should be implemented strictly.  Guaranteed tenurial security  should be given under FRA.

Prime Minister should hold talks with the farmers only then this problem can  be solved.  The Government talks about the self reliance of the farmers. However  80% of our farmers own less than 2 hectares of land.  Even today the farmers  are apprehensive about the laws.  If the Government will determine the MSP  then why there is no provision in the laws. Today our BSNL/MTNL services have  already reached villages, instead of supporting them, the Government handed  over these services to corporates.  Had the Government given this work to  BSNL/MTNL then the work would have been completed in a short time and both  companies would have been benefited financially.  However, there is no mention  about the steps taken to make BSNL/MTNL competent.  During corona, 30 to  40% of MSMEs faced closure and lakhs of people became unemployed.  But  there is no mention in the President‟s Address as to what steps the Government  have taken for these unemployed people instead it gave permission to sell those  public sectors which were providing employment to the people.  On the one  hand, the Government says that there will be no written examination for Group  „C‟ and Group „D‟ categories however there are no jobs.  Recently all the  employees of Income Tax, Mint were recruited from outside the Maharashtra. Is it  fair or just?  Recruitment through Staff Selection Commission should also be  made within the state.  Three new laws were brought for the labourers, workers,  employees but unfortunately the provision of job security was removed.  There is  a reference regarding removal of Article 370 in the President‟s Address. But till  date Kashmiri Pandits have not been able to settle there.  The dignity of the  officers of Judiciary and Executive should be maintained.  Marathi speaking  regions like Belgaum etc. of Karnataka State should be given the status of Union  Territory.

Therefore, our demand to the  Union Government is that the percentage of reservation should be increased to  70% or more and the states should be given powers to make provision regarding  reservation for the backward classes and those communities which are deprived  even today.

Three quotations of three poets have been used in the Address  and the states to which these three poets belong, are going to have elections.   What is mentioned in these quotations is of utmost importance.  Hindustan  enjoys the status of a traditional nation.  It has always supported plurality.  Plurality accommodates differences, and differences embody and enact  dissent.  Therefore we should not be afraid of any debate or any dialogue or  any  dissent  because  our  civilization  always  encourages  dissent,  disagreement, debate, and dialogue.  I would also like to say that the  government should refer to all the great leaders of the Indian freedom  struggle.  Also, if we worship Bharat Mata, then people of every religion and  community also need to be taken together.  I would like to ask that why more  than 200 of our farmers have lost their lives during the ongoing farmer‘s  protest.  Why this government is not talking to the farmers. We are unable to  bear the plight of our farmers. Therefore, it is our strong demand that at least  the issue of farmers should be discussed separately and by negotiating with  the farmer, the demand of the farmers should be met.  As far as the Red Fort  incident is concerned, it should be investigated by a joint parliamentary  committee.   The Government had given permission for the rally. The  responsibility for deteriorating condition of the law and order lies with the  Government. The Government has been filing fabricated cases against the  leaders of the farmer's movement. The Government has been trying to divide  the farmer's movement. This movement has become a people's movement  now. There is nothing wrong if a small girl of 18 has expressed her support for  the cause of farmers. India carried out an air strike at Balakot a few days after  the Pulwama attack. Not a single person of this country had information about  this strike. How come a journalist got prior information about this strike. This  has jeopardised our national security. We wish that a JPC be constituted to  investigate into the TRP scam. The Government has claimed that the  Hindustan Aeronautical Limited has been building Drone warriors. My  question is why this company was not given opportunity to build Rafael.

Atmanirbhar Bharat  Campaign is not only restricted to developing the country but is also related to  uplifting the standard of living of every citizen of the country.  Our target would  be further strengthened by self-reliance in agriculture.  With this very thought  this Government has made efforts to bring about positive changes in every  system from sowing seed to marketing of crops during the last six years so  that the Indian agriculture is modernized and also expands.

The Government besides announcing a record economic package  to save the economy has also paid attention that not a single poor person  should starve.  Apart from providing the facility of One Nation-One Ration  Card the government provided free of cost foodgrains to the poor and also  plied Special trains for the labourers.  The Government in all its decisions, has  presented a unique example of collective power of federal structure.  The  coordination between the Centre and the State Governments has  strengthened our democracy and only enhanced the prestige of our  Constitution.

The Government is consistently  working for the multi-dimensional development of the villages today.  My  Government's priority is to uplift the standard of living of the rural people.  Its  best example is construction of two crore houses for the poor families from  the year 2014.  The Government has done a commendable job by expanding  the network of rural roads for fulfilling the needs of 21st century rural India and  equipping them with infrastructure. Providing internet connectivity along with  roads in the rural areas is equally important. After cent per cent rural  electrification, the Government is running a campaign to provide optical fiber  connectivity in more than six lakh villages of the country.  The small scale  industries, the village industries and MSMEs spread across in our villages and  small towns are the fundamental strength of our economy.  Several measures  have also been taken to expand the role of MSMEs in Atmanirbhar Bharat.   The Government has declared the National Education Policy in view of global  needs and challenges of 21st century.  The Government has also constituted  National Recruitment Agency to provide relief to the youth of the country from  appearing in separate examinations.  The Government is according priority to  every sector and ensuring development of every community with the mantra  of 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vishwas.'

This  pandemic seems to be having comparatively lesser impact in our country than  other countries. The Indians faced this epidemic by following all the guidelines  given by the government and it seems that they are on verge of gradually and  steadily conquering this abnormal situation. During the Corona epidemic, our  government launched the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyan, especially for the  workers of five-six states who returned to the villages from the cities. Under  this new campaign a large amount of employment equal to 50 crore work  days has been created.

I would also like to say that during lockdown unemployment has  increased considerably.    In our country 95% of the workers work in the  unorganized sector.  We have to see as to how we can protect them by  providing employment.  I would like to throw light on the economic inequality  prevailing in our country. With the passage of these three anti –farmer laws  during the last Session, inequality has increased in the country. The Covid-19  pandemic has exposed how deep rooted the economic inequality is even in  the field of education.   While the children belonging to rich families where   attending their online classes through smart phone, laptop and i-phone, the  children belonging to poor families lost their academic session due to lack of   modern digital devices. Alongwith this, the scholarship of more than 60 lakh  students belonging to SC/ST communities is pending  in 14 states . We don‘t  need privatization to remove such inequality instead there is a need to  strengthen Government educational institutions of the country.  Recently,  India ranked 94th among 107 countries in the 2020 Global Hunger Index.  Our  country is the fifth largest economy in the world.

The Code is also silent on international workers.  There is no  definition on 'international workers'.  There is clarification needed on this also.

This pandemic  has shocked the whole humanity. I believe that India and the US cannot be  compared on this count.

Targeted measures are needed for a section of girls with no access to ICTs.   Financial incentive programs can help encourage families to send children back to  school.  Cash transfer programs to the most vulnerable groups including women  will be necessary.  India's response to the pandemic has been 'reactionary' instead  of being 'preventive and precautionary'. The Centre failed to ensure sufficient  availability of PPEs to frontline healthcare professionals.  NGOs and State  Governments responded better to the needs of citizens than the Centre.  Until mid- July, 2020, there were only two laboratories in India to test and certify quality of  Body-Coveralls for COVID-19.  It was not until 16th July, 2020 that 9 other testing  facilities were announced.

Minister of Finance that tax refunds amounting to  Rs.1,06,000 crore  have been made to the taxpayers in the pandemic circumstances  during the period from 1 April, 2020 to 15 September, 2020.   The Government  wants to increase the number of taxpayers, give all facilities to the taxpayers,  ensure that honest taxpayer is respected and the taxpayer is not harassed  unnecessarily.  The MSMEs are under the focus of the Government and the  exemption relating to tax audit has been increased from one crore rupee to five  crore rupee to the MSMEs.  The dividend distribution tax has been withdrawn.   The private companies have been given 22 per cent tax liability under the  assessment.  A new set of rules have been framed this year for those who do not  pay their taxes honestly.  If an Indian citizen as a resident makes some earning in a  country where no taxes are charged then he has been made the resident of India  under the income tax.  The last date under the Viswas Yojana has been extended  from 30 June to 31 December, 2020.  A decision was taken in the 14th March GST  Council Meeting that no interest will be charged on the GST payable which is  debited via  ITC.  Its notification was issued later but the taxpayers falling in  between the period are in a dilemma, therefore, a clarification should be issued.   There are certain rules under the CGST which are crossing the CGST laws which  ought to be corrected.  A provision has been made in the Bill that empowers the  Government to constitute a taxpayers charter.  The taxpayers charter mandates that  the taxpayer should be treated with dignity and respect.  Ordinary citizens should  be trusted and if an ordinary citizen submits something then it should be relied  upon.  Earlier, this was not the situation and the system believed that the taxpayer  just cannot be honest.   Earlier, the taxpayer used to think that it would have been  better had he not paid the tax because in that case he would not have faced the  harassment. Now, it has been provided under the taxpayer charter that he can lodge  the complaint.  Faceless assessment has been introduced.","Saturday, September 19, 2020",Union Budget,M,BJP,Appreciate

The  supplementary demand for funds is about Rs. 1.67 lakh crore of which Rs. 1.62  lakh crore is the real revenue expenditure. Most of this amount relates to Covid  relief announcement made earlier. This amount would be 0.23 per cent of GDP.  This contradicts the falls claims of the Prime Minister when he said that India  would spent  10 per cent of its GDP as fiscal stimulus. It was a big lie. The fiscal  stimulus was merely 0.23 per cent of GDP. The Government has sought an  additional amount of Rs. 40,000 crore for MGNREGA. This is the real  contribution. MGNREGA saves all. There has been complete breach of trust by the  Centre as far as sharing of revenue with States is concerned. It is ironical that  States are being made to borrow. This exposes the Government's double speak and  the blatant attempts to expose our federal structure. Where is the Government's  additional spending on infrastructure? The only way to revive the industrial  activity and also to create jobs is by pumping huge amount in infrastructure  spending. The Government is either clueless or does not intend to spend on  infrastructure. So, the expenditure needs to go up to create more jobs. Push the  money in the hands of the people so that consumption picks up. Therefore, we say  to formulate a general grant scheme for poor migrant workers. The Government  talks about data but they have no data about  how many people have been died.  The Government's response to the pandemic affected economy made the situation  worse. We have asked to provide relief on indirect taxes like GST, extend the pay  protection scheme to protect employment and wages; increase spending on  infrastructure projects; pay the arrears of tax devolution and GST to the States so  that they may enhance their capital and welfare expenditure.  If the above measures  had been taken, they would have amounted to a significant fiscal stimulus to the  economy.  Another direct consequences of the closure of MSMEs is that of the 10  to 11 crore MSMEs in the country, it is estimated that all of them were closed in  April, May and June, nearly 30 per cent have shut down permanently and despite  Finance Minister’s instruction, banks are not providing funds to MSMEs.

Is it adequate to  ensure livelihood of these people?  Five kg of food grains was provided to 2 crore  66 lakh migrant labourers every month for two months. But regarding Atmanirbhar  package for the month of May, the hon. Finance Minister had announced that it  would benefit eight crore people. Apart from all this, i would also like to say that  nothing has been provided for weavers particularly for the weavers of Purvanchal  and Ambedkar Nagar in this Labour and Employment budget.  Today their  condition has been further deteriorated.  Over the last six years, the Central  Government has worked to weaken the financial autonomy of the States and this  crisis has culminated during the pandemic. The GST compensation due to the  States now stands at Rs. 2.35 lakh crore. Migrant workers were charged ticket fares  by railways. In Ambedkar Nagar, two trains had been suspended because of  COVID-19. I hope, the funds to be provided by the House to the Government in  supplementary Grants, will reach the poor so that they can get the benefit of the  said funds. Recently, the Government of UP has proposed that it will be mandatory  to work on contract basis for five years in case of Government jobs which is  betrayal with the youth.

There has been an exodus of labourers from various  states during the corona crisis due to which all economic activities came to stand  still.  In such a situation, MGNREGA is functioning as the biggest safety net.  The  Government has increased the wages given to MGNREGA workers from Rs 182/-  to Rs 202/- .  My request to the Government is that the wages should further be  increased and alongwith this the number of schemes for employment generation in  every village should be increased for MGNREGA workers.  The payment to  MGNREGA workers should be made on time.  Alongwith this, the working days  under MGNREGA should be increased upto 200 days. Covid-19 Safety Guidelines  should be complied at MGNREGA sites for the safety of the workers.

The traders from Jhalawar can sell their garlic or can sell their  oranges from Jhalawar not only at the urban mandi but they can sell their produce  in all parts of India. The Standing Committee on Agriculture (2018-19) had  mentioned that the APMC Act needs a change. The hon. Prime Minister and the  hon. Minister have made some changes. The object of the Ordinance is that it gives  the farmer the freedom of choice of trade and commerce. It brings the trader into  the formal economy. It also helps the SPOs. The primary agricultural societies  have also been given the opportunity to trade their produce on electronic platforms.  So, there will be no market cess; and there will be a dispute resolution mechanism.  With this, crop diversification will take place and it will give opportunities for the  farmers to grow their crops and sell the materials in all parts of India. The  industries will get the opportunity to make investments in agriculture and the  produce of agriculture will also get the opportunity to grow. National Agriculture  Marker, e-Nam, will encourage the sale of goods. The government of India has  made tremendous progress in procurement of wheat. In the State of Rajasthan, the  procurement has grown from year to year. I belong to Jhalawar-Baran. The farmers  at my parliamentary constituency can do farming outside their region and it will  develop our region and the 86 percent of small farmers will be benefited.

During the time of Corona, when the price of crude oil  has come down to two-three dollars per barrel, you did not lower the price of petrol  but raised it gradually. Eight-ten years ago, the price of onion reached 50 rupees to  60 rupees. At that time, the price of onion given to the farmer was 12 to 15 rupees  only but the market rate was between 55 to 65 rupees. This means that farmer was  working hard but someone else was taking the benefit. If this law can stop the  suicide of farmers, then the whole House will definitely support this.

In my opinion, only those cooperative banks, which are  financially sound and well managed for the next five years, should be allowed to  approach the RBI for getting permission to enter into the market and this Bill may  be amended suitably.  I think it is advisable to restrict the entry of new cooperative  banks and explore the possibility of merger of few big cooperative banks in line  with commercial banks.  Finally, in view of the Bill, the urban and multi-state  cooperative banks being governed by the respective Cooperative Societies Act of  the concerned State, will additionally come within the jurisdiction of RBI.

880,DR. KALANIDHI VEERASWAMY,"At the outset, I would like to say  that the existence of a chit fund in this country after over 70 years of Independence  is actually a shameful thing.  It is because people want to have access to money in  case of an emergency and this is supposed to be met by a banking institution or an  NBFC.  But the banking institutions have failed to meet such requirement.   Unfortunately, banks give huge sums of money to big corporate but these people  are not repaying it and they become NPAs.  It is either in collusion with these  companies or something as a result of which the banks end up in such a situation  where the money is lost forever.  In these kinds of situations, no action is taken  against the erring banks.  If you see the quantum of this chit fund business, it is  about anything from Rs.30,000 to Rs.50,000 crore.  I feel this legislation is going  to bring down the chit fund business which will again lead to a lot of  unemployment.  The existing chit fund operators, who were earlier charged 10 per  cent, are now being charged 12 per cent GST.  They have been asking for  exemption from GST but the rate of GST in their case has been increased.  So,  people who are doing this business are losing their interest.  Consequently, a  number of chit fund companies are on the verge of closure.  So, I would request the  Government to consider if the individuals who are running chit funds for Rs. 3 lakh  can be exempted from GST.  It will be of a huge benefit to the small people.","Monday, November 18, 2019",Union Budget,M,DMK,Blame

Initially in 2003, the West  Bengal State Assembly passed a draft Act and sent it to the Centre for assent.  But  the assent was not given.  Since then, on different occasions in 2013 and 2014, the  State Government of West Bengal communicated with the Central Government in  this regard.  In 2014, the Central Government again raised certain points.  The  State Government incorporated those points and passed the Protection of Interest  of Depositors in Financial Establishment Bill, 2013.  But, finally in 2015 that Bill  was enacted.  I would like to inform that the State Government of West Bengal  prepared a specific scheme for payment of compensation to the depositors in  distress and an amount of Rs.500 crore was earmarked for this purpose.  It was  known to everyone that a writ petition was filed in Sarada matter and it was  investigated by the CBI.  But the question is why till now charge sheets have not  been filed?   In the background of the fact that this august House has already  passed the Banking Unregulated Deposit Scheme Bill, 2019, is there any necessity  to continue with the Chit Funds Act?  I suggest the Government to scrap it as all  these provisions have already been in that Act.  Chit fund gives an incorrect  impression to the common people.  If chit funds are valid and ponzi schemes are  invalid, then how will the common people be able to make the distinction about  investing in chit funds or investing in ponzi schemes?   The investigation conducted so far puts a question mark on the role of regulatory  authorities like SBI, Registrar of Companies and officials of RBI.

Again, the fact of the matter is that the manner  in which the Government has gone about it is not the first time this has happened.   Under Article 370(1)(d), 45 Presidential Orders from 1950 with regard to Jammu  and Kashmir have been passed.  So the Order of 2019 of a similar nature that  supersedes all previous Orders.  This House has always been recognized as the  supreme sovereign body under the Constitution.  Therefore, this House always has  the power to deal with these exigencies and these situations.  So, I do not believe  that there should be any talk about any breach of faith.  I am of the opinion that this  august House should come together and send a message to our brothers and sisters  of Kashmir that they are integral to our Indian family.  There must be unanimity  within India because if we appear divided, we give a lot of power to forces outside  India to criticize us on this.

One of these pertains to the formation of Union  Territory of Laddakh without an assembly Legislature and the other one is  concerning formation of Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir  with an assembly  Legislature.  This is welcome move and has been hailed by the masses concerned.   Earlier, I happened to be part of a delegation to Kashmir and received firsthand  accounts of the pathetic condition people of J&K, who have been reeling under for  years together.  We learnt from the masses that there is no development in J&K  even tourism is in rough patch.  So is the case with employment and industrial  development.  So finding the happy medium seemed to be  the best way forward.  Yesterday, many people were saying that it is a dark day.  How can it be a dark day  if development will reach all the people, employment will be provided, industries  will be set up in Kashmir?  Therefore, it is not a dark day rather it is a  revolutionary day, a day of development.  Yesterday, hon. Home Minister has told  that he will make it number one state in the matter of development in the next five  years.  Jobs will be provided to the Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, youths of Kashmir.   Till now, there was no development in Kashmir, therefore, we are supporting this  Bill due to these promises.  Kashmir is a paradise on earth.

Let me explain why  we think it is indeed a dark day for India's democracy.  The Government has  brought this Bill to this House without consultation with the local parties, with the  State Legislature our of Session for more than six months and with democratically  elected political leaders.  The claim that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of  India is also our claim.   There is no political divide on that proposition.  But the  way you have pursued that claim with this Bill is an affront to our very values as a  democracy, as a nation and it has already done serious damage to our international  standing.  I am sure you will get this Bill through this House very easily.  But the  tradition of consultation and deliberation will lie in sewage.  This is a breath-taking  betrayal of our democracy and nothing short of legislative authoritarianism.  Let us  look at the short-term damage which has already been done.  Tourism, the lifeline  of Kashmir, has been devastated.  Today, advisories are back in foreign countries;  tourists are out; shikara operators are out of business; handicraft makers and carpet  weavers are broke and the Amarnath Yatra has been rudely interrupted.  Now, let  us look at the medium-term consequences.  You may drive more misguided young  Kashmiris to join the militants than ever before and our brave jawans will be even  more in harm's way and in danger as a result of this action.  The international  implications are very serious for our country.  The UN has issued a statement  calling for restraint.  Is this not embarrassing for our nation?  In the process, we  have also jeopardized our claims to PoK because that rested on the question of the  accession of the whole State and now the whole State no longer exists.  The  Government is in the habit of portraying opposition to its initiatives as anti- national.  We are the original party of nationalism.  Nehruji has also been  demonized here.  There is a misleading record in the House.  Nehru ji did not do  anything on his own.  There were three accessions.  They are Hyderabad, Junagadh  and Kashmir.  All three had to be treated by Nehru ji and Sardar Patel together  without an exception.

The other point to be considered is authorization for  termination of pregnancy if in the process of surrogacy, sometimes the surrogate  mother of the intended couple do not want the surrogate child, the rules should also  be framed correctively. An abortion of the surrogate child requires written consent  of the surrogate mother and an authorization by the appropriate authority. If a child  being born out of surrogacy arrangement is at the risk of physical or mental  abnormalities, under the Bill, only the surrogate mother’s consent will be required  to abort the child.  This Bill does not allow the storage of embryo or gamete for  surrogacy.

However, it is unfortunate that India has become a surrogacy hub with  a  rise in unethical practices.  Therefore, the Government has come with the  Surrogacy Regulation Bill, 2019.  The path of surrogacy is adopted when women,  who have medical problems or are in such conditions that they cannot conceive.   At times, surrogacy is a great abiding solution even for those who are not able to  adopt a child because of their age or marital status.  This also includes the gays.   Where there is no biological connect, the Surrogate mother merely carries the baby  to term and delivers to the couple.  In the wake of the passage of the Bill, there  would be an effective check on the exploitation of women and the role of  intermediaries would be a thing of the past.  Further, as per the provisions of the  Bill Indian couples legally married for at least 5 years would be allowed to exhaust  the option of surrogacy.  However, there are a few concerns we need to look into.   In the first place, surrogate mothers should be adequately compensated for coupled  with proper strict rules in place lest it should be subjected to commercialization.  Moving further, in view of the reports of the failure of altruistic surrogacy in  several countries, I would like to urge upon the Minister to make the Bill more  inclusive and not to restrict it to close relatives alone.","Monday, August 5, 2019",Union Budget,F,BJP,Call For Action

My suggestion is that even a  'close relative' chooses to be a surrogate mother, she should be adequately  compensated for.  Further, there is no mention of any specific time frame for  obtaining eligibility certificate from the competent authority by the intending  couple.  Besides, five years is a rather long period to be eligible, so it should be  reduced to 2 to 3 years.  Alongside,  transgenders including unmarried couples,  homosexual couples should also be included within the ambit of surrogacy.  More  importantly, couples with mentally or physically challenges child have been made  eligible to opt for surrogacy. It's not fair.  Last but not the least, complete ban on  commercial surrogacy would place surrogate mothers in a dangerous situation.

Among the whole host of provisions contained in the Bill  what assumes greater significance is that a surrogate mother will be allowed to  enter into surrogacy only once in their life time.   This would put a severe check on  the alleged tendency of being lured to be a surrogate mother.

These Boards will advise people regarding the Central Government  policy matters relating to surrogacy.  The National Surrogacy Board will also  supervise the state bodies.  There is a regulation in the Bill that only “close  relatives” can be surrogate mother and no one else could be. It has some problem  as the speaker prior to me has said – ‘closeness’ is not defined here. Suppose some  spouse live in orphanage who does not have any close relatives and if some  infertility case comes before them, where will they approach and who will become  their close relative in such a situation? I would like the Minister to ponder over  this. The provisions of penalty in the Bill are very good.

Regulating surrogacy is an urgent need and  the regulation of the same will go a long way in alleviating the difficulties faced by  the infertile couples.  But the Bill in the present form is thoroughly unrealistic and  self-defeating.  ‘Close relative’ is not defined in the Bill. Further, a close relative  surrogate may not be medically fit to be a surrogate mother.  Having a known  biological mother around is a serious issue and will have a bearing on the child  bonding with the intending parents, and it will surely impact the property rights  and succession laws. Hence, the word ‘close relative’ should be removed.   Altruistic surrogacy should be replaced with compensatory surrogacy as in the UK.   The modalities and terms of compensation may have to be worked out and  legalized.  The five-year duration after marriage is not correct particularly in those  cases where some congenital defects or serious medical disorders are present.  The  five-year wait clause has no meaning in cases where women are born without  uterus, that is congenital absence of uterus.  The insurance of the child born  through surrogacy should be included.  Maternity benefit should be given to the  altruistic surrogate mother if she is working, as per the Government law.  The law  should provide for surrogacy in legalized relationships as well.  The offence under  this Bill has been considered as cognizable, non-bailable and non-compoundable  which is too harsh and should be considered as non-cognizable offence only.","Monday, August 5, 2019",Union Budget,M,DMK,Call For Action

These extra three years that they  get when they come to the Supreme Court has made the race from the High Court  to the Supreme  Court which is totally undesirable. And unfortunately there is no  transparency in the entire collegium system and the system of appointment.  Many  High Court judges  would like to stay in High Courts only if they are in collegium  of the High Court or serving as the Chief Justice of the High Court rather than  joining the Supreme Court.  Therefore, the age of High Court judges should be  increased from 62 to 65 .  The Hon. Law Minister should consider it seriously.

However, a number of  States have expressed their apprehension about the Bill. An apprehension is there  that the Union may take control over all the dams.  Through this Bill, the  Government is acquiring the power.  The Government wants to give certain things,  even advice from the top.  The States should be empowered so that they will take  care of themselves because these dams have been erected by the States themselves  from their funds.  The Dam Safety Bill, 2019 continues to suffer from a number of  lacunae.  For example, the whole dam safety mechanism is dominated by the  Central Water Commission with Chairperson of CWC being the Chairman of  National Committee on Dam Safety.  The CWC is also involved in policy making  about dams, in their approval, guiding designs, financing, monitoring, approving  seismic parameters, flood forecasting and so on and so forth. Dam Safety is  essentially a regulatory function and thus CWC has clear conflict of interest in  being involved in the dam safety mechanism.  The CWC also has had very poor  track record in dam safety and the Kerala episode is the latest instance. The second  point is that the dam safety mechanism has to essentially work in public interest  and the people at risk are the biggest stakeholders, not only the State Governments.  Unfortunately, the Bill does not even define who are the stakeholders of dam  safety.  The Bill requires appointment of up to three, out of a total of 21 members,  specialists in the field of dam safety and allied fields.  But there is no mention of  these persons having an independent track record, nor is there any mechanism  mentioned as to how they will be selected.  I should also mention that dam safety is  a primary concern of this country. To protect life and property of the people of our  country, there is a need, but it has to be a regulatory mechanism.

The Union Government should take financial  responsibility for dam safety.  The State Dam Safety Organisation should not  override the existing State level bodies.  The Section 41 which deals with  punishment for obstruction in duty, is a very draconian Section.  The National Dam  Safety Authority should play a supportive and consultative role.

The legislation is primarily to look after maintenance,  surveillance and safety of the dams and has nothing absolutely whatsoever in  controlling the ownership, controlling of water or any other such ancillary subjects  which the Opposition may have any fears over.

The judge will be forced to directly question the child.  The child  being made to go into the details of the case will become another harrowing  experience for the child.  The entire nation believes that these people should be  shown no mercy.  Moreover, death penalty is not the answer to every crime in this  country.  Most of the countries are now moving away from this concept of  awarding death penalty.  The hon.

In  our judicial delivery system, there is a long gap between crime and punishment.   This Bill seeks to increase the quantum of punishment by including death penalty.

It seems as if it is restricted  to the Members of Parliament, but it is not so. This Bill’s effect is up to the ground  level public servants.  Now, the main objection is that he is going to the court.  Let  us assume that a person has been dismissed from service illegally, and he goes to  the court to get a stay. Do you think that the court is granting stay blindly unless a  case is made out by someone?  I am saying that it is a draconian law.  Unbridled  discretionary power has been entrusted or given to the Estate Officer. This power,  which has been given under Clause 4, is capable of being exercised arbitrarily. One  Estate Officer will fix a particular amount as damage and another Estate Officer  will fix another amount as damage.  There needs to be clarification on certain  points.  Suppose a dismissal has taken place. A person has gone to the court.  He  has not got the stay immediately. He is staying in the accommodation. After six  months, he has succeeded in the case. Will you evict him?  Or will you impose  damage?  Will that period be treated as unauthorized? Secondly, how much time  are you giving to him?  It must be of statutory one.  One must know this.  Clause 4  of the Bill is a draconian law and I am opposing this Bill on this ground because  the estate officer is given unbridled capricious power to impose damage without  laying down the guidelines and it is capable of being exercised arbitrarily.","Wednesday, July 31, 2019",Union Budget,M,TMC,Blame

It was way back  in the year 1956 that Inter-State River Water Dispute Act had been enacted.  Under  the Act there would be separate Tribunals for the resolution of Inter-State Water  Disputes.  In the first place, the Central Government used to make an attempt to  find a resolution of the disputes and subsequently in the event of the dispute not  being resolved, it would be referred to the Tribunal.  The irrigation potential of  every State is distinctly different from the other one.  So, it must also form the  basis for sharing of water.  Even in this day and age, in a few districts of  Marathwara region in Maharashtra water is made available by Rail.  It is essential  that in the event of disputes between the States over water the matter should be  referred to Dispute Resolution Committee or a Tribunal in order that the States  concerned may get their due share of water and there is equal distribution of water  across the country.  I would like to suggest that no member of the State concerned  should be taken on board in the Dispute Resolution Committee.

The first allocation of surplus Ravi- Beas River waters was made in the year 1976.  Thereafter, Haryana mooted the  construction of SYL canal to carry the waters allocated to it.  However, there was  no progress from Punjab side.  Ultimately, an agreement was signed among  Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. The construction of SYL Canal was inaugurated  on 11th April, 1982.  Thereafter, the situation became tense which ultimately led to  the Punjab settlement, popularly known as Rajiv Longowal Accord.  It was this  Accord which provided for the water allocation by a Tribunal.  The Tribunal  submitted its Report in 1987.  As some clarifications were sought under Section  5(3) of the Act of 1956, even after 36 years, it has not come to any conclusion.  So,  I want to say that it is not just a techno-legal but it is essentially a political issue.

So, my suggestion to the  Minister of Labour is to please interact and work with the Minister of Rural  Development also to ensure that the MGNREGA rate and the minimum wage are  synchronized in such a manner that benefits both the sectors.  I would request that  House Rent Allowance be included under wage.  The Code is also silent about the  discrimination in recruitment and I feel that it is a glaring gender discrimination  towards women.  Sub-Clause (3) to Clause 9, it says that the Central Government  consults the States in fixing the minimum wages. I suggest for considering of the  hon. Minister to substitute the word „consultation‟ with „concurrence‟.  It is only  then you get justified wages for the workers.","Tuesday, July 30, 2019",Union Budget,M,TDP,Call For Action

While codifying labour laws, labour interests should  not be overlooked. So, I think, this is something very important point that this  Government needs to understand.  The Government should clearly spell out as to  how it is going to protect the interests of the workers in unorganized sectors.  Just  making rules is very easy. But how are you going to implement them, and what is  the mechanism that you are going to use for this?  I would like to know what  would be the minimum wages in different states?  I would like to know what are  you going to do for SEZs?  We have had problems about SEZs several times. So,  how are you going to address it? You have said that there would be bonus for 20 or  more employees. The Standing Committee has recommended for 10 employees.  So, I would urge you to reconsider 10 employees because I see no reason why this  Government, which makes tall claims, should not do it.  Our country is very  complex in regard to providing jobs. Today, there are nearly 429 scheduled  employments and 1,915 scheduled job categories for unskilled workers.  This  massive expansion of job categories has led to a major variation.  So, how would  you come to a Minimum Wage Programme when India is such a complex country?   This Bill is a welcome step.  You are trying to do innovative things in the  Government. But you must pay salaries to the PSU employees and do think of  thousands of workers in the Air India today, who are contractual workers and are  not getting fair choice or salaries.","Tuesday, July 30, 2019",Union Budget,F,NCP,Blame

The definition of 'worker', 'employee', 'employer', and  'establishment' is comprehensive so that everybody has access to the benefits that  are contemplated under the Bill.  For the first time, a concept of floor wages has  been introduced.  The floor wages will give the base, the floor, and leave the  ceiling for the States.  Employment, adequate and reasonable wages and recovery  of wages – this is what an employee wants.  This Bill takes care of all the three  aspects of the problem. Section 45 of the Bill contemplates an authority which, for  the first time, is given the power to order payment of compensation in addition to  the claim determined.  A new concept of inspector-cum-facilitator has been  introduced.  The appeal for payment of wages would go to the district judge  concerned from the Payment of Wages Authority.

The provision  relating to timely payment of wages and authorized deduction from wages shall be  made applicable to employees irrespective of wage ceiling.  The provision of  Inspector-cum-Facilitator would end Inspector raj.  Equal remuneration to the  employees irrespective of the gender for the same work is a good reform.  I would  like to suggest an addition that the minimum wage structure proposed by the  National Minimum Wage Commission should be taken into consideration.

Regarding claims under the Code, application  may be filled within a period of three years.  The Bill prescribes one registration  for one establishment. The provision of „one licence, one return‟ in place of  multiple licences and returns in existing 13 labour laws is subsumed in the Code.

You have taken a very big bold step. None of  the political party in power showed courage to change an old law which was  already in use before the independence. But, this Government has changed this old  law from the time of independence. This law used to comprise of 44 laws in the  code of conduct for Labour. Now, these laws will be merged into 4 codes. By  constituting the Advisory Board, the Government has fixed the wage of labourers  which is a good step for the welfare of the labourers. The best part of this Act is  that it has the provision to increase the employment opportunities for women and  the safety of women. There are about 40 to 42 crores of labourers in the  unorganized sector of the country.  To protect the interest of the labourers in  unorganized sector is a big challenge for the Government and all of us. You have  brought this effective law which will definitely benefit the labourers in  unorganized sector. Women also work in unorganized sector. There is a need to  make a provision for their safety. If someone violates the formula brought by you,  there should be strict provision for that. If the provision is weak then the employers  will escape by giving low wages. Therefore, strict action should be taken and there  should be a provision for punishment in that.  If there are less than 10 number of  employed labourers in an institution, the provision for them is not given in this  code. Small companies will try to employ seven to eight labourers and the rest as  contract labourers. You should take note of it.

Provision has been made for the State Advisory Board in this  Bill. These Advisory Boards have a very important role in the Code of Wages Bill.  There should be a provision for domain expert in these Advisory Boards who can  know the issues on the field for which these advisory boards are working. I would  also like to suggest that revision of minimum rates of wages should be linked with  „Consumer Price Index‟ so that the workers or employers, covered under this  Code, can be protected from rise in price and inflation in the market.  The  Government should strengthen the system for identification of our informal sector  workforce to protect the interests of labourers in unorganized sector.  The trend of  contractual employment has increased. We have not made any provision to check  the exploitation of contractual workers and labourers. I have a doubt how the Code  on Wages Bill, 2-019 is going to address these very much important issues. The  lack of consistency in definitions within the Code may lead to employers  discriminating between workers and employees. Since minimum wage is a matter  of right for every working person, a common and comprehensive definition of  employees or workers should be given in the Code and experience and length of  service and experience in the field or in the organization or otherwise should also  be taken into account while fixing minimum wages.","Tuesday, July 30, 2019",Union Budget,M,BJD,Neutral

Also taking both, the unorganized  sector and the organized sector of the labour force, nearly 19 lakh people are  working in the tea industry.  You will be very unhappy to know that even today the  cash component of an average tea worker in the organized sector is barely Rs.167  per day.  The Plantation Labour Act, 1951 mandated that certain basic facilities  have to be given to our tea workers like medical facilities, housing facilities,  primary level education facilities, welfare facilities and leave with wages and  holidays.  Even those are monetized and added in the wages.  Along with that, the  statutory benefits like bonus, provident fund and gratuity is monetized and added  in the daily wages.  With this kind of hoax, will it raise the standard of living of the  most impoverished and the most backward working population of our country  today, the tea industry of Assam?  What is again very important is the  enforceability of the Bill.  The enforceability  of the Bill is very weak and feeble.   Penalty clause is also feeble and weak.  The working population of the unorganised  sector is suffering.  That is why, if this Bill, as it is presented here, as it is  introduced here, is passed, I am sure the working population of our country will  have a very big raw deal.

The Bill has designed the structure of the National Medical  Commission in such a way that the Government nominees are permanent but the  representatives of the States and the medical profession will only get a chance once  in 12 or in 14 years. The Bill provides for the setting up of the Medical Advisory  Council to advise the National Medical Commission.  But the paradox is that all  the members of the NMC are also members of MAC.

After all it was  whose responsibility to make available expert medical doctors and quality health  care.  Obviously, the then Governments were responsible for it, however, they  miserably failed.  Medical education became commercialized and corruption  rampantly prevailed. Our Government understood the ground reality and necessary  curative measures were taken.  Tourism has got 6.8 per cent share in our GDP.   There has been 25 per cent growth in our medical tourism.  Medical tourism has  got vast potential in India but we cannot achieve much in medical tourism unless  expert medical doctors are available in adequate numbers. Prior to introduction of  this Bill, our Government took several critical steps which have proved to be  milestones in this field and their positive results are also there.  In the year 2009,  Yashpal Committee recommended that accountability of the MCI should be fixed.   Thereafter, the then Minister introduced this Bill in Lok Sabha on 20th December,  2017.  During the last three years, as many as 121 new medical colleges have been  set up, out of which 61 are in public sector and 60 are in private sector.  There are  in all 536 medical colleges in the country and during the last three years alone, 121  medical colleges have been set up which is an eye opener.  Our Government has  also opened new medical colleges in 80 districts and 39 out of these 80 medical  colleges have become functional.  Earlier, a medical college had maximum 150  seats which has been increased upto 250 with 25 per cent increase in MBBS seats  and 33 per cent increase in post graduate seats during the last 4 years.  There was  shortage of teachers also.  Therefore, our Government increased the retirement age  from 65 to 70.  MCI had a rule that student professor ratio should be 1:1. We made  that as 1:2 and 1:3.  Earlier, every medical college had its own system.  In reality,  they had their own shops.  They had their own examination, own master and own  examiner.  Our Government standardized the medical education and introduced the  NEET examination for admission in MBBS across the country and nobody can  raise any question on this examination.  Several queries were raised regarding  community health provider.  Community Health Provider and basic medicines is a  recognized system world over.  The trained nurses can prescribe certain basic  medicines in the whole world.  A Commission has been set up in this regard and  whatever issues crop-up in future will be addressed there under.  Our next NEET  exam will be for admission in MBBS, licentiate exam and also entrance exam for  PG seats.  Students will get two-three opportunities for improving their marks.   The Bill provides for 25 members in the proposed Commission and out of 25  members, 21 will be doctors.  NGOs will also have their representation in the  Commission.  The bridge course under allopathic practicing system has been  discontinued.  It has been observed that the incidents of assaults on doctors have  increased in our country.  I would, therefore, exhort the people to keep in mind the  feeling of humanity in this regard.  There are about 80,000 MBBS seats in the  country, at present.  Out of these seats, 75 per cent seats are under regulation and  only 25 per cent are unregulated.

It is  unfortunate that less than two per cent of the Union Budget is allocated for health  in our country.  Asking for Exit Examination is like derecognizing all the previous  examinations that the child has passed through.  There is a total disregard of the  States’ involvement in the formation of this Bill.  Community health providers are  nothing but quacks and 57 per cent of them do not have any medical qualification.   If a six months course was enough for the practice of modern medicine, then why  do we have the four and a half or five years course at all?  This cannot be accepted.   Fund has to be allotted for more seats, for more teachers and for more equipments.   Cutting-edge research has to be done.  The students have to be encouraged to do  research.  About the formation of the Commission, the total supervision of the  Central Government without any election is very undemocratic.  We cannot have  the Chairman to be nominated.

No effective representation  of States has been granted in the Boards under the Bill.  It is not clear whether the  States have any authority to appeal against any decision of the Board.

They did not  have any representation in the MCI nor is it represented in the National Medical  Commission.  Next issue is, about non-experienced people being in control.  What  will happen if too many bureaucrats are brought into this. The problem in running  a medical college is not running the college, but running a medical hospital.

It seems pertinent to mention in this context  that a good number of specialists are being appointed in each Sadar hospital at the  district level.  Thanks to the initiatives undertaken by the Government of Bihar in  order that all sorts of medical facilities may be available in the rural areas itself.   With the passing of the National Medical Commission Bill, I am sure there would  be qualitative changes in the field of medical education in terms of transparency,  accountability and of course in the monitoring of medical education in the country.   A host of initiatives have been made by the Government to increase the number of  seats in various medical educational institution/medical colleges.  The conduct of  final MBBS exams of all the medical colleges simultaneously and the provision  of  NEXT is a laudable step.  This will facilitate the students and they will not be  required to take the PG Admission Test separately.  Due to unavailability of any  direct train from my Parliamentary Constituency Gopalganj people are compelled  to journey by train to the metropolitan cities in pursuit of their treatment.  If a  medical college is set up at Gopalganj district in North Bihar, this will go a long  way in providing proper healthcare facility to those living in the rural areas of the  district.

NMC will have nominated  members.  Even the committee in NMC had suggested that the number of members  thereon should be increased from 25 to 31.  I would like to request the Government  that if every State has to find its representation in the NMC, increase of members is  an imperative.  NEET exams are based on CBSE curriculum.  Different States have  their own boards in our country.  Unless and until the education is standardized  uniformly across the country, I am afraid, students will not be having a level  playing field.  It is very necessary to go for standardization of the boards in  existence in all the States.  Earlier, every university used to conduct its own exam  separately.  Henceforth, there shall be one National Exit Test for all the universities  which would maintain standardization.  As per the provision of the Bill, if a  student clears National Exit Test whether he would be subjected to an entrance  exam for post graduate seat or not, is not clear.  There is no clarity on as to how  many times would one be eligible to take the exam.

Thereafter, various countries across the world  provided for compulsory voting.  However, these laws were diluted over the time.  On the one hand, some of the research suggests that making provisions for  compulsory voting would increase the growth rate whereas some other research  work suggests that growth rate is not augmented even after the implementation of  provisions pertaining to compulsory voting.  Now-a-days, General Elections are  held across the country.  During the recent elections, 67 per cent voter turnout was  recorded.  There are 88  crore voters in India, out of which 61 crore had exercised  their franchise. Hon. Members have proposed in this Bill that a person should be  penalized if he does not take part in voting process.  In this regard, I would like to  say that there is a Parliamentary Constituency in India wherein compulsory polling  was done virtually in 1200 polling booths during the 2004 General Elections.  Out  of 1200 polling booths, 1100 booths had recorded 99.9 per cent polling.  So,  Election Commission had to take a decision for re-polling within the period of four  months in that case.  So, 100 per cent voting would be detrimental to the  democratic process. Apart from that, during 1952 election, per voter expense was  60 paise only, whereas in 2019, it has increased to 60 rupees per voter.  In all,  approximately Rs.4000 crore are spent in a General Election held in our country.   Though, the expenses incurred on compulsory voting have not much significance,   rather, I would say that perhaps we are not ready for making this arrangement.

If a person do not exercise,  his vote then he may be deprived of his voting rights or may be penalized for the  same.  Voting should be made compulsory and the term of reservation should be  doubled in order that in case of a candidate winning from the reserved constituency  he stays assured of his contesting election from the same constituency next time  and remains motivated to work properly.  If somebody desists from voting, he  should be penalised or be made to pay fine so that he may remain conscious in the  next election.

On making voting compulsory it will no more remain voluntary.  That  way citizens' right of liberty to make a choice would be suspended.  After the 10th  Schedule became a part of the Indian Constitution NOTA became a reality which  means the party candidate is not supported.  But it is also an opinion.

Section 62 of the Representation of People's Act states that every person who is in  the electoral roll of the constituency concerned will be entitled to vote.  This is not  discriminatory but voluntary.  So, I would say that compulsory voting in itself is  somewhat anti-democratic in the country because the freedom to speak necessarily  includes the freedom of not to speak. I would, therefore, say compulsory voting in  India is a bad idea.  This may be a good idea but if it is very difficult to enforce it.

The Muslim women  were left out of the process of changes which happened in the Hindu society.  To  bring the changes, somebody has to initiate.  Somebody has to show that political  courage, which this Government has chosen to showcase.  All of us need to  understand this aspect that women of this country are the biggest minority in this  country.  It is, therefore, incumbent upon us to secure justice for them.  There are a  number of persons in our country who want to mislead the society in the name of  religion.  We need not be swayed away by their rhetoric that such law will put  Islam into jeopardy.

As per this Bill, a Muslim man can be  jailed for upto three years along with a fine.  This provision has the potential to  destroy a marriage because of a false complaint by a scheming relative.  Besides,  this Bill is in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution as it discriminates Muslim  women and women of other religions.  The Ordinance also provides for  maintenance of the wife.  But, if the husband is in jail, how will he be able to  provide subsistence allowance?   Even the Supreme Court, in the Triple Talaq  Judgment, nowhere said that Triple Talaq should be a criminally punishable  offence.   This Bill is laid with a political intention to harass the Muslim  community and to portray Islam, the religion of peace and equality, in bad light.  If  the present Government is serious and sincere towards Muslim women  empowerment then it should come forward to address the issues of their  employment, education and technical skills and above all how will they be given  representation in local bodies, State Assemblies and Parliament.

I begin by questioning as to why this  Government is in such a hurry to bring this Bill.  We are passing Bills here without  enough representation of women. So, please pass the 33 per cent Women’s  Reservation Bill before the Government talks about women’s rights.  Have we  even thought of bringing a Bill to end honour killings which happen in the name of  caste and religion?  Have we brought a law to punish people who indulge in mob  lynching and mob violence in the name of religion?  This is the need of the hour  and there is an urgency to bring Bills to check such incidents.  This law is short- sighted, discriminatory and divisive.  When the Supreme Court in the Shayara  Bano Vs. Union of India case has outlawed the triple talaq, talaq-e-biddat, then  what is the need for this Government to bring this legislation?   There are blatant  deficiencies in this Bill.  One is the penal provision in the present Bill under  Section 4, which provides for an imprisonment of up to three years and a fine.   What is more interesting is this.  Section 79(c) of the Bill prescribes preconditions  for the bail, which are not in accordance with the legal principles of this country.  I  would also like to ask the Government that why it is only concerned about Muslim  women in this country?  Why it is not concerned about Hindu women or Christian  women?  Rather, I would say that our domestic violence laws are stronger than  your Bill and they protect the Muslim women also.  Let me know talk about rights  of women, about their marital relationship.  So, I would like to know about their  stand on rape laws within a marriage?  The statistics prove that there are more  Hindu women abandoned in this country as against Muslim women.  This  Government is doing nothing for them.

According to us, divorce by triple talaq is a  threat to social security and well-being of a society as a whole.  We have some  strong points against this Bill.  Under this Bill, there is a provision for three years  of imprisonment to husband.  A man who is imprisoned cannot look after his  family.  So, the question of giving maintenance by the husband will be moot if the  person is in jail.  So, if this provision of imprisonment persists, then the said Bill  would lead to injustice and make a woman's life deteriorate further.  We, therefore,  propose that this Bill should be referred to a Joint Select Committee.  We want to  see that women problems are sorted out, whichever community they may belong  to.

It is happening  that in the hope of better returns for themselves and their families, the poor people  find that the promoters of the company have vanished or their money has been  unfairly diverted. In my state, the ‘call money’ racket was quite infamous where  poor persons were given small amount of loans at extremely high interest rates on  a daily, weekly and monthly basis. In case, the women were unable to repay the  amount, they were exploited sexually. A similar type of case was that of ‘Agrigold’  scam. The poor people and middle class people were lured to invest with the  promise of very high returns. However, on one find day, the promoter of this  company closed down the company. Apart from these two Vizianagaram, a  company called Indie-trade also did a similar fraud. Having seen all this from close  quarters, I totally support this Bill. I also hope that this proposed Bill has adequate  mechanisms by which the depositors can be repaid without delay by attaching the  assets of the defaulting establishments. However, the Bill should also ensure that  no hardship is caused to genuine businesses or to individuals borrowing money  from their relatives or friends for personal reasons or to tide over a crisis.","Wednesday, July 24, 2019",Union Budget,M,YSR Congress,Issue

The separation  of powers is a concept which underscores the independence and is vital to our  democratic checks and balances.  This Bill is an attempt to undermine the  independence of Information Commission and thereby dilutes the framework of  transparency in the country.

RTO officers should challan those violating the traffic rules  only and they should not collect the challan money.  This should be done by some  other officials to eliminate the possibility of corruption.

Religion is not just about going to a temple,  mosque or church.  We should behave with others in the same way as we wish for  ourselves, that is true religion.  We never talked about the human rights but about  commitment to duty and good manners and etiquettes.  It has also been emphasized  that the man should enjoy his life after serving others first.  Whatever exists in this  creation, man is just a trustee of it.  We all are here to enact such a law to make  man a better human being and protect his rights. Most of the human rights  organizations are foreign funded.  These organizations act against Government  departments, officers, employees, police, army etc.  They do not act against  terrorists and naxalites.  The Union Government had set up a Committee under the  Chairmanship of N.N.Vohara in the year 1993 to conduct an enquiry into the  Mumbai bomb blast.  The Committee had mentioned about a nexus between  politicians, bureaucrats and human rights organisations in its report.  These  organisations and some political parties politicise terrorist attacks and other such  incidents.  Article 25 to 30 of the Constitution has been interpreted in such a way  that minorities have the power to administer their religious institutions but the  majority community cannot do so.  Is that not the violation of Fundament Rights of  the majority?  All are equal before law.

Just appointing one more person  would not solve any purpose because there are over one lakh cases, which are  pending.  At least, 50 per cent of it should be women.

NIA is either attaching the properties of a number of  terrorists or filing a case against them.  The biggest impact of demonetisation is  that stone pelting and naxal activities have come to an end.  The third biggest  amendment is in the Black Money Act.

High taxation compels Indian  businessmen to move to low tax haven countries.  Corporate promoters would keep  profits  in companies instead of distributing them as dividends because of heavy  tax burden.  Data shows that when tax proceeds increase, the cess collected also  rises.  It is shocking that the funds raised through cess remained dormant till the  year 2018.","Thursday, July 18, 2019",Union Budget,M,BJD,Issue

It is certainly going to result in  brain drain from this country.  With low rate of taxation, tax compliance is on the  higher side and vice versa.  By implication, in case of 42 per cent taxation, the  affluent ones would tend to avoid paying taxes by exhausting the loopholes  existing in the system.

A huge enhancement in this outlay itself is an indication of the progress,  growth and development that took place in the Indian economy.  From 2003 to  2012, India achieved GDP growth rate of more than 7.6 per cent on an average for  10 years and in 2009-10, the GDP growth was 8.6 per cent in spite of the global  economic recession.  Who had initiated the Green Revolution?  The Green  Revolution resulted in record grain output.  In 1947, our food production was 50  million tonnes which was increased to 264.38 million tonnes in 2013-14.  Have we  not done anything for the country?  In 1970, Operation Flood, was launched with  the help of Dr. Kurien.   From being 50th in the world in terms of milk production,  India became the largest producer of milk in just a couple of decades and by 1975,  all imports of milk and milk products were stopped whereas, earlier, we had to  import milk powder.     So, Congress is the soul of the nation.   You will lose your  entire identity without Congress.     In 1947, there were just 30 dams in the country  which increased to over 4000 by the year 2000.  India ranks third in the world in  dam building.  Are you not proud of it?     Who had built Bhakra Nangal Dam,  Sardar Sarovar Dam, Hirakud Dam, Nagarjuna Sagar Dam, Idukki Dam?  The  Congress established Indian Oil Corporation Limited, Oil and Natural Gas  Commission, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, National Thermal Power  Corporation, State Bank of India and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited.   Jawaharlal  Nehru and Homi Bhabha are known to be the architects of nuclear research in  India.  We also did nuclear explosion and Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji also did it.    We appreciate Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.  Pradhan Mantri Sadak Yojana was   his brain child.  You wrote such a long Presidential Address but if you could have  taken Nehruji's name even once, we would have felt good.  But, you do not want to  take our leader's name, you try to exclude us.  By the end of 2013, India had 68  nuclear reactors.  In 2008, the Indo-US Nuclear Agreement was signed paving the  way for nuclear energy production in India and which was opposed by the BJP.    DRDO and ISRO were established by the Congress.  Could Modiji have thought  about Chandrayan had Congress not developed Space technology?  At the time of  Independence in India, literacy rate was 12.2 per cent which increased to 71.96 per  cent by 2013-14.  There were only twenty-seven universities in 1950-51 which had  been increased to 821 in 2013-14.   Shri Rajiv Gandhi pioneered telecom  revolution in the country.    Shri Rajiv Gandhi had heralded the telecom revolution.  A number of  schemes had been launched and Acts passed during the Congress regime like  MNREGA, Right to Information Act, Right to Education Act, Land Acquisition  Act, Food Security Act, Forest Right Act etc.  The NDA Government has only  renamed the schemes launched by the UPA Government.  In comparison to the  UPA, the performance of the NDA Government has been dismal.  The GDP  growth has come down.  The exports have collapsed.  The NPAs have piled up.  The rupee has seen steep devaluation.  The rate of job creation has come down.   The trade war between the USA and China has begun.  The USA and Iran are on  the collision course.  The US Government has withdrawn the special trade status  given to India.  The Government should deal with this issue very carefully.","Monday, June 24, 2019",Union Budget,M,INC,Blame

He put a check on corruption during his term from  2014 to 2019 and the people of the country endorsed his performance.  His  decisions of surgical strike and air strike have earned respect to the country among  the world community. The country can develop only when regional development  takes place.  If the Government formulates any concrete programme to extend  assistance to the States, that will  be a step in the direction of fulfilling the regional  aspirations.  Bihar is a State where the Government could successfully provide  electricity to every household.  This Bihar model was adopted as a national  programme in the year 2017. Now the Bihar Government is providing separate  feeders for agriculture and the farmers.  We want that the Government should  reduce the centrally-sponsored schemes and the powers should be vested with the  States to formulate schemes according to their needs and to spend funds thereon.  I  urge upon the Government to reach out to the Government of Nepal and construct  high dams over the rivers flowing down from Nepal in order to control their  current.  Farm production in the country is increasing but the farmers do not get  remunerative prices.  The Government needs to give serious thinking on this  problem so that the farmers can get remunerative prices of their produce.  Cottage  industries, small industries, food processing units and agro-based industries need to  be promoted for employment generation. Entire country is faced with drinking  water crisis.  Water table is continuously depleting.  This problem needs immediate  attention.

The people  have again voted Modi ji to power on the basis of his previous Government’s  achievements. But, a lot is still there to be done.    As per my opinion hon. President should have also mentioned about the  Woman Reservation Bill.  The time has come to pass this Bill in Lok Sabha.    Today, women are aware.   Women of every section are now eager to join this  House.   Woman Reservation has been successful at every level be it panchayat or  legislative assemblies and the time has come it to be successful at Lok Sabha level.

The justice for the people of this country is delivered through High  Courts.   In my opinion their retirement age should be increased to  65 year so that  they may feel fearless while delivering justice.   Hon. President has mentioned  about Fani cyclone in his Address.   Prime Minister himself had visited there.  I  thank him for releasing Rs.1000 crore to Odisha Government immediately.    During the last six years, Odisha has been hit by four major cyclones i.e. Hudhud,  Phailin, Titli and Fani and this has pushed Odisha's growth decades behind.

I hope that the dignity of the  Opposition Party in the world's largest democracy and the autonomy of the  autonomous institutions will remain intact.  The Hon. President, in his address, has  mentioned several schemes for the farmers, however, I believe that all these  schemes will be effective only if these schemes are taken from paper and from  Government offices to the doorsteps of the farmer.  I would like to draw the  attention of the Government towards import and export policies and request that it  should be formulated in the interest of the farmers.   My request to the Government  is that steps should be taken at the earliest for providing relief in drought affected  areas. A mention has been made regarding development of livestock in President's  Address.  Bullock Cart race takes place in Maharashtra.  This tradition is more than  400 years old which is facing ban since 2011.  Bullock Cart racing is not only a  means of entertainment but it could be a potential source to strengthen the rural  economy.  My request to the Government is that an ordinance should be  promulgated to protect indigenous cow progeny and to save this tradition.  In the  President's Address, a mention has been made about tribals also.  In my  constituency, there are three such tehsils which are inhabited by tribals. There are  Sahyadri mountain ranges which are known as Western Ghats.  There are lots of  medicinal plants in this area.   A National Research Centre should be set up to  conduct research on these medicinal plants so that these plants can be used  scientifically for the benefit of the people and it can be used in Ayurveda. There is  no BSNL connectivity in tribal dominated parliamentary constituency.  I would  also like to draw the attention towards health. Malnutrition makes children  vulnerable to infectious disease. Therefore, the allocation which has been reduced  under ICDS scheme should be increased.  It has been mentioned in the President's  Address that there is a possibility of increasing the seats in higher education by one  and a half times by 2024.  Instead of increasing the seats, it is necessary that there  should be employability in education.  By 2027, when our population crosses the  population of China, the country will have young leadership. So, it is necessary to  have comprehensive changes in our education system. The Hon.

This Government has electrified every household of 18000 villages.  For fulfilling  the dream of the poor in villages to have their own pucca house, Prime Minister  Modi ji has increased the amount under Pradhan Mantri Aawas Yojana without  any discrimination.  Earlier, the amount was 70 thousand which has been increased  to Rs.1,50,000.  When Pradhan Mantri ji talked about toilets from the rampart of  Red Fort in the year 2014, the people mocked him but our Prime Minister  promised to provide toilets in every household.

So far as the condition  of the memorial at Jallianwala Bagh is concerned, it is not kept well.  The  photographs have already become very yellow.  I am really thankful to the  Government that they have brought this Bill.      The first Government which came into being after Independence, to form a  memorial and, quite rightly so, Dr. Ambedkar moved that resolution as the Law  Minister, when the trustees pass away without bequeathing the property to  subsequent trustees, that property  becomes an escheat property because ultimately  the escheat property will be vesting with the Government.  During that period, as  many lawyers were part of the struggle for independence, they said that make it the  property of the Congress or form a society where Congress leaders would be  heading that property or society.  That is the way in which in 1951, a memorial  trust was created.  Now, amendments have come and I fully endorse the  amendments that are there with the Prime Minister as the head of the trust.  The  Leader of the Opposition or the leader of the largest party in opposition has been  added in the trust and that is a welcome step.    The massacre of Jallianwala Bagh  reverberated in Odisha.  Utkalamani Gopabandhu Das brought the nationalist  fervour to Odisha as Bhagirath brought Ganga to Bharat.  He dedicated his whole  institution to the cause of Lala Lajpath Rai to the Servants of People Society.  In  every way, this Jallianwala Bagh had an impact on everybody's mind.

The Congress Party is constantly quoting the name of HAL whereas this is only a  company.  When the Modi Government came to power, it immediately constituted  the SIT  on black money.

We have come out with some  good schemes like Mudra loan but we should also check whether the schemes are  actually having an impact on the ground or not.

It should be extended in a  way that when anyone having a BPL card goes directly to the hospital, he should  get free treatment under Ayushman Bharat. This is my suggestion.

We are the pioneers  in reducing the farmer’s input cost. Telangana is the only State which has MSP for  almost 11 crops. The good part of it is that the Government of India as also many  States are drawing inspiration from our State.  Regarding 'Sabka Saath, Sabka  Vikas' I must tell you that we have khali haath. For Kaleshwaram Project they did  not give anything. Telangana is the only State which gives to almost every  household potable tap water.

Even AIIMS has been opened there.  Roads have been constructed in  every village under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana.  All this instilled a sense  of confidence in the farmers and the youth.

However, the farmers were left in the  lurch.  The backbone of small traders have been broken due to implementation of    GST and de-monetization.  These ill-conceived moves have devastated their  business.  Farmers are being promised Rs. 6000/-annually in their accounts.

Our economy is the fastest growing  economy in the word and achieved highest growth rate in these 5 years since the  economic reforms started in 1991. Today, India is the 6th largest economy. The  Government has successfully achieved highest growth rate, controlled two digit  inflation and maintained fiscal balance. India has also attracted huge FDI  amounting nearly 239 billion USD during the last 5 years. Last 5 years have seen  the fast infrastructural reforms and have paved the path for higher growth rate for  many coming decades. I am happy to know that the 22th AIIMS is going to be set- up in Haryana. Targeted development works are being carried out in 115 most  backward districts under Aspirational District Programme. For the first time, the  MSP of all 22 crops was announced at least 50% more than their input cost. The  government is going to launch a historical programme named Pradhan Mantri  Kisan Samman Nidhi PM-Kisan with annual outlay of Rs. 75 thousand crore to  ensure certain fixed income for small and marginal farmers. The Government has  taken decision to set up a separate department for fishery. New Pension Scheme  has been more libralised by increasing the share of government from 10% to 14%  while retaining the employees' share of 10%. The minimum wage for all category  employees has also increased by 42%.  42 crore workers of the un-organised sector  contribute nearly 50% in the total GDP of the country. The Government has  proposed to initiate a comprehensive pension programme named Pradhan Mantri  Shram Yogi Maandhan for these workers of unorganised sector. The Government  has also proposed to set up a Welfare Development Board under Social Justice and  Empowerment Ministry with the aims to implement welfare and development  programmes meant for denotified, nomadic and semi-nomadic communities. More  than 1 crore youths are being trained under PM Kaushal Vikas Yojana so that they  may earn their livelihood. All these efforts have made India world's second largest  start-up hub. The government has envisaged a national programme for Artificial  Intelligence and allied technologies so that its benefits reach masses. Many  effective measures have been taken to strengthen the small and medium  enterprises. The government has set up government e-market place two years ago.  The total transaction amounting Rs. 17,500 crore has been done through this GeM  and has resulted in average of savings of 25% to 28%. It is for the first time that  defence budget for 2019-20 is going to cross the Rs,3,00,000 crore. Now more than  100 airports are operational in the country. Domestic air traffic has grown two  times in the last 5 years. India has become fastest highways developer country in  the world. The railway passengers are getting world classes facilities with the  operation indigenously designed and manufactured semi-high speed train Vande- Bharat Express. The people of North-East region are also getting the benefits of  infrastructure development. The government is going to start containers cargo  transportation in the North-Eastern region through Brahmaputra by improving  navigation capacity of the river. For the first time, Arunachal Pradesh has made its  place on civil aviation map and Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizorm on India's railway  map. Now, India has become the largest data consumption country in the world.  The number of companies manufacturing mobile and mobile components has  increased from 2 to 268. The government has reduced the tax rate. The  implementation of GST of undoubtedly the biggest tax reform after independence.  The government in committed to wipeout the evil of black money. The  development in our government has transformed into mass movement. My  constituency Misrikh is one of the most backward areas in the country. It needs fast  development work. Last year also, I made a demand to construct an embankment  on the left bank on the river Ganga flowing from my constituency. There is a need  to construct ROBs and RUBs on all the unmanned level crossings there.   PROF. SAUGATA ROY: This year unemployment is at an all-time 45  years high, at 6.1 per cent.  National Sample Survey Organization data has not  been published.  The Government is not allowing them to publish the data on  unemployment which is at a very bad state.  Total Non-Performing Assets of the  banks have crossed rupees 11 and a half crore, an all-time high.  The Government  has not been able to bring back the people who fled with bank’s money.  The  Interim Finance Minister has presented an ‘Account for Votes’.  This is only a  vote-oriented Budget.  The Government has tried to apply ‘betadine’ to the wounds  created by demonetization.  Ultimately, the Government has not been able to bring  back black money into the system.  The Government has gone on changing the tax  rates as a result of which the GST collection this year is Rs. one lakh crore which  is less than  the previous budged.  The Andhra people have a justified demand for a  special category status, but that is not being listened to.  I would urge the  Government to announce something about it.  The Government has announced  Rs.6000 per year per family which comes to Rs.500 per month and Rs.17 per  family per day.  It is too little and too late.  Provident Fund-linked Pension Scheme  too does not sound promising at all. The Government has presented an  expansionary Budget and prioritized populism over fiscal prudence.

In 2014 General  Elections, the people voted in favour of Bharatiya Janata Party Government and  showed faith in it regarding creation of a new India.

L.T.C. facility should be provided to the  retired Government officials once in four years. The Government should make  efforts to provide one community centre, one hospital and one primary school in  each village.

I would like to begin by congratulating the Finance Minister  for this budget which has made several promises, set a commendable policy  outlook when it comes to sectors like agriculture and health.  The government  plans to revive the rural economy through greater government welfare  interventions.  All key infrastructure programmes- Swacch Bharat, Awas Yojana,  MGNREGS have seen a reduction in allocation.  Lives in villages cannot be  improved unless the occupation of its inhabitants is made profitable and  productive.  Agriculture in our country contributes to 16% of country's  GDP and  employs 49% of total workforce.  Under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman  Scheme the farmers would be given an assured income support of Rs. 6,000 a year.   The effectiveness of the scheme on the lives of farmers can easily be judged by the  fact that Rs. 6,000 per year translates into a mere Rs. 17 per day for the farmers.   The Government has also reduced its expenditure by around 2% on Rural  Employment.  This makes me question the seriousness of this government towards  improving the lives of the farmers.  Another core agri-crisis that has ailed our  country is of access to formal banking institutions.  Studies indicate that 1/4th of  the direct agriculture finance given to farmers in India are given through  Urban/metro branches.  Delving into some of the details of schemes for Education  and Health, their allocation and the harsh realities of our country, paint a  worrisome picture. In the education sector, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and Rashtriya  Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan have seen no budget allocation this year.  The aim of  the Government to provide health insurance is commendable and if implemented,  it would the only programme of its kind in the world.  However, the budget  documents do not support the claim made by the minister as there is no budgetary  allocation for this scheme. There is very insignificant increase in the budgetary  allocation of Human Resources for Health and Medical Education.  The  government has decided to reduce the budgetary allocation of one of its most  important schemes Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY) which provides for  social security to workers in the unorganized sector.  The Government has reduced  the allocation for Post Matric Scholarship both for OBC and SC students.  The  allocation for the entire Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries  has seen a reduction in the budget.  Balasore alone generates revenues of more than  Rs. 80 crores annually for Railways, there has hardly been any heed to the  development of the section despite repeated requests. This budget has many  positives and a few concerns which it hasn't addressed.

All types of necessary facilities should be made available for the  handicapped persons at all the railway stations in Mumbai.  The allocation of funds  for Kaushal Vikas Yojana should be enhanced.  At least one government school  should be opened at the localities inhabited by the Government employees in my  parliamentary constituency.  The sportspersons who play the games like Kho-kho  and Kabaddi should be incentivised under the Khelo India Scheme.  Relief should  be given to 100 employees of MIDC in my parliamentary constituency.

There is an airport at Juhu in my  parliamentary constituency.  Slums  have come up on the land of Airport Authority  around that airport.

Today, I stand in  total contrast to my feelings.   The present Government has come up with a  Budget where they want to woo the votes.  One of the priorities of our demand  is the Special Status for Andhra Pradesh.  Whatever we have been asking is  something which has been promised by the previous Central Government and  the present Prime Minister also.    The Government has misled the country by  saying that the States which have already been getting Special Status would not  get any more benefits after 2015, which is also wrong.  The States of the North- East are getting all the benefits under the Special Status name.  Our  Chandrababu Naidu ji has just asked to implement the Andhra Pradesh  Reorganisation Act.  I reiterate my demand of railway zone in Uttar Andhra  Region.  The Government of India had given Rs.350 crore to seven districts of  the State under the backward districts fund but they have taken it back.  They  are saying that there is a lot of corruption happening in the State.  This is not  true.  There are 600 programmes where Andhra Pradesh is leading the country.    Apart from the other demands, there is a demand of Amravati also.  We have to  build our own Capital and we need sufficient funds for that.  Polavaram project  is the lifeline of Andhra Pradesh.  The State Government has taken the  responsibility of building the Polavaram.  There are so many things like  Duggirajapatnam Port and Kakinada petrochemical complex that are still  pending under the Act.  Now, we want to go together to fight for the justice.   This kind of injustice is not just happening with Andhra Pradesh.  We have seen  that this kind of injustice is happening with all States.  CBI, ED, IB, these kinds  of institutions are being misused and they are sent on to the opposition to kill  the opposition.  This is not good for this democracy.  The Government is giving  Rs.6000 per year to the farmers but this is done only to woo the votes.  The  Government is afraid to release the data of farmers committing suicides,  unemployment data and any kind of economic report. The Central Government  keeps saying that they have granted 11 institutions to Andhra Pradesh but there  are a couple of other institutions that need to be set up there. Approximately  Rs.12,000 crore worth of land has been given.  An amount of Rs.12,000 crore  more is required to be put in by the Central Government to construct these  institutions.  A lot of such issues are pending.  I hope the Government realises  that the country is about the people as said by the great Telugu poet Garazada  Apparao.  PROF. RICHARD HAY:  The Central Interim Budget is not only poor and  farmer oriented, but also is pro-women and its main thrust is inclusive growth. Due  to the present fiscal management and control, fiscal deficit and inflation have been  maintained judiciously for the good of the country. The NPA defaulters are paying  up and bank transactions have become transparent. The FDI influx has been  increasing due to the effective financial policies executed by the Government of  India. International financial institutions have been complimenting the country's  economy. The Government has extended welfare measures to the poor by bringing  down the prices of food and other necessities, cardiac stents, medicines and houses.  The MSP has been increased by one and a half time the cost price for 22 types of  crops. Additionally, through DBT, Rs. 6000 is credited in the accounts of farmers.  The Government's has decided to extend a helping hand to the unorganised sector  by providing a sum of Rs. 3000 as part of social security measures. The youth of  the country has been supported by this Government by way of Skill Development  Programmes, Mudra Loans, Start up, Stand up, Make in India, Entrepreneurial  Development, etc. Record making construction of highways, inland waterways,  railway tracks and airport to facilitate regional connectivity throughout the country  has strengthened infrastructure in the country. This Government has protected the  lives of millions of poor patients by providing free healthcare through the most  visionary project - ""Ayush Bharat"".

Instead of tackling the issue of unemployment through  implementing a proper scheme, the Government tries to hide the actual figures.

Approximately 70 per  cent of our country's population is relating to farming and are farmers. They are in  great distress; thousands and thousands of farmers have committed suicide because  of failure of earning out of farming. Giving dole of meagre amount of Rs. 6000/-  per year or 17 paise/day is really an insult and of no use. They do not want dole,  they are working hard to earn, let Government try to decrease the price of fertiliser  and irrigation cost and electricity cost. Some lollypop is offered to low and middle  income individuals, asha workers, home buyers, builders, unorganised sector  workers. Government is shedding crocodile tear for unorganised sector labourers.  Government has sanctioned Rs. 3000/- per month of pension for them after  attaining 60 years of age which is very low. Pension value should be at least five  thousand for unorganised sector workers. They need free healthcare facility,  education for their children. There is hardly any increase in job opportunities for  the youth. Government hardly cares for health of mass population, budget  allocation in health sector is not up to mark. There is rather decreased budget  allocation to Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, mid-day meal etc; cut in minority welfare  schemes. Environmental pollution and eco-balance are not a great threat to  agricultural production, fisheries and public health. Air pollution is increasing lung  cancer, global warning causes drought, flood etc.  In this budget, there is no  mention regarding this.

They must be allowed to visit the army dwelling and working places  so that they may have an idea of the real life style of armed forces there.     Hon'ble Modi has managed to get approval of the UNO to observe 21 June  as Yoga Day. We must endeavour to provide jobs for more and more people by  promoting Yoga and Wellness-meditation spas.         The paintings by Shobha Singh in our state is popular all over the world.   But today it is battling for its existence. We could not protect the Rodriguez Art  Gallery where a great Russian painter lived and worked. We should try for a joint  venture with India-Russia culture centres. Can we do something to revive the  paintings of Shobha Singh?     In Andaman and Nicobar Islands, we have tribes, forests and one of the most  pristine beaches in the world. Moreover they are rich in corals and sea life. We  must make it a tourist hub by enabling all flights from Europe to land there before  going to Japan, Australia etc. We can create economy in Andaman and Nicobar  Islands more gigantic than Singapore.

1382,SHRI MALLIKARJUN KHARGE,"I thank the Hon. President for  addressing hon. Members of both the Houses.  But in his Address he has repeated  the same things which have been narrated by our Prime Minister during the last  five years. An effort has been made in the Address of Hon. President to compare  the achievements of this Government with that of the previous Governments.  It  would have been better to mention the ideas of this Government only.  The  Constitution of India has given equal rights to every citizen but this Government  has weakened every Constitutional institution. Reservation for dalits and backward  classes is also being abolished.  Our Prime Minister always asks as to what we  have done during the last 60 years?  I would like to tell him that during the last 60  years, we have enhanced literacy rate, life expectancy, irrigated lands, production  of foodgrains, production of milk, road construction, construction of rail lines,  establishment of colleges and so many things and we have also reduced the infant  mortality rate. Besides, we have also developed so many projects under the Five  Year Plans.  This Government has abolished the Planning Commission.  NITI  Ayog has become a superficial institution. We have established several public  sector undertakings to create jobs and also launched satellite like Aryabhatt.  In the  year 1974, India had conducted a peaceful atomic test. Congress Party has  enhanced the GDP of this country almost 33 times during the last 60 years.  It was  claimed that demonetization would eradicate corruption but poor people suffered a  lot due to demonetization.  Farmers too have suffered a lot due to demonetization.   During the year 2011-12, the rate of unemployment was 3.8 per cent whereas as  per the survey of NSSO, this rate has been increased to 6.1 per cent during the year  2017-18.  According to the data of NSSO, the unemployment rate of rural youth  was 5 per cent in the year 2011-12 which has increased to 17.4 per cent in the year  2017-18.  The rate of unemployment among rural women was 4.8 per cent which  has increased to 13.6 per cent.  Unemployment has increased in almost every  sector.  Trade has been badly affected due to frequent changes in the GST rates.   We have raised the issue of Rafael deal in this House several times but we have got  no reply.  I would like to request the Government to constitute a Joint  Parliamentary Committee in this regard. Growth rate in agriculture sector has come  down.  When this Government can waive the loan of Rs. one lakh ten thousand  crore to benefit corporate sector then why do they not waive the farmers‟ loan?   There is a huge scam in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana.  We had electrified  6,32,000 villages during the last 60 years.  The law and order situation in the  country has deteriorated. The prices of petrol and diesel kept falling in the  international market but the Government did not reduce the price.  This  Government has failed to bring the Women Reservation Bill and also reduced the  allocation for MNREGA upto 14 per cent.  Hon. President in his Address did not  utter even a single word about „Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao‟.  The Government has  put the Lokpal Bill in cold storage.  This Government has only altered the names  of old schemes. This Government claims to have launched new schemes but after  little scrutiny we find that all schemes are old ones and they have changed the  names only.  When Baba Saheb Ambedkar handed over the Constitution to the  nation, he had said that no man can be grateful at the cost of his honour and no  nation can be grateful at the cost of its liberty.

Steps should be  taken for industrial package for Uttarakhand. I request that while allocating  resources, we should be at par with the North-Eastern States. It is my request that  an economic package should be announced for integrated development of entire  Kedar valley and other disaster affected areas. Along with announcing loan  waivers for the farmers, special steps should be taken to revive the tourism  industry in this area. Uttarakhand has great potential for medicinal education and  research. Establishment of medicinal education and research institute in IDPL  premises will prove to be a milestone. A Herb Research Institute should be  established in Haridwar region. Urgent establishment of the Himalaya Studies  Center in the country is absolute necessity. I urge the Government to construct  Iqbalpur canal in Haridwar district of my Parliamentary Constituency. In view of  the sensitivity of all the Himalayan States, additional battalions of Eco Task Force  should be set up immediately. Local citizens, forest panchayats, voluntary  organizations should be included in awareness activities of Eco Task Force.  International Ganga Museum should be established in Haridwar.

Instead of  waiving off loans of the farmers, the Government in the Budget announced that it  would give Rs.17 a day.  How does Rs.6000 a year help a farmer who is in a debt  trap and contemplating suicide?  Farmers' income in Andhra Pradesh has doubled  in the last four years.  The agriculture growth rate is 11 per cent against the  national average of just two per cent.    The PM boasted that he would create two  crore jobs a year but as many as five lakh Government jobs are lying vacant in  various departments.  According to NSSO's latest job survey, unemployment rate is  at 40 year high at 6.1 per cent.  Now, NITI Aayog is trying to push this Report  under the carpet because of upcoming elections and to cover up the failure of the  Government.  This Regime is openly embarking on a path of cultural nationalism  and wishes to define a single national identity and culture for  India.

How will the State Governments bear the fiscal burden?     Where will the money come from?    Telangana launched the Rythu Bandhu  Programme, it has triggered a chain reaction amongst States to announce similar or  improved versions of financial aids.   Odisha has launched an economic package.   Instead of waiver, Odisha has announced a package of Rs.180 crore for three years.     Now the Union Government has announced Rs.6000 per year to a family having  up to two hectares of cultivable land.  No doubt, it is a welcome step.  But this  direct income support cannot be a permanent solution.  The actual solution lies in  fixing the Minimum Support Price.  I regret to mention that there is no mention of  revisiting the determination of MSP.    Gujarat and Maharashtra have low  concentration of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe population, while UP and  the eastern coastal States like Odisha have high concentration which need 90 per  cent support in education and other Centrally sponsored schemes.

If some investigating agency or any other agency abuses that power, what steps  would be taken against that person under this law?  In a criminal case, unless  consent in writing is given, nothing can be taken and if the investigating agency  wants to take it, they have to make an application.  But how a civil dispute would  be covered?  Therefore, immigration authority will be having the excessive power  to collect the DNA which is not your object.  Then come many other cases.  In a  case of medical negligence, how will DNA come into that?  There is an issue  relating to abandoned children and disputed children.

A civil matter comes when there is a dispute about the parentage  and a child is claimed by different people.

Neither these people  could be detected properly nor we could deport these illegal migrants.  The  indigenous people of Assam are in a very pathetic condition.  They have lost their  land rights.

Steep rise in population of the migrant  families is the root cause for dwindling Hindu population in the State of Assam.  I  believe that this Bill will provide safeguard to the Assamese people and also help  the already dwindling population of the Assamese people.

1472,SHRI ANANDRAO ADSUL,"Today 124th Constitutional (amendment)  Bill has been introduced in this House. This Bill has been introduced with an  objective to provide 10 percent reservation to the economically weaker section of  the society. Besides caste and religion, economic disparity has been also made the  basis of reservation, which is a right basis for reservation. When the SC/ST/OBCs  and economically backward sections get opportunities in Education and  employment through reservation, they achieve success and respect socially,  economically. When we try to take a view in our society we find that besides  SC/ST/OBC there is a class of people who are economically weaker, so they are  backward educationally, socially and economically. We have introduced 10  percent reservation for people belonging to economically weaker sections. This is a  just a new starting. There is a good provision in this Bill that people will get  admission in Higher Education be it Government or Private, caste based, aided or  unaided Institutions. We should provide new employment opportunities of about  two crores, which we have not been able to do in reality. Somewhere people have  lost their jobs due to demonitisation. GST has also affected job opportunities.  Previously there was 50% reservation. 10 percent has been introduced now. For  economically weaker sections here is 60% reservation. So whether they belong to  SC/ST/OBC community they will also get this benefit.

There is a large section in general category also which needs some  support.  The welfare of the poor from general category should also be taken into  concern.  The Government has given the benefit of reservation to the poor general  category without reducing anyone's reservation even by one per cent.  Such poor  can be from any castes of general category.
