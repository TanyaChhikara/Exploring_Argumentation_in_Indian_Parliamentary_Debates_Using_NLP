We are concerned about those medical students who have come back from  Ukraine.  The attack on Ukraine by Russia is a disastrous step.  Nearly 3,000 civilians  have been killed or injured in this war.  The cost of direct damage to Ukraine\\u201fs  infrastructure amid Russia\\u201fs ongoing invasion has reached almost an estimated figure of  63 billion dollars.  We expected that the war would be stopped.  But it did not.  India\\u201fs  responsibility was aimed at evacuating the Indian citizens from Ukraine and it did so.  It  was a good step.  We can initiate dialogue to end the war.  \",\n          \"Unfortunately, for India, since  1947, we have focussed a lot on the Western front, but we have not spoken even a  little bit about the Eastern front.  The incidents which have been taking place in our  country are still taking place even after 1947 till date.  After independence in 1947  two more nations have been formed in this country.  What is the condition of  Hindus there.  The estimates shows that the Hindus which were 15 per cent earlier  has been reduced upto 0.72 per cent in one country and in the other it has been  reduced upto 7 per cent.  This is the reason for bringing this legislation.  In the year  1901, the population of Muslims in Assam was 12.4 per cent and this has been  increased upto 34.22 per cent in the year 2011.  This is a huge increase and this is  how democratic dividends are being sought.  It is nothing but vote bank politics  and appeasement which is going on in the country.  There is difference between  legal migration, illegal migration and migration due to economic policies.  If you  follow social media, you will find that how the infiltration is still going on and this  is actually harmful to the secular fabric of this country because attempt is to  constantly get focus away from western border and ISI and such activities are  involved in getting this migration done.  This is the reason by which these  activities are taking place from eastern border from Assam to Bangladesh.   That is  why demography is changing there.\",\n          \"The Supreme Court had pronounced the talaq- e-biddat as unconstitutional.  A number of other judgments delivered by the  various courts of our country are also there which have pronounced this practice as  unconstitutional.  But, there is not a single judgment where it has been said that the  Government should make the talaq-e-biddat a criminal offence. It clearly  demonstrates that the purpose of this Government is to demonize and penalize the  Muslim men.  The Government should have provided protection to the Muslim  women by bringing them under the ambit of the Domestic Violence Act, 2005.

We are concerned about those medical students who have come back from  Ukraine.  The attack on Ukraine by Russia is a disastrous step.  Nearly 3,000 civilians  have been killed or injured in this war.  The cost of direct damage to Ukraine\\u201fs  infrastructure amid Russia\\u201fs ongoing invasion has reached almost an estimated figure of  63 billion dollars.  We expected that the war would be stopped.  But it did not.  India\\u201fs  responsibility was aimed at evacuating the Indian citizens from Ukraine and it did so.  It  was a good step.  We can initiate dialogue to end the war.  \",\n          \"Unfortunately, for India, since  1947, we have focussed a lot on the Western front, but we have not spoken even a  little bit about the Eastern front.  The incidents which have been taking place in our  country are still taking place even after 1947 till date.  After independence in 1947  two more nations have been formed in this country.  What is the condition of  Hindus there.  The estimates shows that the Hindus which were 15 per cent earlier  has been reduced upto 0.72 per cent in one country and in the other it has been  reduced upto 7 per cent.  This is the reason for bringing this legislation.  In the year  1901, the population of Muslims in Assam was 12.4 per cent and this has been  increased upto 34.22 per cent in the year 2011.  This is a huge increase and this is  how democratic dividends are being sought.  It is nothing but vote bank politics  and appeasement which is going on in the country.  There is difference between  legal migration, illegal migration and migration due to economic policies.  If you  follow social media, you will find that how the infiltration is still going on and this  is actually harmful to the secular fabric of this country because attempt is to  constantly get focus away from western border and ISI and such activities are  involved in getting this migration done.  This is the reason by which these  activities are taking place from eastern border from Assam to Bangladesh.   That is  why demography is changing there.\",\n          \"The Supreme Court had pronounced the talaq- e-biddat as unconstitutional.  A number of other judgments delivered by the  various courts of our country are also there which have pronounced this practice as  unconstitutional.  But, there is not a single judgment where it has been said that the  Government should make the talaq-e-biddat a criminal offence. It clearly  demonstrates that the purpose of this Government is to demonize and penalize the  Muslim men.  The Government should have provided protection to the Muslim  women by bringing them under the ambit of the Domestic Violence Act, 2005.

Nearly 3,000 civilians  have been killed or injured in this war.  The cost of direct damage to Ukraine\\u201fs  infrastructure amid Russia\\u201fs ongoing invasion has reached almost an estimated figure of  63 billion dollars.  We expected that the war would be stopped.  But it did not.  India\\u201fs  responsibility was aimed at evacuating the Indian citizens from Ukraine and it did so.  It  was a good step.  We can initiate dialogue to end the war.  \",\n          \"Unfortunately, for India, since  1947, we have focussed a lot on the Western front, but we have not spoken even a  little bit about the Eastern front.  The incidents which have been taking place in our  country are still taking place even after 1947 till date.  After independence in 1947  two more nations have been formed in this country.  What is the condition of  Hindus there.  The estimates shows that the Hindus which were 15 per cent earlier  has been reduced upto 0.72 per cent in one country and in the other it has been  reduced upto 7 per cent.  This is the reason for bringing this legislation.  In the year  1901, the population of Muslims in Assam was 12.4 per cent and this has been  increased upto 34.22 per cent in the year 2011.  This is a huge increase and this is  how democratic dividends are being sought.  It is nothing but vote bank politics  and appeasement which is going on in the country.  There is difference between  legal migration, illegal migration and migration due to economic policies.  If you  follow social media, you will find that how the infiltration is still going on and this  is actually harmful to the secular fabric of this country because attempt is to  constantly get focus away from western border and ISI and such activities are  involved in getting this migration done.  This is the reason by which these  activities are taking place from eastern border from Assam to Bangladesh.   That is  why demography is changing there.\",\n          \"The Supreme Court had pronounced the talaq- e-biddat as unconstitutional.  A number of other judgments delivered by the  various courts of our country are also there which have pronounced this practice as  unconstitutional.  But, there is not a single judgment where it has been said that the  Government should make the talaq-e-biddat a criminal offence. It clearly  demonstrates that the purpose of this Government is to demonize and penalize the  Muslim men.  The Government should have provided protection to the Muslim  women by bringing them under the ambit of the Domestic Violence Act, 2005.

is actually harmful to the secular fabric of this country because attempt is to  constantly get focus away from western border and isi and such activities are  involved in getting this migration done.
