We are concerned about those medical students who have come back from  Ukraine.  The attack on Ukraine by Russia is a disastrous step.  Nearly 3,000 civilians  have been killed or injured in this war.  The cost of direct damage to Ukraine\\u201fs  infrastructure amid Russia\\u201fs ongoing invasion has reached almost an estimated figure of  63 billion dollars.  We expected that the war would be stopped.  But it did not.  India\\u201fs  responsibility was aimed at evacuating the Indian citizens from Ukraine and it did so.  It  was a good step.  We can initiate dialogue to end the war.  \",\n          \"Unfortunately, for India, since  1947, we have focussed a lot on the Western front, but we have not spoken even a  little bit about the Eastern front.  The incidents which have been taking place in our  country are still taking place even after 1947 till date.  After independence in 1947  two more nations have been formed in this country.  What is the condition of  Hindus there.  The estimates shows that the Hindus which were 15 per cent earlier  has been reduced upto 0.72 per cent in one country and in the other it has been  reduced upto 7 per cent.  This is the reason for bringing this legislation.  In the year  1901, the population of Muslims in Assam was 12.4 per cent and this has been  increased upto 34.22 per cent in the year 2011.  This is a huge increase and this is  how democratic dividends are being sought.  It is nothing but vote bank politics  and appeasement which is going on in the country.  There is difference between  legal migration, illegal migration and migration due to economic policies.  If you  follow social media, you will find that how the infiltration is still going on and this  is actually harmful to the secular fabric of this country because attempt is to  constantly get focus away from western border and ISI and such activities are  involved in getting this migration done.  This is the reason by which these  activities are taking place from eastern border from Assam to Bangladesh.   That is  why demography is changing there.\",\n          \"The Supreme Court had pronounced the talaq- e-biddat as unconstitutional.  A number of other judgments delivered by the  various courts of our country are also there which have pronounced this practice as  unconstitutional.  But, there is not a single judgment where it has been said that the  Government should make the talaq-e-biddat a criminal offence. It clearly  demonstrates that the purpose of this Government is to demonize and penalize the  Muslim men.  The Government should have provided protection to the Muslim  women by bringing them under the ambit of the Domestic Violence Act, 2005.   We, therefore, demand that the Government should bring this Bill in a  constitutionally appropriate manner.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 55,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Tuesday, August 6, 2019\",\n          \"Monday, February 5, 2024\",\n          \"Monday, August 5, 2019\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Oath\",\n          \"Union Budget\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Gender\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"F\",\n          \"M\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Party\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 38,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jan Adhikar Party\",\n          \"SDF\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Call For Action\",\n          \"Blame\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":15}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.Category.unique()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"YzR17jJMeO-n","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710795614716,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"045_Punerva Singh","userId":"02056743895864260867"}},"outputId":"4d7a8f00-2731-48c0-ac3d-1b4ff97ff201"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["array(['Issue', 'Call For Action', 'Appreciate', 'Neutral', 'Blame'],\n","      dtype=object)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":16}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df['Category'].value_counts()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"HvhTZmv9gAQp","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710795615092,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1,"user":{"displayName":"045_Punerva Singh","userId":"02056743895864260867"}},"outputId":"0d3c3fcf-605a-49b6-9fe5-077fa995dcb5"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["Appreciate         343\n","Call For Action    326\n","Issue              243\n","Blame              155\n","Neutral            121\n","Name: Category, dtype: int64"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":17}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["combined_speeches = df.groupby('Category')['Speech'].apply(' '.join).reset_index()"],"metadata":{"id":"ZUBhg30_hSMZ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["combined_speeches"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"YmDgYXV1hWaL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710795618280,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2095,"user":{"displayName":"045_Punerva Singh","userId":"02056743895864260867"}},"outputId":"dbf4387d-64cd-4223-e192-6bc9777607a1"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["          Category                                             Speech\n","0       Appreciate  Lord Ram is a symbol of dignity.

I wonder how  Lok Sabha can speak in different voices. The Lok Sabha should speak in one voice.  Is this Government a Government of one community or one religion or is it the  Government of the people of all religions of the country? I believe this country has  no religion. I respect Maryada Purushottam Ram. Today, India's 17 crore Muslims  are taking themselves to be  strangers and alienated. I will never believe in false and  deceitful things now and will  continue to work within the ambit of the Constitution.  When the Prime Minister replies, will he speak for 140 crore people of India or will  he reply only to  those who care about Hindutva? Let me stand as a tall Indian  Muslim and say that the light of Indian democracy is at its dimmest today.   I would like to highlight the status of  the Indian economy since the pre-Independence era. After we got our Independence  in 1947 from British rule, India\\u2019s GDP was only about one per cent of the world\\u2019s  GDP. Our Government at that time faced the biggest challenge of nation-building.  Many things had to be taken care of. Poverty was the biggest threat to our nation at  that point in time. The Green Revolution and White Revolution were focused upon  to improve agricultural production and milk production. In 1991, the economy of the  country opened up and improved under the capable leadership of the then Prime  Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao and the Finance Minister Dr Manmohan Singh.  After assuming office, our Hon. Prime Minister promised that two crore jobs would  be offered to people every year and that the prices of gas and petrol would be halved.  Adding further it was also claimed that the exchange rate of the US dollar would be  reduced but even after ten years today there is no mention of these things in the  White Paper presented  by the Government. It does not find mention of  demonetization, its effects and achievements. All the opposition parties have been  asking for the same. The whole exercise of demonetization seems futile as there is  no mention of the same. This Government has only increased the cess throughout  the country since 2014. Over the last two years, the Government has imposed  windfall tax on oil companies. This windfall tax is for making excessive profits and  it has been informed that the cost of petrol and diesel is now market-driven and not  under their control. The Government claims to have alleviated 25 crore people out  of poverty but it is far from the truth. During the COVID period, eighty crore people  had to be provided free rations which is something commendable. Now after that  pandemic is over, the same promise has been repeated for the next five years. The  dependence of 80 crore people, which accounts for  55 per cent of the country's  population, on free ration for sustenance is a sad state of affairs. With reference to  the scams highlighted by the Hon. Minister, I would like to ask the Government why  no action had been taken by the present Government during their rule for ten years.  The Government is only interested in making accusations against the Opposition. A  Commission should have been set up to inquire into the CAG report to bring out the  truth.  Our party is of the opinion that before the next  Lok Sabha general elections, the game of making serious allegations and counter- allegations and proving each other wrong and anti-people by issuing black papers  and white papers between the Congress Party and the BJP is nothing but selfishness.  How can the country, public interest and public welfare be possible through such  narrow politics? Today, crores of people of the country are constantly suffering from  stressful life due to high inflation, immense poverty, unemployment, plight of  farmers and plight of rural India etc. It is very important for all political parties to  give up selfishness and hatred etc. and make a united effort on the most pressing  national problems of the country. The correct assessment of the policy and activities  of every Government depends on the better livelihood of the people and their  happiness and happy life. The record of both the Congress and BJP Governments in  this matter is neither remarkable nor commendable. If the record of UPA's 10-year  tenure had been excellent then BJP would not have got a chance to come to power  in the country. Similarly, if the tenure of the present Government in the last 10 years  had been excellent in terms of public interest, public welfare, national interest, social  and religious harmony, peace and order etc., then crores of people would  have  never  been so troubled and miserable in every sphere of life. Lack of expected  increase in the per capita income of the people of the country, big capitalists  becoming more prosperous, SC, ST and OBC reservations being made inactive and  ineffective and no significant reduction in corruption in common life, are some of  the issues for public interest. There are specific issues which continue to disturb  people and which are diverting the country from its ambitious objective of equitable  and welfare development. It would have been good if the development of the  country's economy had been employment-oriented rather than employment-free and  the benefits of this development would have been available to all sections of the  society. I demand that the way you have honoured Karpoori Thakur ji with Bharat  Ratna, in the same way if you honour Shri Kanshi Ram with Bharat Ratna then crores  of Dalits, backward classes, Muslims, people of all sections of the society will  be  happy. This white paper is not a white paper but an  election stunt. This is an attempt to hide all the failures of the government. It is  regrettable that the order for the release of a drug-related criminal in Manipur comes  from the Chief Minister's office. Another report came regarding the Ayushman  Bharat scheme as to what kind of corruption is happening in Ayushman Bharat  today. The audit noted that around 7.5 lakh beneficiaries were registered against the  same mobile number and no verification was done. Claims are being filed in the  name of 90 thousand people who have died. No action is being taken on that. Today  ED has become another arm of BJP. ED's job is to catch the corrupt. But today ED  is their special weapon to suppress democracy and the voice of opposition and how  to include corrupt people in the BJP. Had they allowed ED to work, it would have  caught all the people who have absconded abroad today. There are about 31 people  abroad who owe a debt of Rs 40 thousand crore, but today ED is not  apprehending them. If the Prime Minister is so powerful in the world then why does  he not bring back these people hiding abroad? The average GDP growth in UPA was 6.8  per cent whereas the average GDP growth in this Government has reached to 5.9 per  cent. The Fiscal Deficit as a Percentage of GDP was 4.7 percent during the tenure of  UPA whereas during this Government, it remained 5.1 percent average. Inflation  was 8 percent in the UPA Government whereas, it was 5 percent in this Government,  but is it not true that the global oil prices between 2008 and 2014 were more than  100 dollars per barrel, while the prices of oil between 2015 to 2021 were in the range  of $ 55 and $ 70. If GDP was 5.9 percent during the NDA regime, then what about  the rate of unemployment? Why has the Prime Minister not undertaken an  employment survey since 2011? The consumption survey has not been conducted  since 2017. The dollar was at Rs 43 during the year 2005, while it reached to Rs 83  during 2014. How did it reach to $ 83? There is a net increase of 40 rupees. The  foreign currency reserve was at $ 294 billion in 2011. By the year 2013, it rose to  256 billion. Health expenditure from pocket which was 69 percent in the year 2005  has increased to 64.2 percent in the year 2014. In the White Paper at least you give  the data for the year 2020. This white paper is more rhetoric than substantive. Make  a White Paper showing the number of Muslims including Akhlaq who were mob  lynched during the years 2014 to 2024. How many houses were demolished by  bulldozers? Finally, during the UPA regime, there was provision of free coaching in  minorities budget, which they have stopped. They closed the Maulana Azad  Foundation, they stopped the Maulana Azad Fellowship. They have abolished  Madrasa education. During 2014 there was a Muslim Minister, now there is none. This White Paper was a  comparison of two Government tenures of a decade of each. There was nothing but  allegations against the previous Government.  This White Paper is not a White Paper.  It is a politically coloured paper. The unemployment rate during UPA was 2.2 per  cent, while during the present Government, it is 6.6. per cent. The average GDP  growth rate during the previous Government was 8.13 percent which is 5.6 percent  now. Regarding the fiscal deficit data, if you take the entire tenures together, the  fiscal deficit during Dr. Manmohan Singh Ji\\u2019s Government was 4.48 percent while  during this  Government it was 5.8 per cent. Jan Dhan was a product which was  started earlier and there were 34 crore bank accounts. Eventually, they took it to 51  crore accounts which is not a great achievement. Average expenditure during the  UPA Government was 14.68 per cent of the GDP while during this Government it  was 12.94 per cent. They always say that spending has gone up which is not the case.  Be it education and health care during the earlier Government, if you comparatively  take the cumulative figure, the budget outlay of the whole year, the spending on  health care and education is much lesser now than it used to be before. They have  started a cashless economy that they wanted to and they have started a digital  economy. In the digital sphere, you know what has happened to Paytm. It is almost  like money laundering through Paytm. So, what is the Government doing for the  economy? There is a Bhim app now. The Bhim app is hardly used by people. The  IT Committee report has already flagged this. So, these are very serious concerns.  Let us do something constructive and serve this nation.  This is a white paper related to the dark  clouds that have been hovering around the country for ten years and there is no  mention of demonetization, the loss of the economy, the foreign policy of the  country, China's continuous intrusion inside the country, the misuse of ED in it. In  the tribal-dominated state of Jharkhand, an attempt was made to forcibly bring down  a tribal Chief Minister. Executive, Income Tax, CBI, and ED have been grossly  misused in ten years. They have failed to meet the promises they made before 2014.  They are ending the reservation given to SC, ST, and OBC in lieu of atrocities done  on them for thousands of years through privatization. The Government is  manipulating to award of contracts, tenders etc to their favourites and they are calling  themselves corruption-free. The Government is running because of ED, CBI and  Income Tax, otherwise, they do not have the strength to fight with any party. This Amendment law brought in the House is  regarding water pollution. If we talk about air pollution, then India is also included in  the world's 10 most toxic cities, wherein even breathing is risking life. Among the 122  countries across the world where water pollution is a sensitive issue, India ranks 120  out of 122 countries. Even in Assam, our Central Pollution Control Board has  mentioned that out of 10 rivers, there are 11 very polluted stretches. untreated waste,  whether from industry or our homes, is getting dumped into our rivers every day. You  have spent around Rs 12,000 crore on 'Namami Gange'. There are many tanneries,  chemical industries, slaughterhouses, textile industries, etc. on the banks of the  Mother Ganga River. These industries also want to clean up their industry emissions  and for that, they need support that includes funds, credits and technology. Will the  Central Government provide assistance to such small and medium-scale industries? At  the same time, I also would like to ask the Government that how vigilantly it will  monitor the big industries regarding water pollution. We are neither making any rules  nor listing categories. We demand that more details should be included in the bill. We  would like to ask why there is no mention of the State Government in this Bill. If you  want to exempt, do so, if you want to issue a gazette notification then do so, but do so  after consultation with the state government. Today, in our country, due to ever  increasing population, further urbanization will also take place. Keeping this problem  in mind, you should have brought a strong law and not the feeble one that you are  bringing. I rise here to speak on the Interim Budget  2024-25. Since 2014, we all have been listening to \\u2018Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas\\u2019. I want  to ask one thing to the hon. Finance Minister. Whose \\u2018Vikas\\u2019 are you talking about?   Let me be very clear that you are not definitely talking about the \\u2018Vikas\\u2019 of the  farmers.  In this Budget, under major Union schemes, funds for the Formation and  Promotion of 10,000 Farmer Producer Organisations have been slashed by 39 per  cent. The Finance Minister talked about Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana in her  speech but ended up reducing the amount for this scheme by 21 per cent as compared  to the last year.  In West Bengal, the Chief Minister has tripled the farmers\\u2019 income. I  will remind the Finance Minister about the funds which are still due to the State of  West Bengal. Funds for the Regional Connectivity Scheme, AMRUT Scheme, and  Smart City Mission have been slashed by 60 per cent to 35 per cent. In the Ministry of  Civil Aviation, funds have been slashed to 26 per cent.  We used to buy rice and  wheat at Rs. 24 per kg and 15 per kg. Now it is Rs. 42 per kg and 28 per kg  respectively. There is a BJP Government in 80 percent of states but there are no  women Chief Minister or Women Finance Minister in any of them.  ADV. A. M. ARIFF:  Before going into the details of the Budget, I would  like to ask a few pertinent questions about the claims that India will become the third  largest economy in the world soon and our economic growth will be 7.5 per cent in  2023-24. Why is the vibrant growth claimed not by the Government reflected in the  lives of the common people of this country?  The common people are made to suffer  by the increase in the prices of cooking gas as well as essential commodities.  The  price of subsidized domestic LPG cylinders has increased to Rs. 1000.  The petrol  prices are the highest in the world while five per cent own more than 60 per cent of  the country\\u2019s wealth, the bottom 50 per cent possess only three per cent. I would like  to raise a pertinent issue regarding neglect towards the non-BJP-ruled States of the  country including Kerala. Karnataka, Kerala, Telangana and Tamil Nadu States are  suffering at the hands of the Union Government. Instead of supporting the State  Governments by giving their due share, the Government is squeezing them. The  devolution of Central taxes has been drastically reduced from 3.875 per cent to 1.9 per  cent. The Hon'ble Finance Minister in her Budget  Speech has just made a blank hypothesis of  social justice as inclusive, all-embracing  and all-inclusive, which implies that   development  covers people belonging to  all  spheres of life.  Universalisation  of education in  the entire society in a  country  is  important for the all-round development of a nation.  In the field of  education,  the seats reserved for the students  belonging to SC / ST and OBC in Kashi  Hindu University  have not been filled by the candidates of those categories by just  putting the tag of an NFS (not found suitable) in these categories and filling  these  vacancies with the candidates of the general category shows hollowness of the  meaningful initiatives taken by the present government in the interests of SC / ST and  OBC students coming under reservation.  About 10 lakh posts are vacant in central  government ministries and departments. The government should provide employment  to the unemployed by taking measures to fill the vacant posts at the earliest. The target  of self-reliant India will be achieved  only when 80 crore countrymen, who are being  provided ration by the government, will get proper employment and jobs.  I request  the government to provide housing to the landless by allotting leases of government  land at the level of Municipal Corporation, Nagar Palika, Nagar Panchayat and Gram  Panchayat so that homeless people can also get houses.  Anganwadi workers/helpers  should be given the status full of  government employees. The central government is  repeatedly ignoring the interests of farmers. I would like to draw attention to the toll  plazas situated on the National Highway and State Highways in my  district and Lok  Sabha constituency,  Bijnor, that toll is already proposed on NH-34 for traffic going  from Najibabad to  Bijnor.  Traffic from Bijnor to Dhampur via NH-734 and NH-709  AD, is already toll  being collected between Kotwali to Dhampur. This  is a two-lane  road used predominantly  by the farmers and local residents of the area. As per the  NHAI policy, all local residents within a radius of 10 km are exempted from toll  charges. Then why the government is still wasting money on the construction of a toll  plaza between Bijnor Kotwali Road? Therefore, I request  to kindly stop the  construction of the toll plaza being built between Bijnor to Kotwali without delay in  the interest of farmers and local residents. The Finance Minister discussed  agriculture and food processing, emphasising the intensified efforts for value addition  to the agricultural sector and raising farmers\\u2019 income. However, the upcoming year's  allocation for this scheme is only Rs 729 crore, marking a 21 percent decrease against  last year's Budget estimates. The Government should consider increasing the financial  assistance allocated to this pivotal scheme. I request the Central Government not to  reduce the allocation of fertilizers for coastal regions that have suffered the brunt of  the cyclones. The Labour Ministry has seen a decreased allocation from Rs. 13,221.73  crore to Rs. 12,531.47 crore. Unemployment is the biggest harm facing the youth of  today. Significant investment needs to be made for employment generation. The  Budgetary allocation of Rs 538 crore for the Centre's Capacity Building and Skill  Development scheme does not seem adequate. Application of Artificial Intelligence is  on the rise, and unfortunately, it is being weaponized against women. It is regrettably  being done via deep fakes, among other reprehensible acts. Higher budgetary  allocation is required to deal with such new threats. The Andhra Pradesh Government  has consistently sought an increase in MGNREGA man-days, proposing an  augmentation from 100 to 150 days for individuals and a total of 16 crore man-days.  Given the prevailing drought conditions leading to rural migration, the State urges the  Central Government to support its economy by enhancing MGNREGA man-hours  and incorporating new initiatives under the scheme. I urge the Government to  formulate and implement a time-bound plan for granting special category status to  Andhra Pradesh promptly, providing the necessary support to address the unfair losses  incurred due to illogical bifurcation. The Polavaram Irrigation Project is a project of  national importance and it is of huge importance for the people of Andhra Pradesh.  The total cost of the project is Rs.55,548.87 crores at the 2017-18 price level as  approved by the Technical Advisory Committee. However, this Revised Cost  Estimate is not yet approved by the Central Government. Further, funding for Phase-1  completion has been limited to Rs.12,911.15 crore but this amount is inadequate for  providing rehabilitation and resettlement to the 36 additional villages and 48  habitations. Hence, the Andhra Pradesh Government submitted a proposal of Revised  Cost Estimates of Rs.17,144.06 crore for Phase-1 of the project which includes the  cost of such rehabilitation as well. It is requested that the Revised Cost Estimate be  approved by the Technical Advisory Committee and the Revised Cost Estimate for  Phase-1 and provide compensation of  the additional cost of Rs.4222.91 crore incurred  by the Andhra Pradesh Government for resettlement and rehabilitation. Production  activities in all NTC mills were suspended from March 2020 due to the COVID-19  pandemic. The Central Government should take immediate action to make the NTC  mill in Tirupati fully functional to provide relief and support to the BPL families  through its operations. In the Rajya Sabha recently, the Hon. Education  Minister said that 32 thousand students dropped out of higher education midway, out  of which 52 percent of students belong to the SC, ST and OBC categories. It is a very  serious matter. I demand that Dalit, exploited, backward and vulnerable people may  be enrolled on zero balance and efforts need to be taken to educate them. According to  the statement of the present Government, lakhs of youth have been offered  Government jobs in mission mode, but it has remained just an election Jumla. Nearly  10 lakh posts are lying vacant in the Union Ministries and Departments. As on March  1, 2021, only 30.55 lakh employees are working against 40.35 lakh sanctioned posts.  The Government should take measures to fill these vacancies at the earliest and  provide employment to the unemployed. The Government says that arrangements  have been made to provide free ration to 80 crore countrymen. If you work to give  free ration to 80 crore people in this country,  it shows the scale of  unemployment in  our country. You are not giving employment to a poor person, but you are doing the  work of giving ration to him/her. If the Government talks about making an Atma  Nirbhar Bharat,  provide a Government job to the families of these 80 crore people  based on  their qualifications. The Government introduced the Pradhan  Mantri Awas  Yojana. If the Government  wants to make this scheme a reality, landless people ought  to be given  residential leases on  the Government owned land in the Municipal  Corporation, Nagar Palika, and Nagar Panchayats, and work on making them part of  the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. There is also a mention of women empowerment.  In this context, I would like to say that 44,5256 cases related to atrocities against  women have been registered in the year 2022,  meaning thereby  about 51 FIRs per  hour. This makes us think that the Government has failed to protect women. The  Government has arranged Ayushman cards for Anganwadi workers. It is a good  initiative of the Government but their honorarium is very low.  By affording them the  status of Government servants, the Government can certainly offer them a dignified  life. The Government repeatedly ignores the interests of the farmers. According to the  recent NCRB data, the highest numbers of 12,227 suicides have been committed by  farmers and agricultural workers in Maharashtra, due to loss of crops, loss of land and    non-repayment of loans, etc. Therefore, it is very sad and concerning to ignore the  lives of the people reeling under poverty, unemployment, inflation, etc. I would like to  draw your attention to the toll plazas situated on the National Highway in Bijnor and  Nagina parliamentary constituency in my home district. A free toll is already proposed  for vehicles plying from Bijnor via NH-34. It is a two-lane road used by farmers and  local residents of the area. No commercial vehicle passes through this road. According  to the NHAI, all local residents within a radius of 10 km have been exempted from  toll, yet why is the government wasting money on the construction of a toll plaza  between Bijnor and Kotwali Road? I request you to kindly stop the construction of the  toll plaza between Bijnor and Kotwali. By using new words and  technologies, our Finance Minister has presented this confusing and misleading  budget, which is a gimmick in itself. It has been mentioned that the Government is  providing food grains free of cost to 80 crore people in this country. It means the  Finance Minister has accepted that 80 crore people are still living below the poverty  line. A few years ago, the Finance Minister mentioned that we are going to become a  five trillion dollar economy very soon. I do not know whether we have achieved that  target or not. The Finance Minister has mentioned that our total tax collection has  increased threefold during these years. Then why are people still languishing in abject  poverty? The MUDRA scheme was launched and our young boys and girls  approached banks to get the benefits of this scheme. But later the banks stopped  providing MUDRA loans to the poor and needy youths of this country. We often talk  about 'Annadaata', our farmers. However, we do not take any initiative to ensure MSP  for farmers. In my state Maharashtra, our soybean, cotton and pigeon pea-growing  farmers are distressed and they are not getting remunerative prices any more. The  export of soybeans is banned by the Government and they are importing it. So, all the  soybean, cotton etc. producing farmers are facing acute problems. I would like to  request the Union Government to fix MSP. To ensure tele-connectivity and also to  improve the telecommunication network, around 25000 4G towers had to be installed.  But it has not been installed till date in my constituency. Konkan Railway is our pride  and honour. It connects North India with South India. Konkan Railway is a  Government company. I would request the Union Government to dissolve the Konkan  Railway Corporation and acquire it as early as possible. Our per capita income is lesser than in  Bangladesh and Bhutan. Whereas in the case of states per capita income, Bihar is at  the last position.  The Government is targeting minorities and not taking care of the  well-being of Bihar. In the budget, educational schemes such as Skills development  and livelihood programmes are being pulled back. In AMU Kishanganj neither  teaching nor non-teaching staff is inducted nor are funds released.  My demand is to  stop the linking of Kosi and Mechi in the Mahananda basin. Border pitching and  concrete walls should be constructed on them and every year dredging should be done  to check floods. A Government medical college should be allotted to our district.  The  most backward community Surjapuri should be included in the OBC list. A train  should be started for Kishanganj and Seemanchal and attention should be paid to job  opportunities in this region. You claim that you have lifted 25 crore  people above the poverty line. You were giving free ration to 80 crore people, and you  have lifted 25 crore people above the poverty line. In this way, you are assuming that  105 crore people were poor within ten years. This is your achievement of ten years.  You promised that by March 2022, every homeless person in this country will get a  house and not only a house, there will be a tap in the house and there will be water in  the tap, but work on a single house has not even been started. You reduced the budget  of minorities by 38 percent. You have reduced the budget of madrasas. You have  reduced the pre-matric scholarship. You want Children of minorities, especially of  Muslims, should only set up tea stalls, make punctures, and drive auto rickshaws.  ASHA workers and Anganwadi workers agitate every few months. Those ASHA  workers get seven thousand rupees. Even after working hard, Anganwadi workers get  15 thousand rupees. The loans of big industrialists have been written off by the banks.  There are 3,330 government schools in my constituency Aurangabad which do not  have pucca roofs and these children study under tin sheds.  \\uf02aSHRI SUNIL DATTATRAY TATKARE: Under the able leadership of the  Prime Minister, this new Parliament Building has been constructed. Being a part of  NDA, today I rise to support and appreciate this Interim Budget. Our Prime Minister  performed wonderfully during the last ten years and that has helped to build  confidence and trust. Shrimati Nirmala Sitaraman ji has presented a very balanced and  progressive budget. Our government is focusing on infrastructure development and we  have constructed a 22 km long Setu. This coastal road infrastructure would also help  to connect the Agardanda-Turmadi, Vela-Diveagar, and Baghlan sea bridges too in  future. Through the Khelo India scheme, our government has promoted sports and  sportspersons in our country. Our economy is also growing at a fast pace and we are  one of the largest economies in the world. Through cooperative federalism, we are  moving forward and supporting our Maharashtra State. I am hopeful that Janjira Fort,  constructed by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, will be spared by the Archaeological  Survey of India and new development works will be carried out by our Government  by providing more funds. Under the leadership of Shri Eknath Shinde, we would be  there to support this Government and will carry forward the rich and varied heritage of  our Maharashtra for its overall development. I am hopeful that the Government will  definitely take steps to develop the 720 km long coastline of Maharashtra and bring  positive changes in the lives of fishermen.    This government has disappointed on  every front in the interim budget 2024-25. Input costs are increasing due to inflation,  and farmers' incomes are decreasing. The government has still not listened to the  demands of the farmers which shows that the government is not sensitive towards the  condition of farmers in the country. There is not even a single serious step taken by  the government to bring black money.  The government should bring a white paper on  the steps taken by the government to bring back black money. The budget fails to  address measures to check inflation and generate employment. It clearly reflects that  the slogan of \\\"Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas\\\" is a mirage for the marginalized groups in  the country. The unemployment rate is as high as 20% in a few states.  The  government is not concerned about the issues of the youth of the country. There is  nothing in this budget for the salaried middle class.  They don't even consider the  impact of household inflation and price rise on them. Rubber producers in Kerala are  not receiving adequate compensation for their products compared to the cost of  production.  I strongly urge the government to establish a minimum price of Rs 250  per kilogram for rubber. Compounded rubber (CR) will continue to be imported at nil  duty from ASEAN countries. There was not a word in the budget on the government's  intention to legalise minimum support price (MSP) or on providing guaranteed  income to farmers. The budget has nothing concrete about alternative energy, despite  the skyrocketing prices of CNG, petrol and diesel. This Government is adamant  enough not to provide any sort of financial relief to the common people. Viksit Bharat  is nothing but an amorphic idea being propagated by this government. The concept of  GeM is exorbitantly costly. On the Gem portal, the applicant or the aspirant has to pay  0.5 percent of the contracted amount. Due to the suspension of recruitment  notifications, the future of youths in the country is uncertain. I oppose the  government's Agniveer scheme. Agniveer will not get the status of martyr, he will not  get the pension, he will not get gratuity. They will not get any other facilities. The  total FDI inflow declined to 7.8 percent in the second quarter of 2023. Over 90  percent of the investment has been directed towards non-manufacturing sectors  despite the 'Make in India' initiative. The CAG reports have declared that this  Government is a failure in every sector. Flight delays persist as a prevalent issue in the  country, affecting air travel reliability. Jute producers operating in the country do not  get minimum support prices because procurement is not done. This golden fibre  should be promoted. The problem of erosion by rivers in my constituency should be  controlled by the centre and the state jointly.  THE MINISTRY OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE A paltry allocation has been made for the  Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) in the interim Union Budget 2024- 25, which is a matter of concern. The total allocation for the welfare of the SCs is Rs  1,65,598 crore and for the STs, Rs 1,21,023 crore; whereas, the total estimated  expenditure in the budget is Rs 51,08,780 crore. The funds under Pradhan Mantri Adi  Adarsh Gram Yojana were released for less than 40 percent of approved villages. This  results in setbacks to the scheme's objectives due to limited fund releases. The  allocation towards Venture capital for Dalits has been drastically reduced from Rs 70  crore to Rs 10 crore. Dalits, women and other marginalised sections of the society had  to face a strong wave of atrocities against them across the country.  It is evident that  allocations for crucial schemes related to skill development and livelihoods, as well as  the educational and social upliftment of minorities, have been reduced this time. In the  year 2023-24, the education scheme for madrasas and minorities was reduced by 93  per cent to Rs 10 crore as compared to the previous year. This time, it has been further  reduced to a mere Rs 2 crore. This time, the budget for the pre-matric scholarship for  minorities has been reduced to 326.16 crores. Further reductions in the funds and the  closure of many such schemes will be detrimental to the minorities in India. This  would harshly affect the participation and enrolment of students belonging to the  minority community, particularly girls and women. The actual disbursement of  incentives for LSEM PLI turned out to be only Rs 1,655 crore. The incentives  disbursed in the first two years amount to less than 2 percent of the total scheme  outlay. The current Government is talking about the  four strong pillars of developed India which are youth, women, farmers and poor  people but today, the youths of the country are unemployed. The youths is very  disappointed. MSME enterprises which are capable of providing employment are also  continuously declining. The people who are capable of providing employment are  leaving the country due to tax terrorism. Violence against women is continuously  increasing. India has the highest number of cases of wasting and stunting in babies.  Farmers are not being provided subsidies. Be it vegetables, milk, cylinder or petrol,  inflation is increasing. The Government is talking about IITs, Triple IITs, Universities  and AIIMS. AIIMS buildings are ready in Raebareli and Gorakhpur. But, the  Government is not capable of providing staff and equipment to the said AIIMS. This is fully an electoral budget. This  country has the highest taxation system and despite that, no social security efforts  have been made. Attempts have been made to plunge the country into debt with false  promises. The Government neither provided employment, petrol, or diesel nor  reduced the inflation but they burdened each person with the debt of more than one  lakh rupees. I think this budget is a non-sequitur. The  capitalists, the industrialists and the richer people will be happy in this budget. The  poor, the middle-class people, the farmers and labourers will fail to get rid of their  economic problems. There is no mention of unemployment and price hikes. The fund  of Awas Yojna has been stopped only for West Bengal. The money of different  central schemes is not given to West Bengal. On the other hand, the Hon\\u2019ble Chief  Minister of West Bengal has declared to give the wages of 21 lakhs 100 days workers  by 21st February 2024. I am protesting this budget because it is meaningless to the  poor and middle-class people. I stand to speak in support of  the Constitution (Jammu and Kashmir) Scheduled Castes Order (Amendment) Bill,  2023 and the Constitution (Jammu and Kashmir) Scheduled Tribes Order  (Amendment) Bill, 2023. In Maharashtra, farmers' agitation for loan waiver and  Maratha reservation is going on. The Bharatiya Janata Party had promised  reservation to the Dhangar community 10 years ago. The Lingayat Samaj, Muslim  Samaj, Bhamta, Ramoshi, Takari and those who are VJNTs want to be included  under ST. There was also a demand for reservation for Dhangar and Lingayat  communities from the state of Karnataka. If an inclusive Bill is brought for the  entire country, then every State will get justice. The Constitution (Jammu and  Kashmir) Scheduled Castes Order (Amendment) Bill, 2023 amends the  Constitution (Jammu and Kashmir) Scheduled Castes Order, 1956. The Order lists  the castes deemed to be Scheduled Castes in the Union Territories of Jammu and  Kashmir and Ladakh. The Constitution (Jammu and Kashmir) Scheduled Tribes  Order (Amendment) Bill, 2023 amends the Constitution (Jammu and Kashmir)  Scheduled Tribes Order, 1989 to create a separate list for Scheduled Tribes for  Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.  The two Bills are clubbed  together.After abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A, the people of Ladakh thought  that they would get justice. Today the people of Ladakh are demanding statehood  and inclusion in the Sixth Schedule. In 2003, our Union Ministry constituted a  High Power Committee with the objective of ensuring the protection of land and  employment for the people of Ladakh. But the people of Ladakh are still deprived  of this. I would request that the Government should also think about Ladakh and  the Gorkha people living in Darjeeling, West Bengal should also be brought under  the purview of the Sixth Schedule.    THE MINISTER OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT The Public Examinations (Prevention of  Unfair Means) Bill, 2024, has brought different stages and \\u2018unfair means\\u2019 has been  categorised under clause 3 of the Bill. All these categories are already covered by  the Indian Penal Code and Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 also which has been  passed but has not yet been implemented. There is no deficiency of laws to cover  these criminal activities, but the problem is the implementation. That is the greatest  failure in our country today. I am not objecting to anything, but still, I am saying  that all the activities are already covered. Existing laws are there. You are further  categorising it, making a sub-category, but in a broader sense, it all exists. Our  young generation is honest.  Our young generation will develop our country.  We  believe and we have trust.  But if there is one or there are two persons, segregate it,  please.   For the commitment of a criminal activity by one or two persons, the rest  should not suffer.  The Central Government must look into that. Please do not go  on the basis of the media trial.  Of course, the provisions are good.  I would seek  one clarification from the hon. Minister. If impositions of penalty are different,  which law would be followed? This Government is finally giving  respect to the Valmiki Community through the Scheduled Caste Order and the Koli  Community and the Pahari Ethnic Group through the Schedule Tribe order. What  is this Government doing with the SCs, STs and OBCs across the Country? Has it  been fulfilling the reservation facilities already in vogue in other parts of the  country? Has there been any specific object to uplift the people of Jammu and  Kashmir by the Government of India? That needs to be clarified. No specific  projects or ideas have been tabled in the House to improve the lives of the people  of Jammu and Kashmir. Only the implementation of the reservation policy will not  serve the purpose. The provision of punishment for atrocities on backward people  has not been highlighted. In 2022 alone, there were nearly 60,000 atrocities against  the Schedule Castes and 10,064 atrocities against the Schedule Tribes. As per the  NCRB data, the crime against tribals has been increasing year after year. Just in 2  years, from 2020 to 2022, there has been nearly 22 per cent increase in crimes  against tribals. Madam, the gross enrolment ratio of SC and ST students at the  undergraduate level is at 23 per cent and 17.2 per cent respectively whereas the  national average is 26.3 per cent. The Eklavya Schools are meant for SC and ST  students. But, still, 38,000 vacancies across the country have not been filled up.  You are setting up schools, Colleges and Universities if the vacancies have not  been filled. Students will come and there will be no teachers to teach me, how will   their education takes place. We have witnessed that the amount allotted for the  Union Government\\u2019s Umbrella Scheme for Development of Scheduled Castes and  the Umbrella Programme for Development of Scheduled Tribes has been  underspent. Sir, these schemes underspent nearly 28 per cent and 24 per cent of the  amount respectively. Please restore the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir to these  people. In the name of demonetization, the people of the country were made to  stand in queues, many lost their lives. Terrorism has not stopped to date. Our  soldiers are sacrificing their lives every day. You are hurting the federal structure.  Ministry spent only 20 per cent less than what they were allotted. We need more  schemes for the welfare of students and also for the welfare of SCs, STs, OBCs  and minorities. We have started the Kanyashree scheme which is benefitting 78  lakh women in West Bengal and which has been recognised by the United Nations.  Mamta Didi's Government has set up a Scheduled Caste Advisory Council which  does not exist in any state. If we truly want to move forward with those thoughts,  then we should take everyone along.  I support these two Amendment Bills  i.e. Constitution (Jammu and Kashmir) Scheduled Castes Order (Amendment) Bill,  2023 and the Constitution (Jammu and Kashmir) Scheduled Tribes Order  (Amendment) Bill, 2023 which are related to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.   The living conditions of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in this country are  very poor. The Government is also not taking care of the welfare of Scheduled  Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the country. The budget allocation under SEP and   TSP for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes has decreased.  In many of the  areas, SC/ST fund allocation has also got lapsed. SC/ST funds in different  Ministries are also not being spent timely.  Atrocities among the Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled Tribes are increasing day by day throughout the country, especially  in the northern part of India. We have the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled  Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act to deal with it, but it is not being  implemented properly. Another important issue is unemployment.  There is a long- pending demand from the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities to  have special recruitment in the Government sector as well as the private sector. I  would appeal to the Ministers to take the necessary steps to conduct a special drive  to fill up the backlog vacancies of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in  their sectors.  The Post-Matric Scholarships are not given timely.  Our SC and ST  students are facing serious problems.  They are solely dependent on scholarships  for their studies but the Government is not taking any serious steps to release the  money for the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe students.  Another long- pending demand is related to the Dalit Christians. They should be included in the  Scheduled Castes List.  I would like to appeal to the Hon. Social Justice and  Empowerment Minister to consider this also. Our country is the biggest democratic and  secular country in the world. However today, our Constitutional rights and freedom  are being denied. If you undertake a critical analysis of the achievements of the  past ten years as stated by the hon. President of India, you will notice that all of  these are a result of the work of previous Governments but the current Union  Government takes credit for everything. The widely publicised Pradhan Mantri  Awas Yojana\\u2013Urban and the AMRUT Scheme was basically a reframing of the  Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission launched much before in 2005.  India is a Socialist Republic, one that should be dedicated to the welfare of the  marginalised without only serving the interests of the one per cent. The Union  Government is also proposing disinvestment in the steel sector PSUs which have  existed almost since the Independence of the country. Starting from 2022 to 2023,  for three consecutive years, the Budget allocated for the agricultural sector has  been decreasing. The word \\u2018Secular\\u2019 also seems to be unfamiliar to the Ruling  Party. While India\\u2019s greatest strength lies in the absence of a singular ethnic or  social identity defining the nation, it appears that the current Government is  leaning towards portraying the country, as a \\u2018Hindu Rashtra\\u2019. This is in stark  contrast to the glorious values of secularism enshrined in our Constitution.  Important issues like economic turmoil, the Manipur Conflict, poor infrastructure  and unemployment are being put on the back burner, rarely featuring in the  discussions of this House. This is the first time in Indian history  that 146 Opposition Members were suspended and the present Government has  passed several important Bills without any discussion. This is a huge threat to our  democracy. The situation in Manipur is still unstable even after eight months of the  incidents. It is astonishing that there is no mention of the Manipur issue in the  President's Address. Madam President did not say anything when women wrestlers  were being manhandled and inhumanly dragged by cops during their peaceful  protest.The country witnessed the rapists and murderers of the Bilkis Bano case  being garlanded after their unjustified release much before the completion of their  imprisonment term. And on other critical issues of national importance, like rising  unemployment and inflation, Madam President continues to remain silent. The  report of the Global Hunger Index of 2023 gives India a rank of 111 out of 125  countries. This indicates an alarming level of hunger severity in the country. The  NCRB report of 2023 shows crimes against Scheduled Castes went up by 13 per  cent and against Scheduled Tribes by 14.3 per cent. Reserved seats meant for  Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are lying vacant in different Government  institutions and departments. Appropriate action is not being taken to fill up these  vacant posts. Child rape cases also witnessed a staggering 90 per cent increase  from 2016 to 2022 as per analysis of NCRB data. It is clear that in reality when it  comes to the actual well-being, socio-economic development and empowerment of  India\\u2019s people, there is really not much that has progressed. In the last decade 16 AIIMS  have been established but none of them is fully functional as per the Press release  of 19th December, 2023 of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. What  remains absent in Madam President\\u2019s Address are issues like unemployment,  which is a burning issue, high inflation, the average commoner compromising with  many essential needs, safety and security of girl child, and MSP for farmers. The  reality of the suffering of ordinary and poor people while travelling by trains across  India has been hidden under the hype of Vande Bharat. As far as the Ujjwala  Yojana is concerned, out of 95.9 million PMUY beneficiaries, 11.8 million did not  get even a single LPG cylinder during the last financial year. The CAG Audit  Report in 2019 revealed the cylinder scam in PMUY.  Thereafter, there were no  reports of CAG on PMUY. I would like to say that the Government is  not  providing a 100 days' fund in West Bengal according to the CAG report. We have  the right to know the name of the States of the country to which you are providing  funds as per the CAG report and also those States to whom you are not providing  it. You talk about enabling the poor to board the aeroplanes, but in economy class,  the minimum domestic flight ticket is available for Rs 30 thousand, Rs 29  thousand. The Government is silent about this also. Women's power is being  discussed everywhere. However, as per the NCRB, in 2013 there were 3,09,546  cases of crimes registered against women. In 2022, it reached to 4,45,256 cases  which shows an increase of 30.48 percent in such crimes. The Government must admit the gross lapse  on its part in extending this legislation to Nagaland for nearly one and a half  decades and also to Himachal Pradesh. This incident came to light only when a  petition was filed in the High Court of Himachal Pradesh, challenging the  validity of Family Courts. So, this kind of lapse is not acceptable. The first point  I wish to make is that the Government should constitute a Committee, the way  we had done to repeal redundant and obsolete laws; and let this Committee  scrutinise all the existing laws and recommend corrective measures to the  administrative Ministries, wherever required. The Family Courts system in the  country is not quite in the pink of health. One of the reasons behind this is the  lack of infrastructure and shortage of judges and judicial officers at the lower  level. I have a few very quick suggestions which I would like to make for better  management, functioning, and delivery of justice in Family Courts. Family  Courts can take the help of NGOs in settlement of disputes. Counsellors should  be appointed on a permanent basis and they should be given proper training.  Judges in Family Courts need to be gender sensitized. Procedure in Family  Courts should be simplified to pave speedy and hassle\\u00adfree justice. The  Government may give a thought of appointing qualified social workers and  activists as judges of Family Courts. Every district irrespective of size of  population should have a Family Court. This Act was enacted in the year 1984.  Today, after almost 40 years I would like to ask the Government whether we  have been able to deliver justice, perhaps not.  There are only 715 Family  Courts in a country having  a population of 130 crores. We live in a society  where a new culture is flourishing.  The son is looking upon his parents as a  burden. We are coercing them to land in  old age homes. I had visited  to an old  age home in my constituency Aurangabad. I was surprised to  witness  that a  retired judge was living in that old age home. I was amazed to see which  direction  this society is heading towards.. The dispute between husband and  wife will go on for life, they should get justice, but where will those old parents  go? Hon. Minister, you should bring such a law for these elderly parents also so  that the children do not send  their parents to  the old age home. When judges of  the High Court are appointed, it is decided by the collegium of the Supreme  Court. The full  collegium of the Supreme Court has given its recommendation,  but why is it  that the government has kept it in abeyance for so many years?  If  the Supreme Court Collegium has recommended the judges of Maharashtra,  why has the Government  not implemented it? This Government  brought in a  law to repeal the provisions of  Triple Talaq. This is also a matter of the Family  Court. I would like to bring to  your notice that the State and Central Governments are inviting tenders and  following other processes for the selection of Mine Developer and Operator  (MDO) for the allotment of coal blocks. In this regard, I am sorry to say that  the Government including the Singareni Collieries Company Ltd., in  Telangana are allegedly offering various MDOs without considering JVs as  per Coal India norms and thereby allotting at high rates causing huge loss to  Government/PSUs. So, I would request the hon. Minister of coal to kindly  intervene in the matter and give necessary instructions to the concerned  officials to follow due procedure in allotment of coal blocks in the interest of  the nation. There are severe electricity related problems in  Delhi. Many irregularities are prevalent in the BSES Yamuna Power Ltd. New  connections are not being provided in the colonies located in Mehrauli Legislative  constituency of my Lok Sabha constituency by citing the reason of higher load on  transformers. Power theft in areas like Okhla, Seelampur, Matiamahal, Balli Maran  and Mustafabad is as high as 80% while 70% to 90% rebate is given on penalties  in the bills. Whereas, only 30% to 50% rebate is given in case of theft or misuse  reported in the other areas of Delhi. Why is there such discrimination? Old  transformers are not being replaced. The Government of Delhi has reduced the  plan expenditure in energy sector from 13.44% in 2011 to meager 0.31% in 2020- 21. The rates of electricity have been increased by 6 to 8 percent citing PPAC. The  consumers are paying 12% more for electricity. I therefore, request the Minister of  Power to find a solution to these problems. The recorded number of children studying in  primary and secondary schools in the development blocks of each district of  Chhattisgarh state is about 65,000. But for these English medium schools,  which were opened four years ago, there are no school building, no teachers,  nor any initiative is being taken by the Government of Chhattisgarh for  infrastructure development. I, therefore, request to develop necessary  infrastructure in Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Ignite English medium schools in  development blocks of the entire State. The jute industry in West Bengal is going down and the  employees of this industry have lost their jobs in large numbers.  The bureaucracy is fully  responsible for the plight of jute farmers and jute mills.  I request the hon. Textile  Minister to look into the matter and save jute mills and their workers.  In the year 2016, 10388 Poshan Sakhi were  appointed in the six districts of Dhanbad, Giridih, Dumka, Godda, Koderma and Chatra  in the state of Jharkhand under the ICDS sponsored by the Union Government.  Poshan  Sakhis were made unemployed by the Jharkhand government.  I would like to demand  from the Union Government and the State Government that instructions should be given  to continue the services of these 10388 Poshan Sakhis. Almost, all the Central schemes are  being renamed on the personal name of the Chief Minister and his family names in  Andhra Pradesh.  I request the Government to take swift corrective action in the matter  before it goes out of control.  It is not permissible to invade a country due to  concern for its security. Even though we have had a policy, we have been non-aligned,  but if Russia invaded Ukraine, India should have at least condemned. Secondly, there  were Indian students there.  It was very important to realize that there would be a war.  Before the war started, we should have taken out our children who were studying there.  Thousands of people are being killed in Ukraine. Large buildings, hospitals, military  bases, goods and roads were destroyed. Ukraine's leadership should have compromised in  this case and found its way out. War anywhere is a tragedy.  The war in  Ukraine has put the people of our country to great hardships especially the Indian  students and their families.  I appreciate the efforts taken by the Government to bring  back Indian students through Operation Ganga Mission.  But in the initial stage, the  response from the Government was not so appreciable because the advisory given by the  Government was that whoever wants to come back may come.  So, there was a belief  among the students that they can remain there.  This should not have happened.  I would  like to bring to the notice of the Government to the future of these students.  The  Government should take steps to ensure about their future studies.  The crisis of Ukraine  should open our eyes, and the Indian medical education system should rise up to the  mark. I would like to appeal to the Hon. Minister  that he must understand the real problems being faced by the people belonging to  Scheduled Caste and the Scheduled Tribe communities. The performance of states in granting rights to tribals under Forest Rights Act  since its promulgation should be examined. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs should ensure  that the FRA is being implemented for the benefit of tribals by all the State Governments  but there is no progress is in implementing FRA. Many of the State Governments are not  ready to implement FRA. The Government of India is not taking any initiative to  implement FRA.The Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act for protection of  Scheduled Tribes has not been implemented properly. The tribals are still victims of the  upper caste people. The backlog in vacancies for appointment of Scheduled Tribes is not  being filled up regularly.There is no proper recruitment. The PoA Act is not being  properly implemented for the protection of Scheduled Tribes.I would request the Hon.  Minister to protect the interests of the Scheduled Tribes in the country. I feel that this Bill is anti-people and anti-federal.  The total capacity of our prisons is 4,14,033. The present occupancy is 4,88,511. So,  there is 20 per cent over-capacity as far as occupancy is concerned. 70 per cent of the  people, who are in the prisons are under-trials. They have not got an opportunity to go  and argue for themselves. Our Home Minister is not worried about them. This Bill is  against the Fundamental Right to Privacy of a citizen which has been guaranteed by the  hon. Supreme Court.  As an ordinary citizen, let me break down my concerns into three  parts-what is the data collected, whose data is being collected and who is collecting the  data.  The Bill causes great fear because it is the first step towards establishing the  infrastructure needed to create a police state.  The Bill also seeks to hold this data for 75  years.  Again, the Bill expands the ambit of persons whose measurements can be taken to  include the persons directed by the Magistrate to give their measurements and allows  police and prison officers to take measurements of any person.  Under the provisions of  this Bill, any ordinary citizen who is accused or a person suspected of anything can be  profiled to this extent. Thus, we are giving the Union Government sweeping powers.   Apart from this, this present Bill confers unbridled power on the police officials and  prison officials.   I would like to say that this Bill should  be referred to the Standing Committee. This Bill will not be helpful in the process of  conviction, rather it will prove to be a Bill detrimental to humanity. This Bill is likely to  violate the Right to Privacy. Through this Bill, the police authority or prison authority has  been empowered to take retinal and iris scans including physical and biological samples.  Also, the police constable has been given the power to take these samples. Apart from  this, clear provisions have not been made in this Bill regarding the methods of tests as  well as the quantity of samples. The biggest impact of this Bill will be on the accused to  be detained under sections 107, 108, 109 and 110. I would also like to say that all of our  countrymen have been provided fundamental rights under the provisions of the  Constitution. So, I would like to ask whether the Government is considering to  manipulate the basic spirit of the Constitution through this Bill? This is an important Bill,  which is going to have a direct impact on all 130 crore citizens of India. So, I would  request that the Government should not bring this Bill forcefully. This Bill is a classic case where the Executive is  giving itself more powers.  When checks and balances are not there, that is when a  democratic State can be an autocratic State.  So, this Bill should be reformed to the  Standing Committee.  Both at the central level and at the state level there is no Data  Protection Law, data management and the DNA law and hence there is no eco-system in  the country because of these shortcomings. In such a situation a number of questions can  arise. That\\u201fs why we want that the government should not make haste in regard to this  Bill. Today, there are a lot of problems in the judicial system but you have not brought in  the Bill to sort out those problems. There is so much that you can bring in order to  strengthen the arms of law enforcement agencies, but it is unfortunate that this  Government always brings Bills that can only be politicized and be used to harass its  political opponents. We have talked about the UAPA. Let me know how many hardcore  terrorists have been caught under UAPA and how many students and petty activists have  been caught. We are expressing our concerns over this Bill as this law has scope for  being misused. Therefore, on the basis of the Constitutional propriety, propriety of Indian  principles and the propriety of governance, I demand that this Bill should be sent to the  Standing Committee. My objection to this Bill is that the  Government is bringing in this law without respecting constitutional right to privacy or  the right against self-incrimination under Article 20. It wants to create databases of  citizens but does not want to provide any safeguards. NCRB is being empowered to  maintain a database of measurements collected under this Bill. NCRB is not a statutory  body. How can legislation empower a Board that has no statutory existence itself?  Secondly, under section 4, no parameters have been provided on who has the power to  access this data, what police officer of what rank? Improper recording or handling of the  data in database is a serious concern. What are the safeguards against malicious misuse or  distortion of data? Interlinking databases is a huge violation of citizens' Right to Privacy  as it allows the Government to identify citizens even for purposes other than crime  detection. This Bill is unbridled power in the hands of Government and police.  Preventive detention suspects and arrestees are not criminals. There is a presumption of  innocence. On what grounds the government is collecting their information?  Muslims,  Adivasis and the Dalits are predominantly detained and arrested and hardly convicted.  This means that your database will have a significantly large number of such people. I vehemently oppose the Bill.  It  offers a carte blanche to the police officials to collect samples according to their whims  and fancies.  This Bill does provide for the access to storage for DNA indexing.  In the  absence of any restriction on the scope of the notification under Clause 4, Sub-Clause 3,  it cannot be ruled out that the task of collecting, preserving and sharing in measurement  may be assigned to some private agency.  It will be impingement on the sovereign  function of the state.  Our Police Forces are neither skilled in sample collection nor is  there any provision for their proper training to this end.   It was aimed to uplift the people of  Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes by providing them reservation and certain other  facilities.  However, unfortunately this could not happen in the last 75 years.  Even a  single caste has not come out of this list in all these years.  Higher castes always try to get  themselves into the list of SC/ST either due to printing mistake or due to phonetic  variations.  I mean to say that if we do not exclude the community which has progressed,  how will the downtrodden ones will see upliftment?  The real tribals and poor people  should get facilities.  Rights of thousands of tribals have been usurped by others by taking  government jobs on the basis of bogus caste certificates.  So, FIRs should be filed against  such people. Gonds are tribals everywhere, but they  are left out in some districts.  This is a problem which can be seen in many parts of the  country.  Jhodia caste is not tribal in Kashipur, but in Kalahandi Jhodia is in tribal  list.  Dora is tribal in Andhra Pradesh, but not in Odisha.  The Government is not ready to  continue the reservation system in Government offices and is talking about  conversion.  The Hindu Marriage Act is not applicable to the tribals, but when a tribal  convert into a Christian, then miscreants attacked them.  This is how they are going to  abolish the reservations.  Whatever land is there, they are giving it to the  industrialists.  Government should bring such a Bill which make us progress.  Only  reservation is not enough.  The forest, land, water, all belongs to us but gradually  everything is going out of our hands.  You will privatize.  When there is no job, what will  we do by having reservation?  You are disposing every PSUs.  Bank is not ready to give  us a loan.  How will we progress?  This is the major problem. Sports code was formulated for selection of  sportspersons, conducting elections, carrying out everything in transparent and free and  fair manner but neither the Ministry nor the Sports Minister is there to look after it.  Sports are a clean thing but it becomes dirty after resorting to politics. The number of  medals which used to be won by merely shooters of our country in international  competitions and olympics were not won even by the sportspersons of other games  together. The tally is zero now. Sports are not being promoted in that proportion.  Arbitrariness is prevailing. Everything is being neglected now. Provision of Municipal bodies was made in the  Constitution through the 74th amendment in 1992 with a view to strengthening the  democracy at the grassroot level.  In 2011-12, MCD was trifurcated without thinking of  the resources of revenue for the North MCD and the East MCD.  The Delhi finance  commission had recommended that approximately Rs. 40,500 crore should be provided  for running the corporations.  However, the Government of Delhi got only Rs. 17,000  crore approved from Delhi Assembly for running the MCD.  However, they released only  Rs. 6,129 crore.  All the three corporations gave three proposals to the Delhi Government  to increase their revenue.  The first was to increase the commercial tax but the Delhi  Government did not grant its permission.  Then, the three corporations sought permission  from the Government to issue Bonds but that has also been kept pending.  All the three  corporations have undertaken numerous development works.   They have established 95  new schools whereas the Delhi Government has not established even a single new school  during the last seven years. What is the urgency to bring in a Bill in  this form?  What is the justification for reducing the number of Councilors from 272 to  250 when the population of the country is increasing and we probably need more  representatives for the given set of population?  There is absolutely no logic in doing this.   The Supreme Court had already made an observation saying that this Government is  bringing in Bills without putting in much thought into it.  Even they were forced to repeal  the Farm Bills because of the huge protest by the farmers.  Similarly, when the Delhi  Government had trifurcated it, I feel, probably there must have been a reason behind that.   Has anybody looked into that?  The biggest problems which these municipal corporations  face is with regard to the garbage dump yard.  The Government of India should create a  separate fund for modernization of the garbage disposal mechanism.  I suggest adoption  of a process called bio-mining for disposal of the garbage.  I totally oppose this Bill, and  hope that the Government would withdraw this Bill. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (Amendment)  Bill, 2022 is an important Bill.  This Bill is indicative of the policy of the country as well  as the direction of politics.  You are damaging the federal structure that we have.  It is  unfortunate that there was a proposal in Mumbai to form three corporations of the  Municipal Corporation.  After the election, you will appoint an administrator.  He will  administer the functioning of the corporation.  If you want to bring it, then appoint a  committee.  Let the opposition and the government work together.  There will be a  federal structure.  These are the rights of the assembly, so why are you doing this?  You  should make such a policy so that the people feel that not only political decisions but  social decisions have been taken democratically. My objection is that the decision  on unification was taken on the day the Delhi Municipal Corporation\\u2019s election was  going to be announced.  Similarly, I would also like to ask the Government that when you  do delimitation, is it, not increasing the number rather.  So, what is the logic of reducing  the corporators?  Again, I would urge that this is India\\u2019s Parliament.  We are here to  discuss the issues of the country and not to discuss the corporations.  I think that the  Government is actually taking autonomy away from the States and also the cooperative  federalism.  So, I just want to know the mechanism we will have by merging all these  three corporations.  To me, it does not matter whether there are three corporations or one  corporation as long as people get better services.  My only request to this Government is  not to bring Assembly issues to Parliament.  Parliament has a larger role in policy- making for Government of India.  So, I urge the Government to send this Bill to the  Assembly. The Institute of Chartered Accounts of  India is in place since 1949.  It is being managed by a Council which has got 40 Members  out of which eight are nominated by the Government of India.  The Chartered  Accountants are the partners in nation-building.  I request that the Government should  withdraw those provisions which will destroy this profession.  The Disciplinary  Committee is proposed to be headed by a bureaucrat.  The disciplinary mechanism is a  quasi-judicial function, and the members should have adequate knowledge and functional  experience in the field of accounting standards etc.  In other professions, all regulatory  bodies have the members from the respective fields only.  So, it is unfair to appoint Non- Chartered Accountants as the members of the Disciplinary Committee.  The existing  position regarding the composition of the Disciplinary Committee should be retained.   I appreciate the effort of the  Government to bring in transparency. One hon. Member said that this will help simplify,  reduce Government\\u2019s interference and bring in more autonomy. It is actually the other  way round. There is a hidden agenda. There are multiple bodies and regulators. Do we  really need another regulator, are these not strong enough? There is still a grey area in it.  Will whistle blowers be protected?  This Government has lost crores of rupees due to  inappropriate NCLT provisions. What they are doing now is just a legislative mockery.  The World Bank has said that ease of doing business is something that they have stopped  looking at. The Government is saying that it wants investors\\u2019 protection, but how it is  protecting the investors? It is doing nothing. This Bill should be sent to a Select  Committee. It can be discussed there. Let the professionals do their job, and let the  Government do its job. This Bill is brought to strengthen the  disciplinary mechanism of these institutes.  Numerous scams have taken place in the  country and these scams have put a question mark on the role and effectiveness of the  independent auditors.  The provision of punishment made in this Bill is inadequate. I  would demand to incorporate criminal liability also so that these uncontrolled auditors  face jail term as a deterrent. People\\u2019s representatives should also be had on the  Disciplinary Board.  After the new provision relating to Bank audit, approximately 50 per  cent branches have remained unaudited.   This is the main reason for scams.   The  Government should also address the problems faced by the profession of Chartered  Accountants. I oppose this Bill. There are no concrete plans in the Address  to correct the administrative failures of the Government. COVID-19 pandemic has  rendered millions of people jobless. More than five lakh people have died because of this  pandemic. This Address does not find any mention about that. It has been mentioned in  the Address  that the Government is upholding the ideals of Dr. Ambedkar like liberty,  equality and fraternity but in practice, the Government has failed in upholding those  ideals. The demand of the farmers to implement MSP through legislation is still pending.  The rubber growers are not happy with the Government\\u201fs policy. The Government is not  taking care of the bee-keepers in Kerala. Under the PM-KISAN Scheme, the farmers in  India are being provided Rs. 6,000 per year. It is not sufficient. Every marginal and small  farmers should be paid at least Rs. 10,000 per month so that they can survive under the  difficult circumstances. The President\\u201fs Address mentions that the collection of GST is  very high and more than Rs. 1,46,000 crore has been collected but the demand of the  States to pay compensation is not being heard by the Centre. I would demand that the  Centre should take steps to pay GST compensation to the States and also the  compensation period should be extended to a further period of five years. There is a mention  in the  President\\u201fs Address about doctors and others who fought against the Covid. We support  the Government on these programmes. Government has extended help to Maharashtra  through PDS. The biggest problem facing the country is that of unemployment.  Maharashtra has done the best under start-up India. Atmosphere in the country is not  good at present. The Government is quoting Baba Saheb Ambedkar but  their deeds do  not conform to his ideals. Nothing is mentioned in this address  regarding fulfillment of the promises made by the government with the people of the  country to come to power.  Apart from this, inflation is increasing very much in the  country, it has become difficult for the general public to buy daily use items.   The  government is not doing anything for the middle class of the country, the government is  not making any strategy to control inflation.  The government has completely failed even  on the promise of doubling the income of the farmers of the country by the year 2022, the  problem of unemployment in the country is increasing day by day.  This government  came to power with the promise of two crore jobs annually.  But ever since this  government was formed, the unemployment rate in the country has been increasing  continuously.  Due to the corona virus epidemic, more than 5.2 crore people became  unemployed in the country.  Youth unemployment is at a record level due to the  irregularities in the Railway Recruitment Examination.  The government has not talked  about that.  It has been said in the address that for the last several months, the GST  collection in the country is above Rs 1 lakh crore, but the government is not giving the  full share of the GST of the states for the last two years. It should be given soon.  There  are many vacant posts in the Union Government, that subject was not taken  up.  Agriculture sector plays an important role in our economy.  In the speech, it has been  said to be given compensation of more than 1 lakh crore under the crop insurance  scheme, whereas whenever any natural calamity comes, the crops of the farmers are  destroyed, and when the farmer applies for its compensation, the insured  They do not get  insurance compensation on time by the companies, the government had promised to build  four crore houses by 2022, it is not mentioned in this addressThe promise was made to  increase the scholarship for the children of  scheduled  caste and scheduled tribe, that too  is not included in it.  The government did not say anything on China-Pakistan relations,  civilians were killed in Nagaland.  No announcement was made to give full statehood to  Jammu and Kashmir again. Every wing of governance-Parliament,  Executive and Judiciary are thoroughly demoralized and insulted at every opportune  moment. This Government is anxious to subvert the basic structure of this country of 140  crore citizens comprising several social, cultural, religious and linguistic identities into a  singular identity. All efforts are in full swing to make Savarkar as the Father of the  Nation.  This is not just a replacement of personality but a big shift away from the secular  basics.  The worst part is the rejection of Veera Velu Natchiar who was the first  Queen/woman warrior and who physically led the army and fought the battle and laid her  life in the battle field.   This was full hundred years before the much-celebrated Queen of  Jhansi was born.  This country is a Union of States.  The union is a bond that brings  together this multi ethnic, multicultural diversified land space into a nation, but still the  State remains the soul and the domain of sovereignty. The Citizenship Act may be  handled by the Union but the citizens are with the State.  The pandemic situation exposed  the inability of this Government in many a ways.  The worst affected were migrant  labourers and were seen walking several thousand miles to home and many died enroute.  The highest point of strangeness is the declaration of year 2023 as Millet year.  National  Education Policy and entrance examinations proposed are in favour of rich and upper  castes.  It disadvantages the already under-privileged and again operates to perpetuate the  sanatanic caste inequality. Overcoming the discriminations is the essence of service to the  humanity. Abolishing all forms of entrance examinations in the education sector is a  must. The  Presidential Address has nothing new in itself.  During Covid-19 pandemic, about 50  lakhs of people died.  The farmers\\u201f movement resulted in the death of more than 750  persons.  Due to the new Farm Laws the farmers had to sit on dharnas for one year.  The  Government failed to achieve the target of doubling the income of farmers by the year  2022.  The targets set under PM Awas Yojana were not achieved.  The number of attacks  on the persons belonging to SC/ST/OBC, women and the minority people is rising.   Nothing has been mentioned about all these things in the Address. I feel that Presidential Address should have been a  strategic address.  Unfortunately, the Presidential Address was a long list of things that  the Government claims to have done but did not really contain the deeper strategic issues.   Also, the Presidential Address did not touch a couple of central challenges facing our  country.  Your government continuously attacked the unorganized sector and small and  medium enterprises during the last seven years. The support required during the Corona  crisis was not given. As a result 84 per cent people of India saw their income declined.  UPA government had alleviated poverty of 23 crore people in 10 years. It is a fact. Look  at any sector, we see two monopolists. This government has destroyed the whole small  and medium industry. There is 46 per cent drop in manufacturing jobs in India. It is  because that the government has destroyed unorganized sector. Today, top hundred  richest persons of India have more assets than that possessed by 55 crore Indians. It is  because of this government. Their leadership have no idea of history. Our country is like  a bouquet of flowers. This is our strength. What is happening as a result of their flawed  vision of the country? Two Indias are being created. No power in the world has ever been  able to challenge this bouquet of flowers. There is another vision- a centralising vision,  the vision of a king. That idea of a king has come back. The farmers of Punjab do not  have a voice in their framework. Only the king has the voice.  I would like to strongly oppose the Motion of Thanks on the  President's Address.  I am opposing this Motion because there was no concrete plan to  either strengthen the economy of this country or to address the issues faced by the  common man during the last two years of COVID.  This Government has not supported  the farmers of this country.  This government has not supported the Covid-19 patients of  this country.  This Government has not even given employment to lakhs and crores of  youth and has not supported them. This government has supported neither backward  classes nor youth, fishermen, dalits, tribals, who are sufferers, so, 'Sabka Sath, Sabka  Vikas, Sabka Vishwas' is an empty slogan.  We have a global pandemic in place but there  are no concrete methods to fight against this pandemic and also, no COVID relief  packages are announced in this country by this Government.  There are lakhs and lakhs of  people who were bread winners of their families and who lost their lives due to COVID.   But the Central Government has declared neither any package nor declared anything for  the families of the COVID victims.  The Government has cut down Rs. 25,000 crore of  MGNREGA, which was very vital in providing jobs to many urban and rural population.   After 2015, no fund was received by the State of Kerala from the Centre Government for  building seawalls for the fishermen community.  Their lives and livelihoods are at stake.   South India has been ignored as far as Gati Shakti project is concerned.  Kochi Metro  Rail is one of the finest metro rails in the country.  Unfortunately, there is no mention in  the Budget and there is no mention in any of the Speeches about the Kochi Metro Rail  second phase expansion which is supposed to be from Jawahar Lal Nehru Stadium to the  Info Park Kakkanad and it is most economically feasible. This is a retrogressive amendment. This is  against the right to freedom under Article 19. What have you done for the 18 years old?  The women\\u2019s labour force participation in India is lower than Somalia. It is not good for the Government to introduce  the Bill all of a sudden and get it passed without discussion or debate. It is undemocratic.  THE MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT This is the Bill whereby the entire democracy is  being taken away. This Bill needs a discussion. The hon. Minister had committed that it  would be sent to Standing Committee. Now, this is his master plan to kill the entire thing. I definitely want to wake up the government from  daydreaming. While on one hand, the government has devastated the rural economy by  shifting its focus to unicorns, whereas demonetisation and poor implementation of GST  and the COVID pandemic have decimated the country's small and medium scale  industries. Here small and medium industries were the largest employers of our country.  More than 70 percent of the total population of the country lives in rural areas and these  70 percent people contribute 46 percent of the country's income. Today people in rural  areas are plagued by inflation and the entire economy has been destroyed. Even when the  outbreak of the pandemic and recession was widespread in rural areas, this Government  only increased the allocation of MGNREGA by 1.8 per cent. The allocation made for  MGNREGA this year is less than the actual allocation for the year 2015-2016. In the  wake of COVID, the government should bring some policy for the education system  soon, otherwise, students\\u2019 entire one-year education tenure will turn into complete  darkness. There has been no job creation in India in the last seven years. This government  works to make favourable policies for the few capitalist people. I would definitely like to  say that policies are being made only for those sectors, which do not generate  employment. In conclusion, I would just like to say that this government is working to  swindle the Dalits, minorities and the poor by giving priority to divisive and capitalist  politics. This government has not taken any concrete steps. I rise to speak in support of Supplementary  Demands for Grants. Recently, October report of International Monetary Fund has come  out. The entire world is suffering due to Covid and unemployment is at its peak. It is said  that the health system of Europe, UK and the US is very good but whether you agree or  not, we have saved 130 crore people under the leadership of hon. Prime Minister.  Perhaps, no country has been able to create such a health system. In the year 2004, Air  India and Indian Airlines were separate companies and were in profits. CAG report of  2011 said that Air India and Indian Airlines should not be merged. This was a wrong  decision. Even the boards of Air India and Indian Airlines told that this merger should not  take place. But they went ahead with this merger against the opinion of both the boards.  Both the boards were of the opinion that they were not in the position to buy more than  17-18 planes. But what we did? The Indian Government gave sovereign guarantee and  instead of 17 planes it placed order for 117 planes. Who received this commission? What  was the need of buying so many planes when Air India and Indian Airlines did not have  money? When it seemed that the situation will not improve then they again fixed a turn  around plan in 2010-11. I am only saying how the UPA Government played havoc with  this country and its taxpayers.  This Bill represents a pure question of law. The  question is, can a substantive sentencing provision in criminal law be given retrospective  effect by a legislative declaration.  Unfortunately this Bill does not address this question.  If this Bill is accepted in the form in which the Government has proposed it, this would  mean that Article 20 of the Constitution of India will become redundant and we are going  to open the floodgates of misuse. If at any point of time in the future, any law can be  brought and can be given effect retrospectively, then no person in this country can ever  be safe. It has implications on the confidence which people have in our supreme  legislative institutions. This Amendment Act talks about imprisonment from ten years to  life and it is a substantive sentencing provision. How will any court allow it to have  retrospective effect? Even in case of tax and tax legislations taxes can be collected with  retrospective effect but penal provisions cannot be applied retrospectively. I think that  this amendment is not likely to pass judicial scrutiny. It will be better if it comes into  force from the date on which this law gets notified.  Synthetic drugs are being  manufactured in legitimate pharmaceutical factories.  That is something which the  Government has been completely unable to come to grips with. I would like to request  the government to tighten its enforcement agency instead of amending the Act so that the  narcotic substances coming to India from Afghanistan and Pakistan are checked. The issues related to drug are not  just in India but they are also all over the world. It is one of the biggest challenges the  youth in India and the world faces. It is a burning issue amongst the youth, it would have  been nicer if the Government had come up with a broader Bill rather than acting upon the  direction of the court. It is not fair to put the entire Bollywood fraternity in corner if some  evil people consume drugs in Bollywood. It is very unfortunate that the Government does  media trial to anybody in a particular fraternity especially when the contribution of that  unit has to be registered. Bollywood stars give an identity to Indians all over the world. It  is not just glamour. There is a lot of hard work, dedication and commitment. If war is to  be waged against drug we will have to crack down on the big fish involved in the  industry. The most important question concerning this  Bill is that how can a criminal law be amended with retrospective effect. So, the  Government is committing an error in moving this Bill and the Government must redraft  the Bill. I would also quote the Chief Justice of India who stated that the legislature has  passed laws without conducting studies or assessing their impacts, and this half-baked  legislation is a perfect example of the sentiment expressed by the Chief Justice of India.  So, with regard to section 27A of NDPS Act, I would like to ask when the catalogue or  description of offence itself a absent, how could the main provision operate with  efficiency and how it will dispense fullest justice? The High Court ruling further ordered  that both the Central Government and the the State Government shall publish a  notification bringing about the content of this order, in short, for the public notice so that  the requirement of Article 20 of the Constitution of India is not diminished. So the  Government failure and wilful dithering on an important legislation in a subject related to  narcotics Act is a serious lapse. The Budget is anti people and   corporate friendly.  To manage the Budget deficit 9.5 percent, the  Government announces not only to privatise the PSUs but it is also trying to  sell their assets and properties including land. Additional cess on cooking oil,  pluses, urea being used by farmers, will have a negative impact affecting the  working class.  I urge upon the Government that the cess should be  withdrawn and efforts to privatise PSUs should also be given up.  Drastic  reduction in the allocation of funds meant for post matric scholarships for  SC/ST students will impact the poor students belonging to Dalit communities  pursing the education.  I urge the Special Component Plan should be restored  and additional funds should be allocated to providing SC/ST Scholarships.  In  Tamil Nadu, 69 per cent reservation is being implemented in letter and spirit.   Implementation of only 50 per cent reservation in the universities, educational  and other institutions being funded by UGC will impact the social justice.  This  Government is against upholding social justice, and the poor and welfare of  the common man and  protecting  the interest of Corporates. I would like to draw the attention of  the Government towards increasing unemployment, rising inflation and  economic recession in the country. Hon. Finance Minister has not made  sufficient budgetary provision for the lower middle class particularly labourers,  women, temporary employees and people belonging to SCs, STs and OBCs  and the students as well. A Sainik Schools should be setup at Shrawasti, in  my Parliamentary Constituency. Two districts come under Shrawasti. Both the  districts are very backward and majority of people living there are illiterate. I,  therefore, request the hon. Finance Minister to make budgetary provision for  open a vocational college there to provide better education. There is a feeling that the allocation of  funds for the vulnerable sections, especially, the Scheduled Castes and  Scheduled Tribes has been neglected. I would like to request the Hon.  Minister to enhance this amount sufficiently. So many demands were  submitted to the Government regarding my state Kerala, but these demands  were not considered. There are so many issues like, the Sabarimala Railway  line, establishment of AIIMS, Railway zone, Kannur-Calicut airport  development and other small and medium projects. These are also not taken  into consideration. I would request the hon. Finance Minister to kindly provide  Rs. 1000 crore as  second package for infrastructure development of my  constituency Kuttanad. India's economy was sick before the  coronavirus crisis. GDP growth has been declining since 2016, and  investment since 2018. GDP grew at 4.2% in the 2019- 20, its slowest pace in  nearly a decade. India's GDP showing alarming downturn of 23.9% which is  all time high in the past 40 years. GDP downfall takes us somewhere back to  45 years which is totally unpalatable when we are trying to take our economy  towards the 5 trillion economy status. The pandemic pushed the economy into  an abyss. Seven years of the Modi Government have wrecked our economy  and the prospects of high growth. The biggest rise in poverty will be in India  and India will overtake Nigeria and become the country with the largest  number of poor people. The Petrol prices are expected to hit a century. It is  because the Central Government has increased the excise duty on diesel by  8 times and on petrol by 2-1/2 times. The Central Government has earned  more than 20 lakh crore rupees from this additional excise. First of all, it  should reduce the increase in excise on petrol and diesel, secondly the  Congress Party wants to know where the 20 lakh crore rupees has gone.  India's crores of farmers are fighting a decisive battle to save their farms and  fields, their lives and livelihood, and their present and their future The  government refuse to feel their agony or listen to their cry for justice. Three  Agrarian Laws did not pass the test of Parliamentary Scrutiny as they were  bulldozed by muzzling the voice of the opposition. These laws, when  implemented, will affect every citizen of the country as pricing of all food  products would be at the mercy of a handful of people. There is only one  demand of India's farmers and farm labourers - repeal the three objectionable  laws. The Government should forthwith repeal the three Anti- Agriculture  Laws.  Joblessness is becoming an epidemic in the  country. Many millions of  employed people have lost their jobs and the biggest losers have been  women. Out of whooping 30,000 new job seekers everyday, only 500 can  realistically expected to get a job. The unfortunate truth of the speech is that  no condolence or importance was given to the poor and marginalized who  constitute the majority of our country. The Government is taxing the poor and  patting the rich. Indian economy saw unprecedented collapse and the nation  witnessed a humanitarian crisis of unforeseen proportions. The shutdown of  the economy sent lakhs of workers on the long walk home and many  perished. The incomes of silent classes saw deep cuts and a lot people lost  their jobs. More than 30 per cent of our MSMEs have reportedly been closed  down permanently. In such grim circumstances, the nation was waiting for a  revival package. It is an unprecedented let-down Budget. The common man is  left with nothing but empty words and unfulfilled promises.  There is no  income tax concession. In this Budget, there is not a single good news to the  middle-class. Construction, aviation, tourism and hospitality industries have  been adversely affected. The Government should reduce the rates of GST.  On the contrary, they hiked the excise duty on petrol. We are worried that in  the wake of tension with China, the figures on defence spending barely show  any change. The Budget allocation for the Department of Agriculture and  Farmer Welfare has been slashed by 8.5 per cent in 2021-22. The farmers  are agitating for about 90 days but the Government has shown no  compassion towards them. The Government has touted the health  expenditure set out in the Budget as the game changer but technically the  funds allocated to the health sector are lesser than what was allocated  previous year. When you are focusing so much on the Corona pandemic  vaccine please ensure that the regular programmes do not get a backseat.  There is a discomfort as people are not truly trusting the vaccine. I am saying  this with no political agenda but I really want the people of our country to be  protected. The PSUs have failed miserably. Now, the Government is in a  spree to sell our PSUs. Why cannot you cut down on your advertisement?  You are spending crores and crores of money to keep the media shut. Why  cannot you put that money into our PSUs? Please look at BSNL. Should the  Prime Minister not take the lead and ensure to be a poster boy for BSNL? LIC  is the only Government-owned life insurance company and you plan to sell it  off and fund the Government. You said that Air India is in very bad shape. No  private airlines came forward to bring Indians from abroad. Our Prime  Minister, last year, said that in a country of 130 crore, only 1.5 crore people  are paying taxes, that is nearly one per cent. Let me tell you that may be one  per cent is paying taxes, but 99 per cent are also paying taxes, indirect taxes.  The banking system is digitalised. The Government has not done anything for  better service for public. This Budget has not addressed the serious question  of job creation. While millions of Indians lost jobs or sunk into poverty, the  fortunes of the country\\u201fs two richest people are increasing day to day. The  Finance Minister has made some announcement for Tamil Nadu after  neglecting Tamil Nadu for nearly eight years. AIIMS was supposed to come in  Madurai. Till now, there is not even a single stone put there. There is a long  pending demand for a train to Jodhpur, Rajasthan, from Central Chennai. I  would request the Railway Minister to look into it and do something about it.   Sir, I stand here to speak  on the Budget. COVID really added to all the bad policies which were taken  by this Government. I would like to just highlight, and just take two minutes  about the U-turns of this Government. GST, Right to Education, NREGA,  Aadhar, were initiated by the previous government. During the COVID time,  everybody who lost their jobs in the city went back to their villages and the  only saviour there was MGNREGA and that is how thousands and thousands  of families have survived. The hon. Prime Minister talked about \\u201eintent versus  content\\u201f. Everybody has a good intent. Why is the Government running away  from Committees? Committees are very good institutions. A good feedback is  taken. The Government should open his arms, call the farmers and resolve  the issue. If the Government really wants to work around the farmers, let us  stop this conflict because any aberration like this is not helping any of us.  There are two points that I need to bring to the notice of this Government. The  Government is talking about the GST compensation. The GST compensation  that the Central Government owes us, is Rs.26,597 crore. If you give us that  money, we will be happy to give free vaccine. The Finance Minister of India  has taken twelve crores from every MP without even asking us. On the other  hand, the Finance Minister of Maharashtra has made sure that every MLA,  from all the four Parties, including from the Opposition, gets Rs. 5 crore every  year without cut. The other thing is with regard to the FRBM Act. Now, the  FRBM Act is something of really a concern for us. You have to very urgently  bring this Act because we cannot borrow. Another u-turn of this Government  is the PMC Bank issue. Now, I come to the non-performing assets and jobs.  Now, I come to MUDRA loans. There is so much of mixed reactions. I really  do not know what truth the Government is saying. Non-utilisation of cess  revenue is another way to ill-treat the States. You collect all the cess. Nothing  comes to us. Now, there is a new agriculture cess. The CAG Report said that  whatever monies have come - have either not fully been transferred to the  dedicated fund or remains unutilized. So, I think you owe it to the States. In  your Government, New Education Policy emphasises on doubling the  Government\\u201fs expenditure for education. You have reduced it. One last point,  I want to bring to the notice of this Government is about the NBFCs. There is  no regulation for this NBFCs. I do understand the Finance Minister has had  her own challenges with COVID. On the ground, it is exceptionally grim \\u2013 be it  the farmers issue or be it the unemployment issue. Farmers are not only the food providers  but protect the nation also. Mostly children of the farmers are deployed at the  borders, whom you have left in bad state in such a shivering cold condition.  There is nothing for farmers, officers and labourers in the budget. You have  given nothing to. You have given nothing to anyone in this budget. In this  tough time you are spending thousand crores on construction of the New  Parliament. You have deducted salaries of officials and those of ours. You  have deducted arrears of officials. Had you given time of a week or ten days  to the labourers trapped  in different parts of the country when trains and  buses were operating, they would have reached home. You have not come up  with the law on minimum support price. You are going to sell BPCL, Shipping  Corporation, Containers Corporation, IDBI Bank, Pawanhans, Neelanchal  Ispaat and BEML. You are also going to sell Air India, though it is a different  thing that there are no buyers for them. Operation of several trains in my area  has been stopped. I would like to request hon'ble Minister of Railways to start  their operation. The work of flyovers and medical College in Jaunpur may be  completed. A Central School and a sugar mill may be established in Jaunpur  district. The number of Yadav and Ahir in the cadre of officers and soldiers in  Force is very high in India. So, the formation of Ahir Regiment is necessary. The issues raised by the President are  of vital importance, but the claims of the Government about able handling of the  above is thoroughly unsustainable. On the economic front, the bungling was  much severe.  The economic growth has fallen to -23.5 per cent and the recovery  needs imaginative and sincere effort on the part of the Government.  But the  Government's attitude is nowhere near such effort.  It is true that India is a global  leader in vaccination manufacture.  Another important aspect of the Presidential  Address is the tall claim about the proposal of open several medical colleges all  over the country.  At most times, these announcements remain on paper alone  and the case of AIIMS Institute in Madurai is a great example.  Madurai has  become a laughing stock now in Tamil Nadu.  The policy of conducting NEET  examination is spoiling the chances of poor and needy backward classes and  Scheduled Cast and Tribe people.  It is known that this Government is against  social justice and wants to erase the reservation/affirmative action program.  Few  million farmers from various States are in peaceful protest for several months  now, which has drawn the attention of the world.  Several rounds of talks have  failed to bring about any resolution.  The farm laws are in no way going to benefit  the farmers.  The haste and impropriety shown by the Government has raised a  genuine doubt in everybody's mind and the best way out is to repeal the  unwarranted farm law. We have been living together harmoniously  for centuries and it has become the identity of our India. If somebody tries to  disturb this harmony, he is certainly doing this for gaining political mileage. So  far as the farming and farmers are concerned, MSP has been confined only to  speeches but has not been implemented at the grass root level. This is not  being given to farmers.  If it had been given to the farmers, they would not  have been here to besiege Delhi. I would like to ask the Government if the  farmers of Uttar Pradesh have been given the MSP? If the laws enacted by  the Government are not acceptable to the farmers, why does the Government  not withdraw these laws? After all, who is preventing the Government from  withdrawing these laws? In view of these situations, it seems that they have  not been chosen as public representatives but as the representatives of the  affluent. Today, the modernisation of the Mandis and the development of  infrastructure for this purpose are being debated, but I would like to ask the  Government why the mandis have not been  set up at Gazipur, Azamgarh and  Sultanpur? I support the peaceful protests of the  farmers against three farm laws.  If the Government thinks that the farmers\\u201f  protest has tarnished the image of the country, let me tell you that the mighty  Government is only responsible for it.  Hon. Prime Minister, Shri Modi himself  said that India is the mother of democracy.  The Government should have  taken democratic steps to address the protest. In the case of ports and  airports, this Government is compromising the national security. The Congress Party has presented history  by distorting facts. They have mentioned about the session of Hindu  Mahasabha held in Bhagalpur. Meeting of Veer Savakar's Hindu Mahasabha  was held in the year 1941 and the Government of Bihar had not granted  permission. I have brought a copy of full resolution here. They have said in  that resolution about the policy of Congress Party that their policy is to divide  the country. Yesterday leader of opposition has mentioned about the  Government of India Act. He even not left the hon. President. Congress Party  had opposed the Government of India Act of the year 1919. After the  opposition of Congress Party, Rowlatt Act enacted. One of the Member of  TMC had made a major allegation about Article 121. I would like to say that  one should not produce any distorted facts. The farmers' agitation is no longer an issue  limited to Punjab or Haryana only. It has become a mass movement now. The  descendants of Shri Guru Tegh Bahadur are being dubbed traitors. Some  misguided youth came to Red Fort during the protests on 26.1.2021. The police  are arresting them and filing cases against them. These three agriculture laws  pertaining to farmers may please be taken back. Hold discussions. But eleven  rounds of talks have been fruitless. The farmers are protesting at Singhu border  and Tikri border of Delhi. The government thinks that they would go away due to  biting cold and inclement weather. Government is using barbed wires to make  the protesting farmers afraid. You are sadly mistaken. The hon. President, in his address, mentioned  about the incident that took place on 26th of January.  What makes me sad is that  in this protest, around 200 farmers died but it is not mentioned anywhere in the  Address. I hold the Government responsible for the death of those farmers.  The  hon. Prime Minister should hold talks with the farmers only then this problem can  be solved.  The Government talks about the self reliance of the farmers. However  80% of our farmers own less than 2 hectares of land.  Even today the farmers  are apprehensive about the laws.  If the Government will determine the MSP  then why there is no provision in the laws. Today our BSNL/MTNL services have  already reached villages, instead of supporting them, the Government handed  over these services to corporates.  Had the Government given this work to  BSNL/MTNL then the work would have been completed in a short time and both  companies would have been benefited financially.  However, there is no mention  about the steps taken to make BSNL/MTNL competent.  During corona, 30 to  40% of MSMEs faced closure and lakhs of people became unemployed.  But  there is no mention in the President\\u201fs Address as to what steps the Government  have taken for these unemployed people instead it gave permission to sell those  public sectors which were providing employment to the people.  On the one  hand, the Government says that there will be no written examination for Group  \\u201eC\\u201f and Group \\u201eD\\u201f categories however there are no jobs.  Recently all the  employees of Income Tax, Mint were recruited from outside the Maharashtra. Is it  fair or just?  Recruitment through Staff Selection Commission should also be  made within the state.  Three new laws were brought for the labourers, workers,  employees but unfortunately the provision of job security was removed.  There is  a reference regarding removal of Article 370 in the President\\u201fs Address. But till  date Kashmiri Pandits have not been able to settle there.  The dignity of the  officers of Judiciary and Executive should be maintained.  Marathi speaking  regions like Belgaum etc. of Karnataka State should be given the status of Union  Territory.  There are many castes in our country.  To ensure that no caste  remains deprived, a provision of reservation has been made in education and  jobs.  But even today Dhangar community is still deprived of reservation and  other facilities.  Similarly, in Maharashtra the Maratha Communtiy still remains  backward due to lack of economic development. Therefore, our demand to the  Union Government is that the percentage of reservation should be increased to  70% or more and the states should be given powers to make provision regarding  reservation for the backward classes and those communities which are deprived  even today.  We have to make this amendment in our Constitution.  Even such a  big issue is not mentioned in the President\\u201fs Address. Instead of keeping the promise of  doubling the farmers' income the government has reduced Rs 10000 crore of the  Kisan Samman Nidhi in the last budget. The Agricultural laws were framed for  farmers against which the farmers are protesting on dharna around Delhi for last  two and half months. They are demanding that these laws should be withdrawn  and an MSP law should be formulated for implementation this law is against poor  people. There are provisions in the law to provide benefit to big companies. They  can keep unlimited stock under the law but it has not been specified that it in the  market at which rate they will sell this stock to poor people. The tricolour flag was  dishonoured at the Red fort to defame the farmers and the person who did that  had good relations with the BJP MP of Punjab to stop the farmers from entering  Delhi spikes were installed on the roads and ditches were dug up. After strong  censure these spikes were removed. In UP sugarcane farmers are not getting  the payment in time. BSP government had paid interest on the payment of  farmers. In the current budget Rs 218 crore have been reduced as compared to  last budget for minority community.  The children of the farmers, who are being  called as traitors and Khalistani are working as the guards lying on the entire  borders of the country.  A farmer of the country can never be a traitor.  Unemployment and inflation have skyrocketed.  Not only the poor people but  lakhs of people in middle classes have lost their jobs and employment.  The  Government in its manifesto had promised to provide two crore employments,  but it utterly failed in fulfilling the said promise and under the pretext of  \\u201eAatmnirbhar Bharat\\u201f a false assurance has been floated there. First of all I would like to  congratulate the Hon\\u2018ble President for his Address given in the joint sitting of  Parliament.  Three quotations of three poets have been used in the Address  and the states to which these three poets belong, are going to have elections.   What is mentioned in these quotations is of utmost importance.  Hindustan  enjoys the status of a traditional nation.  It has always supported plurality.  Plurality accommodates differences, and differences embody and enact  dissent.  Therefore we should not be afraid of any debate or any dialogue or  any  dissent  because  our  civilization  always  encourages  dissent,  disagreement, debate, and dialogue.  I would also like to say that the  government should refer to all the great leaders of the Indian freedom  struggle.  Also, if we worship Bharat Mata, then people of every religion and  community also need to be taken together.  I would like to ask that why more  than 200 of our farmers have lost their lives during the ongoing farmer\\u2018s  protest.  Why this government is not talking to the farmers. We are unable to  bear the plight of our farmers. Therefore, it is our strong demand that at least  the issue of farmers should be discussed separately and by negotiating with  the farmer, the demand of the farmers should be met.  As far as the Red Fort  incident is concerned, it should be investigated by a joint parliamentary  committee.   The Government had given permission for the rally. The  responsibility for deteriorating condition of the law and order lies with the  Government. The Government has been filing fabricated cases against the  leaders of the farmer's movement. The Government has been trying to divide  the farmer's movement. This movement has become a people's movement  now. There is nothing wrong if a small girl of 18 has expressed her support for  the cause of farmers. India carried out an air strike at Balakot a few days after  the Pulwama attack. Not a single person of this country had information about  this strike. How come a journalist got prior information about this strike. This  has jeopardised our national security. We wish that a JPC be constituted to  investigate into the TRP scam. The Government has claimed that the  Hindustan Aeronautical Limited has been building Drone warriors. My  question is why this company was not given opportunity to build Rafael. The  Government should provide accurate information about what has been  happening in Leh and Ladakh, Arunachal and Sikkim and also tell us when we  will finally throw the Chinese army out of India. The President in his Address has not  highlighted that how reservation will be useful for the Schedule Castes,  Scheduled Tribes and Backward classes as per the constitution.  Gradually,  the Government is being sold to all public sector companies of the country.  It  will be irrelevant to talk about reservations when there are no public sector  companies.  Reservation should also be implemented in private sector jobs.   The Government should develop good employment oriented education  system for the bright future of the students.  Today, there is a farmer agitation  across the country, but Government wants to force legislation on the farmers  because of its stubbornness. Hon. Speaker Sir, an amount  of 10,000 rupees per hectare was deposited in the accounts of farmers as a  relief measure to offset the heavy losses faced by the farmers due to heavy  rainfall during October, 2020 in my Lok Sabha constituency.  Assistance of  25,000 rupees per hectare was provided to farmers whose lands were  washed away. But, the farmers have received no assistance at all from the  Union Government.  I request the Union Government that it should also grant  immediate assistance of 25,000 rupees to all the affected farmers.     Hon. Speaker, thousands of farmers from my constituency had insured  their Kharif crops under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna.  But, there is a  difficult provision that information about crop damage has to be given within  72 hours on the portal of the insurance company.  There was no electricity in  the villages for 20 or 30 days as the electric poles were washed away due to  which the farmers could not register their complaints online on the portal of  the insurance company and were not able to claim insurance. I urge the  Government to scrap the provision of registering online complaint within 72  hours and order the company concerned to give the insurance amount to the  farmers. The Government brought three black  laws when Corona pandemic was on the rise and got it passed without  consensus.  Ever since then, the farmers of Punjab and Haryana have been  protesting along with farmers from other states like U.P.  The black laws  pertaining to provisions related to marketing were anti-farmers.  The interests  of the farmers were sold to the capitalists and corporate.  They must be taken  back at the earliest.  The land belongs to the farmers.  He takes loan for  cultivating the land.  But cost of food grains is fixed by the Government.   Anyone should have the right to purchase farmers\\u2018 food grains.  Whether it is  the middlemen or private players.  You have imposed black laws on the  farmers.  But we strongly condemn the sad incidents that took place at Red  Fort on 26.01.2021.  We have great regard for the tricolor. The tricolor was  granted to you by Punjab. Today, the Press is under pressure from the  Government and the capitalists.  This Government has curbed the freedom of  the Press.  The capitalists have enslaved the executive, the judiciary and the  legislature.  The need of the hour is to free these institutions from the clutches  of capitalists.  The Government must take back all the black laws pertaining to  agriculture at the earliest and listen to the genuine demands of the farmers. At the outset, I would like to say  that the existence of a chit fund in this country after over 70 years of Independence  is actually a shameful thing.  It is because people want to have access to money in  case of an emergency and this is supposed to be met by a banking institution or an  NBFC.  But the banking institutions have failed to meet such requirement.   Unfortunately, banks give huge sums of money to big corporate but these people  are not repaying it and they become NPAs.  It is either in collusion with these  companies or something as a result of which the banks end up in such a situation  where the money is lost forever.  In these kinds of situations, no action is taken  against the erring banks.  If you see the quantum of this chit fund business, it is  about anything from Rs.30,000 to Rs.50,000 crore.  I feel this legislation is going  to bring down the chit fund business which will again lead to a lot of  unemployment.  The existing chit fund operators, who were earlier charged 10 per  cent, are now being charged 12 per cent GST.  They have been asking for  exemption from GST but the rate of GST in their case has been increased.  So,  people who are doing this business are losing their interest.  Consequently, a  number of chit fund companies are on the verge of closure.  So, I would request the  Government to consider if the individuals who are running chit funds for Rs. 3 lakh  can be exempted from GST.  It will be of a huge benefit to the small people. India is probably going  through one of its most difficult phases in the economy.  GDP at a 15 year low.   Unemployment is at a 45 year low.  The household consumption is four decades  low.  The bad loans are at all-time high.  Regarding this whole thing about scams, I  would like to ask as to how are we going to regulate it?  I am not doubting the  intent of this Government. I am sure, they are trying to stop these schemes but I do  not see it really happening anywhere.  They keep saying about Pradhan Mantri Jan  Dhan Yojana.  If they have done so well in it, probably tomorrow chit funds will  not even exist.  They talked about the Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill.  I would  like to know as to how much money has really come back to this country?  How  many offenders are really punished?  How much time or money do we engage in  people in financial literacy?  You talk about video conferencing but the way now- a-days calls are dropping, how will we do video conferencing?  Most of the  telecom companies are almost saying that they are bankrupt.  So, how are we going  to do video conferencing?  The solutions look wonderful on the Table.  But, they  have to be implemented on paper and into a reality because we are protecting the  poor people of this country.   We really need to have a financial literacy  programme.  If you could provide financial education within our educational  system, it will help more people. After the abolition of Article 370, a  war like situation has arisen.  This situation has been created by the Government.   The fact is when Article 370 was incorporated, maybe at that time it was the most  important and an effective step.  Maharaja Hari Singh had decided to merge  Jammu and Kashmir with India.  At that time, some concessions were given to  them.  So, it should not always be criticised saying that at that time Article 370 was  incorporated in a wrong way.  I feel that it could have been better if the matter had  been discussed with the leaders of all the political parties of the country before  going to take such a very crucial step which has shaken the country.  This step will  throw Jammu and Kashmir in a direction of more uncertainty.  We feel that Dr.  Farooq Abdullah, Shri Omar Abdullah, Madam Mehbooba Mufti, former Chief  Minister should be released immediately.  We feel that this Bill is against the  constitutional morality and a procedural hara-kiri has been committed.  Whether  we vote in favour or against the Bill-we will become the partner of this Bill. This  we do not want to become.  Hence, as the ultimate conclusion, we have decided to  walkout instead of opposing this Bill with a request that no atrocities should  happen in Jammu and Kashmir.   I rise to oppose this Bill.  This is a black day  for the relationship between Jammu and Kashmir and the Union of India.  Only the  time will decide whether this step is one worth celebrating or otherwise.  Article  370 does not give you the right to amend it.  The route which has been adopted is  an assault on Constitution.  With regard to the proposal regarding bifurcation or the  change in boundary, the people of the State must have an opportunity to give their  opinion.  Only after that, the Parliament could take a decision in this regard.   Object of the Government should be to connect the people.  This process had  started but you have pushed it back.  You claim that you have abrogated Article  370 but Mukherji Ji was part of the process of its coming into being.  Though, I  have never said that he had moved the resolution.  This is an assault on the  Constitution.  Your other claim is that it will facilitate development.  To this, I  want to say that Jammu and Kashmir is already a well-off state. The Parliamentary Affairs Minister said that he  lamented that the Congress Party had called this a black day.  Let me explain why  we think it is indeed a dark day for India's democracy.  The Government has  brought this Bill to this House without consultation with the local parties, with the  State Legislature our of Session for more than six months and with democratically  elected political leaders.  The claim that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of  India is also our claim.   There is no political divide on that proposition.  But the  way you have pursued that claim with this Bill is an affront to our very values as a  democracy, as a nation and it has already done serious damage to our international  standing.  I am sure you will get this Bill through this House very easily.  But the  tradition of consultation and deliberation will lie in sewage.  This is a breath-taking  betrayal of our democracy and nothing short of legislative authoritarianism.  Let us  look at the short-term damage which has already been done.  Tourism, the lifeline  of Kashmir, has been devastated.  Today, advisories are back in foreign countries;  tourists are out; shikara operators are out of business; handicraft makers and carpet  weavers are broke and the Amarnath Yatra has been rudely interrupted.  Now, let  us look at the medium-term consequences.  You may drive more misguided young  Kashmiris to join the militants than ever before and our brave jawans will be even  more in harm's way and in danger as a result of this action.  The international  implications are very serious for our country.  The UN has issued a statement  calling for restraint.  Is this not embarrassing for our nation?  In the process, we  have also jeopardized our claims to PoK because that rested on the question of the  accession of the whole State and now the whole State no longer exists.  The  Government is in the habit of portraying opposition to its initiatives as anti- national.  We are the original party of nationalism.  Nehruji has also been  demonized here.  There is a misleading record in the House.  Nehru ji did not do  anything on his own.  There were three accessions.  They are Hyderabad, Junagadh  and Kashmir.  All three had to be treated by Nehru ji and Sardar Patel together  without an exception.  I would also request the Home Minister to say whether he  would accept a request from my Party to lead or to conduct or to organize an all- party delegation to visit Kashmir and see for ourselves what the situation is on the  ground. The BJP has lived up to its electoral  promise in their manifesto, but they have not lived up to their constitutional duties.   This Bill is a violation of Article 3 of the Constitution of India.  Had this been done  by a Governor who did not belong to the BJP, the party would have raised the issue  of how a Governor is partial to the ruling party.  But now when the Governor is  working on the diktats of the Government, the BJP is quiet.  The Government says  that Article 370 was a temporary provision.  But in the State Bank of India versus  Santosh Gupta case and in the case of Safarullah, the Supreme Court held that  Article 370 is not \\u2018temporary\\u2019, it is a special status.  I want to know when I can go  and buy agricultural property in Himachal Pradesh and when I can go to Arunachal  Pradesh and Lakshadweep without a permit. I demand that the Government release  all prisoners and remove curfew and ensure that communication in the State  begins. The Bill is introduced for  regulation of the practice and process of surrogacy.  The global infertility rate is  also increasing.  As we are increasing the scientific technologies, surrogacy has  come into existence.  The eligibility criteria for intending couple are to mandatory  have as certificate of essentiality and a certificate of eligibility.  I would also like to  bring to your kind notice about some issues which are to be defined in this Bill.   Close relative is not defined.  The other point to be considered is authorization for  termination of pregnancy if in the process of surrogacy, sometimes the surrogate  mother of the intended couple do not want the surrogate child, the rules should also  be framed correctively. An abortion of the surrogate child requires written consent  of the surrogate mother and an authorization by the appropriate authority. If a child  being born out of surrogacy arrangement is at the risk of physical or mental  abnormalities, under the Bill, only the surrogate mother\\u2019s consent will be required  to abort the child.  This Bill does not allow the storage of embryo or gamete for  surrogacy.  This prohibition may have adverse health implications for the intending  mother. Though, the present generation has never  been a part of the freedom struggle but we respect the freedom struggle.  We  respect each and every freedom fighter.  The Jallianwala Bagh massacre, where  hundreds of Hindus were shot by General Dyer, was a shameful incident.  It pained  me to even imagine that.  Let us not try to change the history rather we should  write history and build India.  This Congress Party is the by-product of the earlier  Congress Party.  I request the Government to withdraw the Bill.    Several accidents took place in the  past due to improper maintenance of the dams. 670 dams in the country are located  at such places which fall in high seismic zones. The capacity of several dams are  declining due to deposition of silt.  Whether the Government proposes to take  some action in this Dam Safety Bill to extract silt from the rivers. There are several  instances of corruption in the construction of dams.  Stringent action must be taken  in such cases. The major cause of pollution in rivers is due to release of drainage  water in the rivers.  Today the quality of water in all the dams of the country has  declined with the rise of population. While acquiring land for Pavna Dam, the  farmers were promised to provide alternate land but till date Government has not  fulfilled its promise to provide land to the farmers of Maval. Government should  take care that the rights of the states may not be compromised as a result of this  Bill. I actually think that the present Bill is  half-sighted and lacks a broader perspective.  Take the case of the Brahmaputra  River system.  The Brahmaputra is the only main river in the whole world.  The  Chinese have built several big dams on it and hydro-power projects, and there are  unconfirmed reports that they are planning to divert the water to their dry areas.  If  China diverts the water of the Brahmaputra River in the Tibet region, then the  mighty river Brahmaputra is likely to dry out in the downstream areas. And then,  the famous biodiversity of the eastern part of India that we all know of will also  wither.  Livelihood of millions of people up to Bangladesh will be in jeopardy.  Jal  Shakti Mantralaya should arrange to have a multilateral agreement with different  countries.  Brahmaputra is not a one-state river. It flows through several countries  like China, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and of course India. So, why cannot we  have a multilateral agreement?  There has to be a reservoir regulation policy with  an international protocol. That is the need of the hour. I would like to thank you for giving me the  opportunity to speak on the Dam Safety Bill 2019.  Clause 5 of the Bill talks about  the composition of the National Committee on Dam Safety.  I am not happy the  Government is appointing only seven Members from 29 States and that too on a  rotation basis.  When we have representation of all the States in other forum like  GST Council, what is the harm in providing a similar provision in the National  Committee on Dam Safety?  The Polavaram project in the State of Andhra Pradesh  was given the status of the national project by the Union Government.  The  Polavaram project was first conceptualized in 1941 at a cost of Rs. 6.5 crore. In  2014, the Andhra Pradesh Re-origination Act declared it a national project and the  Polavaram Project Authority was set up.  In January 2019, we entered the Guinness  Book of World Records by pouring 32,100 cubic meters in 24 hours to complete  the major portion of the project.  Much of the money has already been spent and  we are waiting to be reimbursed by the Central Government.  The approved funds  of Rs. 55,000 crore should be released and the Polavaram project should be  completed in a time-bound manner. The Government is making the Central Water  Commission as the Chairman of the National Committee on Dam Safety. It would  mean that the CWC would function as the advisor and regulator.  The hon'ble  Minister, on record, has said that there are nearly 5400 large dams in the country.  Of this, 293 are more than 100 years old and 1000 dams are 50 to 100 years old. I  would like the hon'ble Minister to explain the House as to what he is going to do  under the proposed Bill for the structural and operational safety of these dams. None of us can approve of what happens to  our children.  None of us can accept that their entire future is taken away by people  who abuse them sexually.  I appreciate that the discrimination between gender has  been taken away in this Bill.  It is generally believed that it is only the girl child  who is affected which is far from the truth.  There are so many young boys who are  sexually abused.  This Bill does not talk about child prostitution.  It also has to be  addressed because there are so many children who are trafficked for prostitution  and are abused.  We agree that this legislation has been brought with the best of  intentions.  But this Bill should not become a deterrent for people to report the  crimes and for witnesses to turn hostile.  The Government has brought death  penalty into it.  The judge will be forced to directly question the child.  The child  being made to go into the details of the case will become another harrowing  experience for the child.  The entire nation believes that these people should be  shown no mercy.  Moreover, death penalty is not the answer to every crime in this  country.  Most of the countries are now moving away from this concept of  awarding death penalty.  The hon. Minister should send this Bill to the concerned  Departmentally Related Standing Committee or form a Select Committee and  bring the Bill back to the House. Primarily this Act was brought in the year 2016 to  handle the issue of NPAs in the Public Sector Banks.  The NPA issues are still  there and have gone worse.  There are about 50,000 employees in Jet Airways.  What happens to the employees?  The Act was brought with a very good intention  but what we have been able to achieve, we would like the hon. Minister to bring it  in the Parliament. Another issue which I want to bring to the notice of the  Government is that it has given 90 percent power to the financial creditors.   Another point which I want to impress upon the Government is that now many  stakeholders are raising the issue that there is a large possibility of misuse of the  new amendment.  It is because about 90 or 100 cases have been disposed of in the  last two and two and a half years of the Insolvency Law.  Around 80 cases have  been withdrawn.  So, we need to see this issue very seriously.  Lastly, I will  request the Government that increasing the time from 270 days to 330 days would  not make much difference unless we understand what the underlying issues are.   So, we need to differentiate between the severity of the cases. I would like to talk about the Cauvery water  dispute.  The Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal was formed in 1990.  As per the  interim award given in 1991, 205 tmc water was to be released to Tamil Nadu. But,  no water was released.  The final award was given in 2007.  It reduced the quantity  of water to be released to Tamil Nadu to 192 tmc.  Again, no water was given.  The  hon. Supreme Court further reduced this quantity to 177.25 tmc in the year 2018.   Even then, no water was released.  After struggling for 29 years, we have got a  Cauvery Management Board, but  today, the Government has brought this new Bill  saying that all the existing Tribunals will be wound up.  I would like to know what  will happen to Cauvery Management Board.  The people of Tamil Nadu have been  suffering for all these years.  My suggestion to the hon. Minister is that the  Government should nationalise the rivers so that it can resolve the disputes.  With  these words, I  oppose the Bill. Prima facie, it appears from a reading of  this Bill that the Bill is very innocuous, but it is not so.  It seems as if it is restricted  to the Members of Parliament, but it is not so. This Bill\\u2019s effect is up to the ground  level public servants.  Now, the main objection is that he is going to the court.  Let  us assume that a person has been dismissed from service illegally, and he goes to  the court to get a stay. Do you think that the court is granting stay blindly unless a  case is made out by someone?  I am saying that it is a draconian law.  Unbridled  discretionary power has been entrusted or given to the Estate Officer. This power,  which has been given under Clause 4, is capable of being exercised arbitrarily. One  Estate Officer will fix a particular amount as damage and another Estate Officer  will fix another amount as damage.  There needs to be clarification on certain  points.  Suppose a dismissal has taken place. A person has gone to the court.  He  has not got the stay immediately. He is staying in the accommodation. After six  months, he has succeeded in the case. Will you evict him?  Or will you impose  damage?  Will that period be treated as unauthorized? Secondly, how much time  are you giving to him?  It must be of statutory one.  One must know this.  Clause 4  of the Bill is a draconian law and I am opposing this Bill on this ground because  the estate officer is given unbridled capricious power to impose damage without  laying down the guidelines and it is capable of being exercised arbitrarily. Generally, dispute resolution has not  been very effective.  There have been long delays in adjudication.  The States have  not complied with the verdicts of Tribunals.  The Supreme Court does not have  jurisdiction over it.  So there is a need to allow the Supreme Court to come into  dispute resolution mechanism.  The constitution of Dispute Resolution Committee  is a good provision.  But its benefits will depend on the mechanism's efficiency.  The experience of data bank has not been very encouraging because there are  disputes relating to data that is provided.  The challenge is to implement the award  of the Tribunal. Cauvery Water Dispute Tribunal award is a case in point.  The  award was given in 2007 and is yet to be implemented.  The River Boards Act of  1956 has become a dead letter.  The ad-hoc mechanism like river authority,  supervisory committee etc. have proved ineffective.  It has been provided in the  Bill that the decision of the Tribunal would be final and binding.  This flies in the  face of due process of law. The Government is bringing this  Bill to establish CCPA to look into the grievances of the consumers.  'Mediation' as  an Alternative Dispute Resolution Mechanism has been provided for in the Bill.  I  would like to know from the hon. Minister the definition of 'Mediation' as it is not  defined in the Bill. However, I would like to appreciate the Government for  carrying out multi-media campaign, namely 'Jago Grahak Jago' on pan-India  basis.  I would also like to know as to how much funds have the Central  Government released for particularly to my State Andhra Pradesh for creating  awareness among the consumers?  The Bill does not address the fundamental  problem of protracted and complicated litigation, the bane of consumers.  The  patient is also a consumer.  Earlier, healthcare was not included in the service list  of the Bill.  I appreciate the Government for including healthcare in the list.  There  is a penalty of Rs. 10 lakhs and up to two years imprisonment, if any manufacturer  or an endorser gives false or misleading advertisement.  I would request the hon.  Minister to increase the penalty amount to Rs. 25 lakhs for initial false or  misleading advertisement.  For the subsequent offence, the penalty imposed may  be up to Rs. 1 crore.  CCPA can also prohibit the endorser or manufacturer for  misleading advertisement.  However, there are certain exceptions mentioned when  endorser will not be held liable for such a penalty.  I want to know from the hon.  Minister as to what those exceptions are.  There is no time frame for disposal of  cases.  Consumer complaints should be disposed of in less than 90 days. If Government is really  honest to the commitment, will you make sure that the salaries are paid for all the  PSUs and people who work in Air India, who work for the Government but do not  get raises or any protection? While codifying labour laws, labour interests should  not be overlooked. So, I think, this is something very important point that this  Government needs to understand.  The Government should clearly spell out as to  how it is going to protect the interests of the workers in unorganized sectors.  Just  making rules is very easy. But how are you going to implement them, and what is  the mechanism that you are going to use for this?  I would like to know what  would be the minimum wages in different states?  I would like to know what are  you going to do for SEZs?  We have had problems about SEZs several times. So,  how are you going to address it? You have said that there would be bonus for 20 or  more employees. The Standing Committee has recommended for 10 employees.  So, I would urge you to reconsider 10 employees because I see no reason why this  Government, which makes tall claims, should not do it.  Our country is very  complex in regard to providing jobs. Today, there are nearly 429 scheduled  employments and 1,915 scheduled job categories for unskilled workers.  This  massive expansion of job categories has led to a major variation.  So, how would  you come to a Minimum Wage Programme when India is such a complex country?   This Bill is a welcome step.  You are trying to do innovative things in the  Government. But you must pay salaries to the PSU employees and do think of  thousands of workers in the Air India today, who are contractual workers and are  not getting fair choice or salaries. In the year 2014, there was a shortage of 4 lakh  doctors, 9 lakh nursing and para-medical staff in the country.  After all it was  whose responsibility to make available expert medical doctors and quality health  care.  Obviously, the then Governments were responsible for it, however, they  miserably failed.  Medical education became commercialized and corruption  rampantly prevailed. Our Government understood the ground reality and necessary  curative measures were taken.  Tourism has got 6.8 per cent share in our GDP.   There has been 25 per cent growth in our medical tourism.  Medical tourism has  got vast potential in India but we cannot achieve much in medical tourism unless  expert medical doctors are available in adequate numbers. Prior to introduction of  this Bill, our Government took several critical steps which have proved to be  milestones in this field and their positive results are also there.  In the year 2009,  Yashpal Committee recommended that accountability of the MCI should be fixed.   Thereafter, the then Minister introduced this Bill in Lok Sabha on 20th December,  2017.  During the last three years, as many as 121 new medical colleges have been  set up, out of which 61 are in public sector and 60 are in private sector.  There are  in all 536 medical colleges in the country and during the last three years alone, 121  medical colleges have been set up which is an eye opener.  Our Government has  also opened new medical colleges in 80 districts and 39 out of these 80 medical  colleges have become functional.  Earlier, a medical college had maximum 150  seats which has been increased upto 250 with 25 per cent increase in MBBS seats  and 33 per cent increase in post graduate seats during the last 4 years.  There was  shortage of teachers also.  Therefore, our Government increased the retirement age  from 65 to 70.  MCI had a rule that student professor ratio should be 1:1. We made  that as 1:2 and 1:3.  Earlier, every medical college had its own system.  In reality,  they had their own shops.  They had their own examination, own master and own  examiner.  Our Government standardized the medical education and introduced the  NEET examination for admission in MBBS across the country and nobody can  raise any question on this examination.  Several queries were raised regarding  community health provider.  Community Health Provider and basic medicines is a  recognized system world over.  The trained nurses can prescribe certain basic  medicines in the whole world.  A Commission has been set up in this regard and  whatever issues crop-up in future will be addressed there under.  Our next NEET  exam will be for admission in MBBS, licentiate exam and also entrance exam for  PG seats.  Students will get two-three opportunities for improving their marks.   The Bill provides for 25 members in the proposed Commission and out of 25  members, 21 will be doctors.  NGOs will also have their representation in the  Commission.  The bridge course under allopathic practicing system has been  discontinued.  It has been observed that the incidents of assaults on doctors have  increased in our country.  I would, therefore, exhort the people to keep in mind the  feeling of humanity in this regard.  There are about 80,000 MBBS seats in the  country, at present.  Out of these seats, 75 per cent seats are under regulation and  only 25 per cent are unregulated.  Some people had sent me certain queries and  suggestions in this regard which I have referred to hon. Minister for his  consideration.  With these words, I support this Bill. In the MCI all the members had been  elected by the doctors themselves.  Now, under the National Medical Commission  Bill, it will be totally a selected body and it will be selected by the Government of  India.  Such a step is surely going to introduce bureaucratic interference and  favouritism in the proposed Commission.  The powers of the State Governments  are being curbed.  All the powers relating to health is being taken over by the  Central Government.  This Bill favours private colleges so marginalized students  must not be overlooked.  Equal opportunities must be ensured for deserving and  disadvantaged background candidates.  Government should ensure free healthcare  for all the citizens of this country.    For the last 70 years, our medical system has been  somewhat like the mix of American and the British systems.  Indian doctors are the  best doctors in the world.  The doctor patient ratio in our country is slightly  skewed.  It is almost to the tune of one doctor is to 1600 patients.  This National  Medical Commission will be a game changer in the medical system.  Most of the                                                              * Please see supplement.   doctors who have opposed this Bill, have not even read the Bill and they have got  the knowledge from the social media.  They should first study the Bill then seek  clarifications. This Bill is snatching away the  rights of the State Government. At the time of drafting the National Educational  Policy or while setting up the National Medical Commission, NMC, this Union  Government has decided unilaterally through an autocratic approach, without  worrying to get the consent of the State Government in this regard. MCI is a  professional and elected body. The National Medical Commission is bring  proposed to be set up by mostly Bureaucrats. A Government can be considered  good only when it provides medical care to people and education to students free  of cost. NEET makes school education useless. Now NEXT makes five year                                                              * Original in Tamil  medical education useless for students. I would therefore say that we do not want  NEET, NEXT and NMC. If we go through the Bill we will come to know that  be it constituting the search committee or nominating the members, the  Government is trying to centralize everything through this Bill.  Section 45 and 46  say that Central Government's direction to the Commission and the State  Government will be final.  Hence, State Governments have no role.  Actually no  autonomy has been given to the Commission and the States.  The Bill   has no  provision for the involvement of States or any other agency. It does not specify the  qualification also.  The Government has introduced a common final year exam  NEXT.  The Government is trying to intervene into U.G.C. also through this Act.   There is a need to ponder over the Bill again.  Therefore, the Bill should be sent to  Select Committee before passing it.     I request the hon. Minister that the private  companies should be given some relaxation in compliance of the Clause 7 of this  Bill.  The Clause 33 empowers the Government to declare a manager unfit and in  such circumstances the individual cannot work with any company for a period of  five years.  I feel the Government has adopted an unreasonably strict attitude and it  will create problems for certain individuals. As water is a State subject, the State  Governments need to be consulted before preparation of this Bill but it has not  been done.  That is why, I oppose the introduction of this Bill.                                                                * Hon. Members may kindly let us know immediately the choice of language (Hindi or English) for obtaining        Synopsis of Lok Sabha Debates. I strongly oppose the  introduction of the Bill.  There is a rules and procedure of this House.  The rights  of the House is being encroached and there is interference time and again.  There is  a tradition to send the Bills in Standing Committee, Select Committee which are  being passed.  Do not pass the Bills in this manner. I rise to oppose the introduction of this Bill.   The instant Triple Talaq has already been declared unconstitutional by the  Supreme Court and is therefore non est. As per this Bill, a Muslim man can be  jailed for upto three years along with a fine.  This provision has the potential to  destroy a marriage because of a false complaint by a scheming relative.  Besides,  this Bill is in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution as it discriminates Muslim  women and women of other religions.  The Ordinance also provides for  maintenance of the wife.  But, if the husband is in jail, how will he be able to  provide subsistence allowance?   Even the Supreme Court, in the Triple Talaq  Judgment, nowhere said that Triple Talaq should be a criminally punishable  offence.   This Bill is laid with a political intention to harass the Muslim  community and to portray Islam, the religion of peace and equality, in bad light.  If  the present Government is serious and sincere towards Muslim women  empowerment then it should come forward to address the issues of their  employment, education and technical skills and above all how will they be given  representation in local bodies, State Assemblies and Parliament.  Therefore, I  oppose this Bill and request the Government to send this Bill to the Standing  Committee for review and make laws for separated women of all communities, not  just Muslims. I rise to express my deep reservations,  complete opposition and total disappointment with regard to the Muslim Women  (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019. I begin by questioning as to why this  Government is in such a hurry to bring this Bill.  We are passing Bills here without  enough representation of women. So, please pass the 33 per cent Women\\u2019s  Reservation Bill before the Government talks about women\\u2019s rights.  Have we  even thought of bringing a Bill to end honour killings which happen in the name of  caste and religion?  Have we brought a law to punish people who indulge in mob  lynching and mob violence in the name of religion?  This is the need of the hour  and there is an urgency to bring Bills to check such incidents.  This law is short- sighted, discriminatory and divisive.  When the Supreme Court in the Shayara  Bano Vs. Union of India case has outlawed the triple talaq, talaq-e-biddat, then  what is the need for this Government to bring this legislation?   There are blatant  deficiencies in this Bill.  One is the penal provision in the present Bill under  Section 4, which provides for an imprisonment of up to three years and a fine.   What is more interesting is this.  Section 79(c) of the Bill prescribes preconditions  for the bail, which are not in accordance with the legal principles of this country.  I  would also like to ask the Government that why it is only concerned about Muslim  women in this country?  Why it is not concerned about Hindu women or Christian  women?  Rather, I would say that our domestic violence laws are stronger than  your Bill and they protect the Muslim women also.  Let me know talk about rights  of women, about their marital relationship.  So, I would like to know about their  stand on rape laws within a marriage?  The statistics prove that there are more  Hindu women abandoned in this country as against Muslim women.  This  Government is doing nothing for them.  So, this Bill is brought entirely to target  one community, one religion and we will not allow the minorities of this country to  feel insecure. The Supreme Court had pronounced the talaq- e-biddat as unconstitutional.  A number of other judgments delivered by the  various courts of our country are also there which have pronounced this practice as  unconstitutional.  But, there is not a single judgment where it has been said that the  Government should make the talaq-e-biddat a criminal offence. It clearly  demonstrates that the purpose of this Government is to demonize and penalize the  Muslim men.  The Government should have provided protection to the Muslim  women by bringing them under the ambit of the Domestic Violence Act, 2005.   We, therefore, demand that the Government should bring this Bill in a  constitutionally appropriate manner. The Constitution of India provides equal rights and  equality for the people of all religions.  This Bill is aimed to target and to make a  negative impact on the Muslim minorities.  I support the cause that the women                                                              * Original in Tamil  should be given equal status. The marriage laws should be common.  The  Government is not worried about other Marriage laws. The Government is not  concerned about bringing a legislation to prevent honour killings.  I want to stress  that a special law should be legislated to check this menace.  The national leaders  instilled confidence among the minorities ensuring that their lives will be  protected.  In order to instill such a confidence in their minds, laws like these  should not be implemented.  I oppose this Bill. I stand here to oppose the Unlawful  Activities (prevention) Amendment Bill. The amendments in the Bill intend to give  absolute powers to the Government. That is why, it has become more dangerous.  The power of designating an individual as a terrorist on the basis of suspicion  alone is dangerous. People have spent years and years in jails because of wrong  implications. The Act does not contain provisions for anticipatory bail. In the  current political climate, an emphasis on human rights will be seen as anti-national.  Failure to get bail means that the person has spend his entire time in jail. The  burden of proof under UAPA is on the person accused. It is now for the person  accused to prove his innocence. I stand to oppose the Bill because this  Bill violates articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. One can only be called a  terrorist after a court convicts him. Clause 11 of the Bill seeks to insert \\u2018as  amended from time to time\\u2019. This is compromising the Parliament\\u2019s sovereignty. I  strongly oppose this clause 11. Security Council resolution 1535 says that any law  you make to counter terrorism must comply with international human rights. That  is also violated in this Bill. As regards the provision regarding seizure of property,  how can NIA take the State property? That is a violation of federalism. This Bill  provides for police detention for six months. This is too much. I hope that this  Government will have a zero tolerance on miscarriage of justice. I strongly oppose the Bill.  This  Bill should be completely withdraw.  In the name of checking terrorism, this Act is  used by the Government to impose terror against the people, democratic forces,  intelligentsia, media persons to punish those who are against the Government. This  amendment is therefore too dangerous.  It will lead to destruction of the real fabric  of democracy.  This amendment Bill should be referred to the Standing Committee  of Parliament. Chit funds are operating in our country  right from 1982.  There are regulatory agencies.  But unauthorized chit funds are  also being run in our country.  Why the regulatory agencies like Reserve Bank of  India and SEBI did not act on them?  Had they taken some action, we would not be  facing this situation now.  These chit funds were allowed to be run without having  any licence.  The Government should put a blanket ban on all chit funds.  I have  only one point to make in respect of the Bill. Law and order comes under the  Seventh Schedule, List II, Entry I. If any offence is committed, States have the  power regarding that. The reference made by the competent authority under sub- Section 1 shall be deemed to be with the consent of the State Government. The  Government is, therefore, interfering with the power of the states. I have another  thing to say as to why the people are running for chit funds, ponzi funds etc. The  ground reality is that everyday the Government is deducting the rate of interest. If  the Government wants to stop it, it should give people higher rate of interest. I  have heard so many things about Saradha and Rose Valley but why the trail has not  commenced yet? Today the Government has brought the  Bill in this regard but the scamsters do not have to work hard to duple the people.  It would be wrong if we blame these companies alone because Reserve Bank of  India, SEBI, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Income Tax Department and  Economic Offences Wing are equally responsible for not taking any action despite  occurrence of such cases in large numbers. It is the responsibility of the  Government to assure people that if such company appears with same type of  schemes, the Government will be held responsible.  The Government should  consider the concept of Islamic bank because there are several such people in the  country who are not depositing their money in the banks. The Government has not carried out  even one  of the amendments suggested by the Select Committee. The penalty to be imposed  for non-compliance of the safety standards is insignificant. The State  Government\\u2019s rights are being taken away. The Tamil Nadu Government had  nationalized all the buses in 1969 so that there is a last mile connectivity. But, if  the Central Government now interferes and brings in private players, this will  completely ruin the State Government\\u2019s policy. If the Bill is passed, the State  Governments will not be able to enter into an Inter-State agreement with the  neighbouring States. I would like to know as to how many blackspots have been  rectified. The Minister has shifted the whole authority and power to the dealers.  The Minister has said that if you know how to drive, it is enough; you don\\u2019t need  educational qualifications to become a driver. I think that you need basic literacy  and education to be able to operate these vehicles and to read the signs and to  communicate with the people.   We are glad that he has been elected for this post.   On behalf of my party Biju Janata Dal, I assure him that he will never face any  problem from our side in running the House.  I would like to add that the practice  of sending the bills to the Standing Committee for legislative scrutiny has been  decreased.  Further, I wish that he will protect us from a dominant Government  which has been elected to run the country. I would like to term this 2019-20  Budget as a \\u201cJumla Budget\\u201d.  Unemployment is a burning issue before the country.   There is no initiative taken on such an issue.  Kisans of our country have been  facing serious problems for not getting the MSP of their produced things.  A  farcical dole of less than 17 rupees per day has been allocated for the poor kisans  of our country.  Workers\\u2019 long standing demand of wages of not less than 18,000  rupees has been absent in the Budget speech.  The allocation in the MGNREGA is  decreased.  I urge upon the Central Government to allocate more funds for this  Flagship Programme for all the country and as well for the State of Tripura.  In the  name of workers\\u2019 pension it is an exercise in deceit without there being any  scheme.  26 Lakh Anganwadi workers and helpers are absolutely neglected in the  Budget.  ASHA and Mid-Day meal workers are also neglected.  This Budget really  decreased the allocation for the North East Region.  Tripura is neglected seriously.   Due to lack of work, starvation deaths has come again in the State of Tripura.  The  Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council is not getting the requisite  money from the Government. Upgradation and maintenance of National Highways  and State roads are neglected.  For the development of the State of Tripura, I urge  for more allocation in the 2019-20 Union Budget. We had high hopes from  this Government when it was formed five years back when so many things were  promised to us including 'Special Status' for Andhra Pradesh.  Today, I stand in  total contrast to my feelings.   The present Government has come up with a  Budget where they want to woo the votes.  One of the priorities of our demand  is the Special Status for Andhra Pradesh.  Whatever we have been asking is  something which has been promised by the previous Central Government and  the present Prime Minister also.    The Government has misled the country by  saying that the States which have already been getting Special Status would not  get any more benefits after 2015, which is also wrong.  The States of the North- East are getting all the benefits under the Special Status name.  Our  Chandrababu Naidu ji has just asked to implement the Andhra Pradesh  Reorganisation Act.  I reiterate my demand of railway zone in Uttar Andhra  Region.  The Government of India had given Rs.350 crore to seven districts of  the State under the backward districts fund but they have taken it back.  They  are saying that there is a lot of corruption happening in the State.  This is not  true.  There are 600 programmes where Andhra Pradesh is leading the country.    Apart from the other demands, there is a demand of Amravati also.  We have to  build our own Capital and we need sufficient funds for that.  Polavaram project  is the lifeline of Andhra Pradesh.  The State Government has taken the  responsibility of building the Polavaram.  There are so many things like  Duggirajapatnam Port and Kakinada petrochemical complex that are still  pending under the Act.  Now, we want to go together to fight for the justice.   This kind of injustice is not just happening with Andhra Pradesh.  We have seen  that this kind of injustice is happening with all States.  CBI, ED, IB, these kinds  of institutions are being misused and they are sent on to the opposition to kill  the opposition.  This is not good for this democracy.  The Government is giving  Rs.6000 per year to the farmers but this is done only to woo the votes.  The  Government is afraid to release the data of farmers committing suicides,  unemployment data and any kind of economic report. The Central Government  keeps saying that they have granted 11 institutions to Andhra Pradesh but there  are a couple of other institutions that need to be set up there. Approximately  Rs.12,000 crore worth of land has been given.  An amount of Rs.12,000 crore  more is required to be put in by the Central Government to construct these  institutions.  A lot of such issues are pending.  I hope the Government realises  that the country is about the people as said by the great Telugu poet Garazada  Apparao.  PROF. RICHARD HAY:  The Central Interim Budget is not only poor and  farmer oriented, but also is pro-women and its main thrust is inclusive growth. Due  to the present fiscal management and control, fiscal deficit and inflation have been  maintained judiciously for the good of the country. The NPA defaulters are paying  up and bank transactions have become transparent. The FDI influx has been  increasing due to the effective financial policies executed by the Government of  India. International financial institutions have been complimenting the country's  economy. The Government has extended welfare measures to the poor by bringing  down the prices of food and other necessities, cardiac stents, medicines and houses.  The MSP has been increased by one and a half time the cost price for 22 types of  crops. Additionally, through DBT, Rs. 6000 is credited in the accounts of farmers.  The Government's has decided to extend a helping hand to the unorganised sector  by providing a sum of Rs. 3000 as part of social security measures. The youth of  the country has been supported by this Government by way of Skill Development  Programmes, Mudra Loans, Start up, Stand up, Make in India, Entrepreneurial  Development, etc. Record making construction of highways, inland waterways,  railway tracks and airport to facilitate regional connectivity throughout the country  has strengthened infrastructure in the country. This Government has protected the  lives of millions of poor patients by providing free healthcare through the most  visionary project - \\\"Ayush Bharat\\\". This Budget provides support to the middle- class tax payers and the real estate sector is also given a boost. On the whole this  Budget is development-oriented. The Interim Budget has featured with exaggerated  promises and failed to address the problems faced by farmers, common people,  unemployed youth, and the weaker sections in the country.  The Budget also  proved that the Government is insensitive to the plight of Kerala, which has been  virtually devastated by the recent flood.  At this difficult juncture, we expected a  helping hand from the Central Government in this Budget.  But our hopes have  gone astray when the Government ignored the rebuilding of Kerala and no package  has been declared.  Hollow promises have been made for farmers in the country.   Under the 'Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN)', the beneficiary  will get five hundred rupees every month.  This meager amount will do nothing to  help the farmers in the country.  Instead of it the Government should have rolled  out a loan waiver scheme and increased Minimum Support Price for agricultural  produces. It is learnt that under the 'Pradhan Mantri Shram-Yogi Maandhan' 32  crore workers above 40 years of age are out of the Scheme.  This is injustice to the  majority of workers in the country.  Not only that, a subscriber of this pension  scheme at the age of 18 will get a pension amount of Rs. 3000 after 42 years. The  Government has miserably failed to address the real issues, such as unemployment,  inflation, skyrocketing prices of petroleum products etc.  The NDA had promised  to create two crore jobs per annum.  But what is the present condition of  employment in the country?  The Government has failed to create more job  opportunities.  Instead of tackling the issue of unemployment through  implementing a proper scheme, the Government tries to hide the actual figures.  The Government is deliberately derailing MGNREGS for political reasons.  The  allocation for the Scheme is 1.8 per cent compared to the allocation last year.  If  the MGNREGS is properly implemented it will be able to arrest the unemployment  among the rural youth.  The Aayushman Bharat is claimed to be the largest scheme  of its kind in the world.  As per estimation, an amount of Rs. 120000 crore is  required to properly implement the Scheme.  But the Government has allocated  only Rs. 6400 crore for the Scheme. I wonder how the Government can make each  and every citizen 'Aayushman' by spending such a paltry amount.  As the people in  Kerala are vulnerable to communicable diseases, the Government didn't declare  AIIMS for the State.  No assistance has been allocated to support public sector  undertakings functioning in Kerala.  The plight of rubber growers has been  neglected by the Government.  Rubber is the backbone of Kerala's economy, the  negligence on the part of the Government will have an adverse impact on our  economy.  I take this opportunity to repeat my request on Sabarimala issue in  Kerala.  The recent judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court is against the customs  and traditions that have been observed by the devotees for a longtime.  I request  the Government to kindly initiate a legislative measure to protect the custom at  Sabarimala Shrine. This interim budget is not interim at all  and it is a gimic as any Government proposal or project.  Approximately 70 per  cent of our country's population is relating to farming and are farmers. They are in  great distress; thousands and thousands of farmers have committed suicide because  of failure of earning out of farming. Giving dole of meagre amount of Rs. 6000/-  per year or 17 paise/day is really an insult and of no use. They do not want dole,  they are working hard to earn, let Government try to decrease the price of fertiliser  and irrigation cost and electricity cost. Some lollypop is offered to low and middle  income individuals, asha workers, home buyers, builders, unorganised sector  workers. Government is shedding crocodile tear for unorganised sector labourers.  Government has sanctioned Rs. 3000/- per month of pension for them after  attaining 60 years of age which is very low. Pension value should be at least five  thousand for unorganised sector workers. They need free healthcare facility,  education for their children. There is hardly any increase in job opportunities for  the youth. Government hardly cares for health of mass population, budget  allocation in health sector is not up to mark. There is rather decreased budget  allocation to Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, mid-day meal etc; cut in minority welfare  schemes. Environmental pollution and eco-balance are not a great threat to  agricultural production, fisheries and public health. Air pollution is increasing lung  cancer, global warning causes drought, flood etc.  In this budget, there is no  mention regarding this. Demonetisation and ill-planned GST implementation have  caused problems. This budget is totally an eye wash and it is deliberately designed  with an eye towards ensuing general election 2019. The Interim Budget's focuses on cows  instead of working class.  Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maandhan Yojana that  promises a monthly pension of Rs. 3000 per month for all workers, as well as Rs.  6000 per year cash transfer  to all farmers who own two hectares or less land.  Allocation needs to be increased to put an end to the ongoing rural crises. The  allocations under PMGSY have to be increased for better connectivity in rural  India. The Interim Budget had little in store for the energy sector, Ujjwala Scheme,  Saubhagya Scheme, Maulana Azad fund and Kolkata Metro, etc. No clarity on  Good and Service Tax (GST) import duties or tax relief. I do not support this  Interim Budget. The entire country is aware of the fact that  the Muslims have the least literacy rate of 68 per cent.  Even the data of NSSO also  corroborate the fact.  The Government's Strategic Document, 2018 itself reveals  that the Muslim students constitute 4.43 per cent of the total out of school children  which is the highest.  The share of Muslims in the formal employment sector  stands as much as 3.82 per cent.  I think it is imperative for me to mention here that  the modernization of madarsas figured in the manifesto of the BJP but contrary to  it, the budget for it has been slashed by Rs. 250 crore.  Moreover, the budgetary  provision for the post matriculation scholarship for the Scheduled Castes,  minorities and Other Backward Castes has been reduced by 60 per cent, 23 per  cent and 17 per cent respectively.  The Government has provided Rs. 750 crore for  the Rashtriya Gokul Mission.  At last, I would like to say that this Government has  scrapped the provision of Haj Subsidy.  Thus, this Government  does not have any  affection for Muslims and it has deceived them in the name of triple talaq. The people of the North Eastern states of  India i.e. Assam, Manipur, Mizoram, Meghalaya etc. strongly object the passing of  the Citizenship Amendment Bill 2016. Government's attitude towards the  minorities of the North Eastern states clearly implies that their voice and  sentiments were not attended. As regards making serious efforts to identify  talented sports persons from different corners of the country, the Government has  failed to mention any positive steps for materialization of the recently approved  Central Sports University of Manipur. The Government has failed to understand  that the extension of 7th Pay Commission only to the Central Government  Employees, which they deemed a landmark achievement, is deplorable. The  Government has failed to address the problems of state Governments.  Under the provisions of the Article 87 of the  Constitution the point of discussion remains the government but the matters are  delineated by the hon. President, hence my constructive, truthful and critical  speech will be directed not towards President's Address but towards the  government.  On the lines of the British rulers, the government is threatening us to  toe its line or face the music.  This is what has recently happened to West Bengal.   Today the rate of unemployment is 6.1 per cent, which is much more than four  decades of unemployment put together.  According to CMIE survey, 3.5 million  jobs were lost due to demonetization.  There is huge resentment among the people.   Four things namely demonetization, unemployment, agriculture crisis and ruining  the economy of this country altogether will throw them out of power in the ensuing  elections.  If they want to learn how to run the government and how to implement  schemes properly, they should go through the schemes being implemented by the  West Bengal Government.  The way legislative process is being undertaken by the  Government has totally undermined our Parliamentary system.  The hon. President  has mentioned about the concept of New India.  The present regime's concept of  New India is about destroying democracy, democratic institutions, destroying  Constitution of India, sabotaging the new generation, creating fear and about  finishing federal structure.  Further unemployment, agriculture crisis, destroying  RBI and CBI, bulldozing Bills in the Parliament without discussion, fake data and  pseudo patriotism speak volumes of its New India. I name this Budget the Band-Aid Budget for  which this regime has no accountability to deliver on.   The TDP walked out of the  NDA and the Government following being totally ignored in the Budget 2018-19.   Hon. Prime Minister had promised that if NDA comes to power, Andhra Pradesh  would be given a Special Category Status for ten years, but the people of Andhra  Pradesh have been betrayed.    The fight for the rights of Andhra Pradesh has  grown into a fight to 'Save Democracy'.   I demand that the Government of India  should immediately release a 'White Paper' on what it has done with regard to the  implementation of Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act and assurances given by  then Prime Minister, Shri Manmohan Singh ji, in the Rajya Sabha.   Instead of  waiving off loans of the farmers, the Government in the Budget announced that it  would give Rs.17 a day.  How does Rs.6000 a year help a farmer who is in a debt  trap and contemplating suicide?  Farmers' income in Andhra Pradesh has doubled  in the last four years.  The agriculture growth rate is 11 per cent against the  national average of just two per cent.    The PM boasted that he would create two  crore jobs a year but as many as five lakh Government jobs are lying vacant in  various departments.  According to NSSO's latest job survey, unemployment rate is  at 40 year high at 6.1 per cent.  Now, NITI Aayog is trying to push this Report  under the carpet because of upcoming elections and to cover up the failure of the  Government.  This Regime is openly embarking on a path of cultural nationalism  and wishes to define a single national identity and culture for  India.  They are  trying to give a very narrow definition of what it means to be an Indian.  This  Government has passed an Order authorising 10 Central Government Agencies to  monitor, intercept, and decrypt any information generated, transmitted, received, or  stored in any computer source without any approval from any authority of the  Government of India.  Earlier, the approval of the Joint Secretary was to be taken  for any interception or tapping.  But it has been done without proper discussion or  consensus.  The above Order is a clear violation of Privacy.  This Government  actions over the last five years, be it relating to AP's rights, demonetization,  improper implementation of GST, is proving to be a destroyer of Democracy. The Government spares just 1.28 per  cent of the GDP for public healthcare, way less than the global average of 6 per  cent. Rs. 3 per day is spent on an average Indian's healthcare. I regret while  speaking about the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, he did not address the problem  of continued preference of using firewood and traditional biomass fuels. Many  people with new connections are not buying refilled cylinders after their first one  runs out. The nation has been misled into believing that the government has  fulfilled its promise of fixing the Minimum Support Price-MSP at one and a half  times higher than the production cost of the crop. The unemployment rate of in the  country has been at a 45-year high since 1972-73 a period from when the jobs data  is comparable. On the front of welfare of tribals, I regret that there is no mention of  welfare schemes for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes population of the  nation. GST has adversely impacted the implementation of social security and  welfare schemes for 8.5 lakh Kendu Leaf pluckers, seasonal workers and binding  workers engaged in the trade. The government failed to provide Rs. 1000 crore to  the Government of Odisha as interim assistance for taking up relief and restoration  of work of immediate nature to the affected people of cyclone Titli. This is the last session of  this Government and I am sure that this Government is not going to come back.   The Government should also restore 200 point roaster system.  13 point roaster  system is against the welfare of SC/ST and OBCs.  I would also like to demand  that caste census should be conducted.  Rights of SCs/STs and OBCs should be  safeguarded.  This Government has promoted intolerance.  It has also not provided  adequate employment opportunities to the youth of this country. Hon'ble President spoke on different  issues and achievements of the Government specially on M.S.P., Rafale Jet deal,  surgical strike, demonetisation, 10 per cent reservation of general category poor,  tripple talaq, etc. but practically the outcome is not up to the mark. About doubling  farmer's income, attempting a permanent solution faced by farmers and minimum  support price of 22 crops is not correct. The Government also failed on  demonetisation and black money. RBI figures shows that 99.6 per cent of the  demonetised notes had returned to the banking system. It was also mentioned that a  new airport would be opened at Jharsuguda on 22.10.2018, but unfortunately no  flights was operational till date. Farmers have been literally surviving  on loans.  A debate is going on whether farm loan waiver is the right answer to  address farmers woes?    How will the State Governments bear the fiscal burden?     Where will the money come from?    Telangana launched the Rythu Bandhu  Programme, it has triggered a chain reaction amongst States to announce similar or  improved versions of financial aids.   Odisha has launched an economic package.   Instead of waiver, Odisha has announced a package of Rs.180 crore for three years.     Now the Union Government has announced Rs.6000 per year to a family having  up to two hectares of cultivable land.  No doubt, it is a welcome step.  But this  direct income support cannot be a permanent solution.  The actual solution lies in  fixing the Minimum Support Price.  I regret to mention that there is no mention of  revisiting the determination of MSP.    Gujarat and Maharashtra have low  concentration of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe population, while UP and  the eastern coastal States like Odisha have high concentration which need 90 per  cent support in education and other Centrally sponsored schemes.      The disease  will not come and ask you whether you have a BPL card or not.  That is what  Ayushman Bharat always asks for.  But our programme in Odisha covers all  families.  Odisha has its own Swasthya Kalyan Yojana.  Normally, the President's  Address which has actually been prepared by the Government deals with only one  year-since last budget till the new budget is placed.  Here, it covers the whole five  years.    The hon. President has reminded us about the 150th Anniversary of the  birth of Mahatma Gandhi.   It is also the centenary of Visva Bharati.  I do not know  why it did not find a mention in the Address of the hon. President.   Changing a  Government from one to another will not actually help this country to a greater  effect, if we do not stand what liberation is.  The first is the liberation of our public  like fear.  Fear can paralyse dissent, immobilize free speech, free association.  In  the eighth decade of our Independence, India ought to be afraid of nothing, safe its  conscience. The nation is  celebrating 150th golden jubilee anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.  However, a day  before, a leader of Hindu Mahasabha in Eastern Uttar Pradesh shot at the statute  and the photograph of Mahatma Gandhi.  We all should condemn it.  Had this  Government issued any statement regarding desecration of photograph of Mahatma  Gandhi then everyone would have felt that Mahatma Gandhi is their ideal.  In the  country all the ordnance factories are being closed down which could have been  the tools of building a new India.  I fail to understand as to how we are talking  about 'Make in India'.  The Government has shut down the TV channel in the entire  rural area which covered the rural areas and talked about the farmers.  Popular TV  channels do not talk about the rural areas.  I demand that the Government TV  channel should be restarted.   Where will the artists of rural areas find work if this  TV channel is shut down?   We should make efforts to see that the Government  projects are continued and provide job opportunities.  TV centres are being closed  everywhere and their employees have been rendered unemployed.  We want that  the Government should build Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.  This is our feeling.   The  people of Vidarbha gave complete support to the BJP but a separate Vidarbha State  is not being formed.       The development of Vidarbha has got stuck.  There was a  BHEL factory.  Had Vidarbha came into existence, this factory could have been  revived.  We had talked about reservation for women.  But this Government has  done nothing in this regard.  Unmanned level crossings had been discontinued but  the places where underground crossings should have been made remain  waterlogged and the people on both sides remain disconnected.  We want progress  for the farmers and good roads for them.  On the behalf of my party, I oppose the  President's Address. The President's Address was  deeply disappointing which made claims that are contrary to the ground realities  and known facts.  The Government has committed to doubling of farmers' income  by 2022, but there has been decrease in income of farmers due to record food  production and lack of structural reforms in agriculture sector.  The farmers of  Uttar Pradesh are facing problem of non-payment of arrears of sugarcane.  The  employment of 2 crores every year, as promised, has not been created.  The  assessment by the National Sample Survey conducted between July 2017-June  2018, showed the unemployment rate stood at 6.1 per cent, the highest since 45  years.  Moreover, there has been growing incidents of atrocities/discrimination and  violence against the minority communities in the country.  Defence gets mere  1.58% of GDP which is the lowest allocation since 1962.  Thus, the Government  has failed miserably in keeping its promises made in the 2014 election manifesto. The Government has been saying so  many things during the last five years and their achievements are not up to the  expectations.  Some of the Government's actions have resulted in dismantling the  credible institutions.  This is a great injustice to the democracy and to the future  generations.  The hon. President's Speech contains references to 'Demonetisation'.   Many people have lost jobs and many sectors have still not recovered from the  effects of demonetisation.  Similarly, I also support that the Defence forces should  be equipped with the latest technology and weaponry to meet any eventuality.  But  transparency is required in defence purchases.  So, I request this Government to  appoint Joint Parliamentary Committee so that any misgivings on the Rafale deal  can be cleared.  Another issue of serious concern is the intolerance displayed by  the ruling Party.  This approach is not forward looking and will lead to internal  conflicts and unrest in the society.  Similarly, I request this Government to  establish and develop structures which will reduce the interface of the people with  the officials which may aid in reducing the corruption.  As a woman  parliamentarian, I am concerned about the steps undertaken for the development of  women.  Construction of toilets will be a big morale booster apart from being a  health initiative especially to rural woman.  The Government should also quickly  bring in the legislation for providing reservation to women in democratic  institutions.  Apart from that, Government should endeavour to do a lot for the  farmers.  So, I request this Government to provide minimum support price for  tomatoes and onions and also to formulate a scheme for the development of storage  facilities.  When it comes to the handloom sector, it is time to provide substantial  relief to the weaving community by designing appropriate schemes and also to  bring handloom products under zero per cent GST.  I would also request this  Government to design a special package for Rayalaseema and implement the same  in a time bound programme.  I am extremely disappointed at the absence of any  mention on Andhra Pradesh in the President's Address.  Granting of special status  will aid and boost the progress of the newly created State of Andhra Pradesh. The President's Address has not made any  mention about compulsory education.  The Government hospitals do not have  necessary medical equipment like X-Ray machines, facilities for ultra sound and  city scan etc.   The Government should make sports a compulsory subject in the  schools and all those who stand first to fifth grade should be given either  employment or Rs.20 lakhs.  India has never seen unemployment on this scale.   The Government has announced to provide Rs.500 per month to the farmers but it  is a very paltry amount and it is an to insult to the farmer.  The Government has  done nothing for the share croppers, daily wage labourers and bonded labourers.   The Government gives Bharat Ratna to the politicians but I would like to know as  to why the Bharat Ratna has not been given to the persons like Periyar, Mahatma  Phule, Kabir, Bhagat Singh etc?  So far as Open Defecation Free (ODF) Scheme is  concerned, I would like to tell that  the toilets provided in the villages under the  scheme do not have even doors.  In Bihar, just 5 persons have benefitted under the  Ujjawala Scheme during the last one year.  The Government should celebrate the  national days like 26th January and 15th August  as festivals.  People's money   should not be spent for this purpose.  These festivals need not be celebrated every  year.  I oppose the manner in  which this Amendment Bill has been introduced.  The barrier of 50 per cent fixed  by Hon'ble Supreme Court has been broken.  We want 85 per cent reservation for  SC, ST, OBC and most backward castes, you may take 10 per cent.   Those who  are Muslims, Christians and Dalits and are out of mainstream, their interests should  be ensured, and those should be included in it.  There should be a survey to find  out the persons who are landless, shelterless and deprived of education and jobs  and ensure reservation on this basis.  This is a trap being placed for elections. I oppose this Bill because this Bill is a  fraud on the Constitution.  This Bill is an insult to Baba Saheb Ambedkar because  the original purpose of the reservation was to give social justice, to reduce social  and educational backwardness.  The Constitution does not recognize economically  weaker section at all, it is against the spirit of the Constitution.  May I know from  the Government whether the Savarnas ever faced untouchability, oppression,  discrimination?  This exercise is fraught with impropriety since there is no  evidence of empirical data which can show backwardness of these Savarna people.   Empirical evidence is found in the reports of the Sachar Committee, Mishra  Commission, Kundu Committee.  In 2011 census, lowest literacy rate was of  Muslims; lowest number of people in schools was of Muslims; highest drop-out  rate was of Muslims; and lowest number of people in graduate was of Muslims.   My State Telangana has passed an Act asking for 10 per cent reservation for the  Muslims and 12 per cent for STs backed by empirical evidence.  You have not  approved it for the last six months.  If you are so serious about 'sabka saath, sabka  vikaas', then what about the 1950 Presidential Order.  Is that not a violation of right  to equality?  You cannot pass this Bill in the courts of law.  This will be struck  down. This bill is an election stunt. We also want  the weaker section of the society to be empowered. If BJP cared so much about the  poor, this bill would have been introduced on the first day of the first session. They  have introduced it on the last day of the last session. I had a talk with some people  in the RSS, they said that they actually want to enter into this. Once the  Constitution is amended, they would gradually reduce the reservation of the SC,  ST Act. I belong to the Jat-Sikh community; our condition is also not good. If they  were really concerned, then this bill would have been introduced earlier. They just  want to make an issue. Undoubtedly, I support the policy  and theory contained in the Bill.  The purport with which the Government has  brought in this Bill does not attract our full faith though.  It is true that the  Government is implementing what essentially figured in the Congress Manifesto.   The fact of the matter is that the level of unemployment has reached its peak vis-a- vis the ones recorded over the last 70 years.  Before I conclude, I can't help saying  that in 19A, contained in the Directions by the Speaker, there is a clear mention  that in case of any amendment to the Constitution a notice to this effect must be  circulated at least two days ahead of its being introduced.  The instant development  speaks volumes of the underlying pattern of the Government as just a day before,  there has been a Cabinet decision and today on the last day, the Bill has been  moved at the eleventh hour.  The point I wish to drive home is - had the  Government been committed to this cause, they would  have come up with the Bill  earlier.  We have reasons to doubt the commitment of the Government.  In theory,  the Bill is appropriate but the underlying  motto should also essentially be fair. We should appreciate  this Government for introducing this Bill in the fag end of their tenure.  If they  were so keen on social justice, they should have brought this Bill much earlier.  As  there were inequalities in the society, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar had made provisions in  the Constitution for SCs, STs and OBCs.  Article 340 provides for the  classification of OBCs and Article 341 provides for the classification of SCs.  Article 342 provides for classification of STs. Where is the provision for  classification of the economically weaker sections?  Unless it is made, this Bill will  not stand scrutiny of the judiciary.  Finally, I would appeal to the Government that  if they are so keen, let them bring an amendment to safeguard the interest of  Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in promotional aspects.   I oppose this Bill because a marriage is a  contract in Islam.  It is a contract which is being signed between a husband and a  wife.  If a wife does not know that her husband is having an ailment, that in itself is  null and void.  Government is taking away the right of a woman to divorce a man  who is concealing his disease.  Leprosy is a ground for divorce in other islamic  countries.  Why is it that Government has not looked what is happening in other  islamic countries.  Leprosy should be eradicated but the Government is not  spending money.  That is why I feel that the Government is doing it selectively.   So, I request the Government to please do not interfere in the Muslim Personal  Law. Today we are discussing the  issue of Rafale fighter jet deal in the House.  In the first place, I would like to urge  upon the government not to ignore the truth and let the constitution of JPC be in  place. The nation needs loaf, clothing and shelter. Shri Arun Jaitley ji has referred to  the judgment of the Supreme Court again and again but we have already expressed  the opinion that the Supreme Court will not investigate such matter and the JPC is  the only instrument available to find solution to this issue.  The Supreme Court has  not given any clean chit.  It has just said that the material placed before it shows  that the Government has not disclosed the pricing details even to the Parliament on  the grounds that sensitivity of pricing details could affect the national security  apart from breaching the agreement between the two countries.  The pricing details  have, however, been shared with the Comptroller and Auditor General and the  Report of C&AG has been examined by the Public Accounts Committee.  I would  like to ask as to when the CAG report has been tabled on the floor of the House?   How the report can be tabled without the Speaker taking note of that?  Who is  responsible for this?  The Supreme Court has been misguided.  In December, 2012  the price of the Rafale aircraft was Rs. 526 crore and in November, 2016 the  Government informed that the price is Rs. 670 crore.  Then in the year 2017 the  price was pegged at Rs. 1670 crore.  Then the Government took a u-turn and  argued that this is an inter-governmental agreement and the price of the aircraft  cannot be disclosed because of the secrecy clause.  But this secrecy clause  prevailed earlier also when the price was disclosed.  We would like to know as to  why the advance and performance bank guarantee and sovereign guarantee were  waived in this case.  The Reliance has itself admitted that they have got the  contract worth Rs. 1,30,000 crore.  It is this reason that we are insisting that this is  a scam involving Rs. 1,30,000 crore.  It is a big scam and a JPC should be  constituted to investigate it. The price of the Rafale aircraft was inflated  from Rs. 526 crore to Rs. 1600 crore.  The Government should tell the nation as to  who were the persons accompanying the Prime Minister when he visited France.   Whether the Defence Minister and the Defence Secretary went to France along  with him.  I, therefore, demand that a JPC should be constituted. It appears that the Congress Party now has  no concern for the unemployed, for dalits and the likes.  They are only concerned  about the Rafale deal. The Hon. Defence Minister has released an RFQ.  An issue  has also been raised as to why only 36 Rafale aircraft are to be procured in place of  126.  Assuming, if our Government signs a deal with one company for  procurement of all 126 aircraft and some issues relating to spare parts crop up with  that company or our relations with that country get soured, then in that case what is  the best option for us.  If the Government procure two squadrons each from  separate companies, then it will be beneficial for us.  But the Congress people are  not able to understand it.  I would like to tell you as to why the entire Congress  party is so agitated about the Rafale deal.  In fact, dealers of all major international  defence companies have a link with the Congress party.  They are fighting for their  share of commission.  The Congress party has always compromised with the  security of the country. The Supreme Court of India in its landmark  judgment known as the Aadhaar Judgment case restricted the Government's ability  to link everything they like to Aadhaar.  This Bill enables the Government to  facilitate the enactment of laws to provide for mandatory Aadhaar-based  authentication for the provision of \\\"any service\\\" which can therefore also include  private services.  Second reason is that the Bill is premature, because we first need  the enactment of a Data Protection Law to prescribe the basic standards to protect  our right to privacy.    The Bill uses the terms 'identification' and 'authentication'  synonymously, thereby blurring this important distinction.  Due to these reasons, I  urge the Minister to withdraw this Bill and bring a revised list of amendments to  the Aadhaar Act after we enact a data protection framework. The price of each aircraft was increased by  47.7 per cent.  The benchmark price had to be corrected before and then  negotiations should have been carried out, but the Hon. Prime Minister made a  declaration prior to correction of benchmark price and then the Government gave a  false statement in the Supreme Court.  Our Air Vice Chief had said that the  benchmark price should have been 5.2 billion euros but it was increased by 3.2  billion euros for each aircraft.  How was this increased?  They did not pay heed to  the expert committee.  All the objections were not addressed by the committee  under the then Minister of Defence.  Then the matter went to the Prime Minister  led committee, CCS, which overruled all those objections and fixed the price.  That  is why the Prime Minister\\u2019s name is being taken and he will have to face it because  there is his involvement at every step in this case.  Therefore, there is a charge of  corruption in this matter.  Could we not do the research in our own country in the  name of which we are paying three billion euros more for each aircraft?  We could  have increased our capability.  The company which could not even run Airport  Metro in Delhi, we are asking it to manufacture aircraft in collaboration with  Dassault.  I think this discussion could be carried out in a better way if the demand  for JPC is agreed to.\",\n          \"We are fortunate that we were born in India and  that Ayodhya is located in India. We deem ourselves to be lucky enough to belong  to the tradition of chanting Rama\\u2019s name. If one wishes to know Ram, harbouring  love and compassion is a prerequisite for it. He is unintelligible and beyond  comprehension if one is deficient in these two jewels. Prayers for the fulfilment of  wishes and inherent desires of the people have been granted by Him. The day of  22nd January ensued at the altar of innumerable lives dedicated to this cause that  enabled us to breathe a sigh of relief today. Lord Rama is the embodiment of love  and humanity. If one is inquisitive to know Lord Ram and be familiar to Him, one  will have to first espouse the essence of equality. The Socialism that we fondly refer  to quite often is attributed to Lord Rama. Today we talk big but one must not consign  it to oblivion that Lord Ram is such an entity that made sacrifices.  India also needs  Lord Rama at this time. Let\\u2019s take this nation to be Rama and act like Hanuman. Our  illustrious, vigorous and sage-like Prime Minister had fair and sacrosanct intentions,  he had reverence for Lord Rama, which is why the most important role of carrying  out of PranPratishtha was bequeathed to Him by the Almighty. If one really wishes  to be an ideal son, brother and good human being and have to even emerge as an  administrator steering the vehicle of good governance, one will have to adopt the  philosophy and the patterns of His conduct in life. I would like to congratulate  our 140 crore Indians on  the Pran Pratishtha of Shri Ramlala in Ayodhya. Lord Ram  has been a part of our country\\u2019s identity for thousands of years. Lord Ram is  omnipresent from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Somnath to Pasighat. He is  celebrated not only in our country but also across various other countries like  Indonesia, Myanmar, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, etc. We remember Lord Ram in joy  as well as in sadness. Even before I knew anything about politics, I knew about the  virtues of Lord Ram and Ramayana. At the end of his great epic journey during his  vanvas for 14 years, he brought the integration of North and South India. We the  Telugu people of Andhra Pradesh have a very close association with the journey of  Lord Shri Ram, especially with places like Bhadrachalam, which is also called as  Dakshin Ayodhya.  He showcased such qualities that people across religions and  civilisations have a deep respect for him. His ideals and morals on governance which  we dearly called  \\u2018Ramrajya\\u2019 have long been considered to be the pinnacle of how a  Government must work. When Lord Ram decided to go to Lanka to protect Maa Sita  from the clutches of Ravana, his army did not consist  only of  one group. He chose  to work collectively with Lord Hanuman to Jatayu and from Laxshman to  Vibhishan.  Even a small animal like a squirrel came in support of Lord Ram. They  were all with him not merely because he was God but because he inspired them to  come together and achieve collective greatness. Similarly, Ram Rajya speaks about  the necessity of all parts of society working collectively together. A society cannot  grow if there is no collective growth.  Actually, Lord Ram is prevalent across all  sections and religions of our country. His ideals are relevant from education to  foreign policy and from governance to communal harmony. This is the only  Parliament where we have got the good fortune of honouring Lord Ramchandra ji  upon his arrival in Ayodhya. Today is an auspicious day when we all are progressing  ahead through democratic ways. Two temples have been inaugurated viz. the temple  of Lord Shri Ramchandra ji has been inaugurated at Ram Janmabhoomi and the  biggest temple of democracy has also been inaugurated. The members who are  present in this House are witness to the historic moment. Nepotism was mentioned  in the House. One who progresses ahead through his own hard work should not be  termed as resorting to nepotism. A king's son will not become a king; only the  deserving person will become king. I thank the voters of the Nagina Parliamentary  Constituency in Uttar Pradesh for giving me the opportunity to work for this temple  of democracy. I also thank the dynamic Prime Minister of this country, who has  taken this country forward by taking several good steps for the welfare of the  country. I would also like to thank Hon. Speaker Sir for giving me the opportunity  to raise the problems and development issues related to the people of my  Constituency. Hon. Speaker Sir and the experienced  Members of this House never allowed the new Members here to feel that we have  been elected to the Lok Sabha for the first time. We were given a fair opportunity to  raise issues pertaining to our constituency. We learnt a lot from the senior Members  here. If the people of my Parliamentary Constituency Amravati continue to bless me,  I will be able to serve them again in the coming time. I take this opportunity to thank the  Hon. Speaker, the Treasury Benches and the entire Opposition. I don't even know  how these five years went by. It seems as if the results came only yesterday.   Everyone suffered a loss of two years due to COVID-19. The way you and your  entire office worked is commendable. There were many disagreements during these  five years, but the relationship remained intact. This batch of ours will be a batch  which has worked in both old and new buildings.  The place of development this  country has reached in 70 years is due to everyone's hard work. I am deeply grateful  to all of you for supporting us all. I am very grateful to all the people of my  constituency. I cannot express my gratitude to the party right now, because the party  is in a bit of a dilemma. When we come next time, you all should stay together.  Political fights will continue, but there should never be differences and bitterness in  our relations, this is the best thing about democracy.                                                         I salute Hon. Prime Minister for conferring  'Bharat Ratna' on farmer leader Chaudhary Charan Singh ji and Shri M.S.  Swaminathan, who made the country self-reliant in the agriculture sector. Many thanks to the Hon. Speaker S for giving ample  opportunity to all Members here to express their views during the 17th Lok Sabha.  The Treasury Benches also deserve thanks for providing proper facilities to all the  Members of Parliament.  The way Hon. Speaker Sir has conducted  the proceedings in this House, especially during the Covid period, is commendable.  Everyone will remember him in the future because of his good behaviour. The coming to the close of the  current Winter Session of the Seventeenth Lok Sabha, marks yet an eventful  milestone in our Parliamentary history. The current Lok Sabha too has had its share  of tumultuous and also epoch-making events. We have witnessed the inauguration,  opening and shifting of our Parliamentary business to the new Parliament House.  We have commenced the journey of our Parliament from this new Parliament House  from 19th September 2023 onwards. I would like to recall the first Session of the  current Lok Sabha when Shri Om Birla was elected as the Speaker, Lok Sabha. Right  from the day of assuming Office, Shri Birla has been steadfastly taking and is  continuing to take a number of initiatives for smoothening and improving the  Parliamentary practices and processes and providing better amenities to the hon.  Members be it accommodation, medical facilities, transport, or appropriate support  mechanism for discharging one\\u2019s Parliamentary duties. Being the Chairperson of the  Public Accounts Committee, I am particularly grateful to the Speaker for his  leadership and guidance in holding the centennial celebrations of the PAC on a grand  scale in December, 2021.  The event was truly epoch-making in the history of the  Indian Parliament and its Committees. While we have discussed, debated and voted  upon a number of matters of public importance, we have also had a fair share of  adjournments and loss of business time of the House. This is a part and parcel of our  democratic process. Debate and discussion are the hallmarks of our Parliamentary  system. Despite the pulls and pressures of the times, the hon. The speaker has always  maintained his composure and tried to accommodate all sections of the House in  expressing their viewpoints and conducted the proceedings of the House with  diligence and dignity. The Opposition in the House played its role responsibly in  raising and debating on issues of immense public interest and concern that included  the fallout of the COVID pandemic on the common people, the threat posed to our  nation\\u2019s security, problems posed by pollution, rising levels of unemployment and  the effect of increasing inflationary pressures on the lives of common people. In the  previous Session, we witnessed an unfortunate incident of security breach in the  Parliament House which obviously is not a good sign and does not augur well. I am  sure that we will not be witnessing such incidents or face any form of security threat  in future. In statistical terms, the 17th Lok Sabha has been very productive with a  very significant number of legislations passed, questions posed, matters of public  importance raised during the Zero Hour and under Rule 377 and discussions held on  matters of public importance. As a responsible Opposition, we have always  endeavoured to strengthen our parliamentary system of governance and will  continue to do so. My Party has always stood and fought for preserving, protecting  and upholding our hard-earned freedom and democratic rights and we always  continue to do so. I would like to place on record my appreciation for the immense  amount of hard work and labour that the Secretariat staff, who work under the  administrative control of the Secretary-General have put and ensured that the  sessions of the House were held with precision and perfection. As the Leader of the  largest Opposition Party in the House, I would take this opportunity to express my  thanks and gratitude to the hon. Speaker for his help and support.  The Water Prevention and Control of  Pollution Act suffers from various drawbacks. It is silent about the groundwater  management policies and fails to deal with the indiscriminate tapping of groundwater.  Therefore, this Amendment Bill is very relevant. The court has observed that the right  to clean water is a part of the basic necessity of the human right to life and the State is  duty-bound to prevent water from getting polluted. In 2021, the Parliamentary Panel  recommended the Department to focus its attention on the rural habitations. I welcome  the provision of the Bill on behalf of my Party, Biju Janta Dal. We should be  proactive so far as protecting our water bodies is concerned. There is an urgent need to  prevent our streams, reservoirs, rivers, and lakes from being polluted. If the systemic  weaknesses associated with the governance structure are not addressed, there is not  going to be any benefit from any amendments. India needs a robust monitoring and  enforcement system that can detect and arrest pollution at the source. The Government  must ensure strong, transparent and accountable mechanisms that strengthen the  policy and achieve its objectives. First of all, I would like to express a debt of  gratitude to the Hon. Prime Minister for conferring Bharat Ratna on our Jan Nayak  Karpuri Thakur ji this year. It is a tribute for all the people of Bihar to their respected  leader. This makes 14 crore people of Bihar proud. This Budget is not a populist one  but has paved the way to strengthen the economy of the country, which has taken  special care of farmers, youth, the poor and women. We hope that in the year 2024,  when NDA's government is formed with an overwhelming majority, many important  and historic decisions will be taken in the interest of the countrymen in the full Budget  of July. It will achieve the goal of making India a developed Country by the year  2047. Hon. Minister of Finance in her Budget Speech has emphasised that east and  North-East India will be made the growth engines of the country. Maize and Makhana  are mostly grown in the Seemanchal region of Bihar. Our demand is that when the  full-time Budget is presented, initiatives should be taken to set up Maize and  Makhana-based industries in Seemanchal so that our biggest problem of human  resource migration can be tackled. Hon. Finance Minister has announced the  manufacturing of 40,000 Vande Bharat coaches. This is a good thing. I request the  Hon. Railway Minister to kindly ensure that the fare of Vande Bharat remains  affordable to the middle class. There is a mention of the upgradation of the railways in  the Interim Budget. My constituency Purnia is divided into two parts in the case of  railways. It is divided into the Northeast Frontier Railway and East Central Railway.  This is the reason why Purnia is not getting the kind of railway facilities that it  actually deserves.  Two railway projects in our region are pending. We have been  making a demand to this effect for a long time. Therefore, we demand from the  Government that both of the projects should be made operational. There is a four-lane  National Road, Vidupur-Dalsingh Sarai, Simri Bakhtiyarpur-Purnia Green Field  Access Road, which is likely to be sanctioned soon; this may also be sanctioned and  constructed. Purnia-Khagaria road, which is now called Super Express, should be  converted into four lanes and provision should be made in the Budget for the same.  The work of level crossing number 91 connecting Siswan to Siwan City is pending, it  may also be completed through the Hon. Railway Minister. There is no train from  Purnia to Patna. So please introduce a train there. I conclude by supporting the Budget  introduced by the Finance Minister. Hon\\u2019ble Prime Minister of the country stepped  forward with the resolution of developed India. The four pillars on which developed  India will depend are \\u2013 the poor, women, youth and farmers. Through Jan Dhan,  Aadhaar and Mobile, we have worked to provide Rs 34 lakh crore to the farmers and  the common man through Direct Benefit Transfer in the past years. In my Lok Sabha  constituency, there was work to provide drinking water to 3 lakh 8 thousand  households. Under the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Jyoti Yojana, it was the  dream of Prime Minister Ji that by the year 2022, we will work to illuminate the last  person living in Dhani. Under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana claim  disbursement worth Rs 7200 crore has been done in Churu Lok Sabha constituency in  the last 6 years. Very good work has been done in the railway sector. The work to lay  a new line to connect a very important railway line Sardar Shahar to Hanumangarh  and Taranagar-Sardarshahar should be done. It is a good Budget. Some work has been done  in every area in this budget. Sanctions have been given to open a bank in a village in a  region in my constituency. In the ten years of this Government, all the work has been  completed. I will request that the stalled railway projects worth Rs 50,000 crore  should be passed at the earliest. No work is being done for the Bishnupur-Tarakeswar  line. Kendriya Vidyalaya has also been approved in my area, but as land is not  sanctioned, its work has stopped. Our West Bengal is going backwards. In my state,  people who work in the state government are not getting DA. Our successful students  are not getting jobs. I support and welcome the  Interim Budget for the year 2024-25.  This budget has an allocation of  Rs. 1 lakh  crore for promoting new research and innovation and sufficient allocation has been  made for tax rebates and capital expenditure for start-ups.  The target of 2 crore  additional dwelling units in the next 5 years under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana  has been set and all the Asha Workers, Aanganwadi workers and helpers are included  in the Ayushman Bharat Scheme. In view of promoting tourism, there is a scheme to  offer long-term loans to the states at zero interest rates.  The expansion of tourism  infrastructure and facilities will be done on all the islands including Lakshadweep.  In  the last 10 years, tax collection increased ten times and the number of those filing  income tax returns has gone up by two and half times.  To protect the environment  and to achieve zero carbon emission by the year 2070, a target of installing solar  panels on the rooftops of one crore houses has been set.  New schemes will be  introduced for biomanufacturing and bio-foundry.  The Budget 2024 lays special emphasis on the  upliftment of women, youth, farmers and the poor. The Interim Budget 2024 has  provided Rs 502 crore for the UDAN scheme to revive 22 airports. Grant should also  be provided to Sabeya Airport located in my Parliamentary Constituency Gopalganj  so that air service can start from there as soon as possible. If there is more allocation  for 7 Nischay, Part-2 Scheme of Bihar in the budget, then the pace of development  will increase. Capital expenditure has been increased to Rs 11 lakh 11 thousand 111  crore in this Budget by keeping the fiscal deficit under control, which will develop  infrastructure in the country and provide countless employment opportunities. This  budget has encouraged the use of Nano DAP, a scheme for animals, expansion of the  fisheries scheme which will benefit farmers immensely. The allocation has been made  to develop several important corridors for Railways. I suggest that the budget should  be allocated to develop heavy traffic corridors like Thawe. In the interim budget for the year 2024-25,  while making the welfare of every Indian meaningful, works have been undertaken on  the four strong pillars, by encompassing Sabka Saath, and Sabka Vikas. Those four  pillars are - youth power, women power, farmers and the poor. The Government,  while imitating welfare measures for these four classes, has provided Rs. 30 crore  Mudra loans to the women, increased the enrollment of women in higher education by  28 percent and provided ownership rights to 70 percent of women in PM Awas  Yojana. The Government has formulated a scheme to vaccinate girls between the ages  of 9 and 14 years for Cervical Cancer and has initiated measures to cover ASHA  workers, Anganwadi workers and other workers under the Ayushman Bharat scheme.  10 crore Ujjwala gas connections were provided to the people and 11 crore rural  households were connected through Nal Jal Yojana. Toilets were constructed in 11  crore houses and free ration was provided to 81 crore people. 40 thousand railway  tracks were laid, wherein, both the districts of Bhind Lok Sabha Constituency - Bhind  and Datia railway stations were incorporated under the AMRUT scheme. Four ROBs  of the railway have been constructed at Ater Bridge, Gohad, Mehgaon Soni, Barahet,  and Monera. Maa Pitambaramai Dham has been connected under the UDAN scheme  for the construction of the airport. The construction of six-lane/four-lane roads for the  Bhind, Gwalior, and Etawah route has been approved. The setting up of a medical  college in Bhind has also been sanctioned. The Nari Shakti Vandan Act has been  enacted to provide for 33 percent reservation to women in the Parliament and  Legislative Assemblies in the coming time. The Government under the leadership of  Hon. Modi ji is working with the motto of the welfare of all. The people of the  country have full faith in the Hon. Prime Minister. The Government, under the leadership of  Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji has made India such a big economic, technological  and military power in the last 10 years, that, today, no single country in the whole  world can compete with India on these three fronts. This budget is the foundation  stone to make India a developed nation by the year 2047. It will further empower the  four pillars of a developed India i.e. youth, poor, women and farmers. The  achievement of setting up 3000 new ITIs demonstrates the farsighted vision of the  Government. The introduction of the nano category of fertilizers and the incorporation  of modern technologies will help the farmers and rural areas of the country to harness  their full potential. The focus of tourists from all over the world has turned to India  after the visits of the Hon'ble Prime Minister to Lakshadweep and the Pink City,  Jaipur. It has been decided to provide long-term interest-free loans to the States for the  all-round development of famous tourism destinations. Railways has been allocated a  budget of Rs 02.56 lakh crore. Primarily, three new Railway Corridors will be  constructed and the number of modern trains like Namo Bharat and Metro trains will  be increased. Along with that, 40,000 general coaches will be converted into Vande  Bharat coaches. One crore families will be able to get free electricity up to 300 units  every month through rooftop solarization under the Pradhan Mantri Suryodaya  Yojana. I would like to request that the work of revival of the Ramgarh and Kalakh  dams be completed at the earliest by including it in the first phase of the E.R.C.P.  project.    I welcome this interim budget as an all- inclusive and public-welfare Union Budget. This budget will fulfil the dreams of  every section of the people. This budget will also be capable of fulfilling the dreams  of the aspirational society including the poor, middle class, farmers and women.  Keeping in mind the economic-social upliftment of the tribal community in the  country, the Tribal Justice Mahabhiyan (PM Janman) scheme has been launched.  Special schemes have been launched to encourage tribal arts, handicrafts and food  products. The government has launched the Pradhan Mantri Tribal Vikas Mission for  the development of tribal communities. The government has launched many schemes  for the welfare of tribals. More than 10 crore houses have benefited through the  Ujjwala scheme. Provision for Vande Bharat train has been made in this budget. Three  major railway corridors have been proposed under Gati Shakti. Under the PM Jan  Dhan Yojana, so far in the country accounts of more than 50 crore poor people have  been opened. Many welfare schemes like PM Mudra Yojana, PM Awas Yojana, PM  Kisan Samman Yojana, PM Swanidhi Yojana, free ration to 80 crore people and  rooftop solarization scheme and free electricity rooftop solarization scheme under  which free electricity up to 300 units will be given every month to every house have  been started. Promotion of Nano Urea, development of infrastructure, promotion of  cervical cancer vaccination, and extension of Ayushman Bharat to all ASHAs,  Anganwadi workers and Sahaika are important decisions of the Government. For the  development of women and their dignity, more political representation of women has  been ensured by passing the Women's Reservation Bill. Under PM-Kisan Samman  Yojana, every year 11.8 crore farmers are provided assistance through DBT. Under  the Skill India Mission, 1.4 crore youth have been trained and 3000 new ITIs have  been established. This interim budget is going to take the country forward. The basic Mantra of the  Government is to work with \\\"Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas aur Sabka Vishwas\\\" which  will lead to the all-round development of all people and all regions. The Government  has focused on 'poor', 'women', 'youth' and 'farmers' to make India a developed  country by 2047. Under the PM Kisan Samman Yojana, direct financial assistance  was provided to 11.8 crore farmers including marginal and small farmers every year.  1361 Mandis have been integrated through the electronic National Agriculture  Market. Assistance is also being provided to link farmers with the food processing  industry. The trend of Nano DAP with Nano urea instead of granular fertilizers is also  being increased. 55 lakh employment opportunities in future under PM Matsya  Sampada Yojana will be created. Various development schemes are being run for the  promotion of women's empowerment. Vaccination for girls in the age group of 9 to 14  years will be started to protect against cervical cancer. Schemes like \\u201cSaksham  Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0\\\" are being implemented for the health care and  development of mothers and sisters. Poverty alleviation of people under Garib Kalyan,  Desh Kalyan is being done. Direct benefit transfers of Rs. 34 lakh crore have been  made through PM Jan Dhan Accounts. PM SVANidhi extends loan assistance to 78  lakh street vendors. PM Vishwakarma Yojana is meant to help artisans and craftsmen  engaged in 18 works. Provisions of free ration for 80 crore people have been made.  Keeping in mind the empowerment of the youth of Amrit Peedhi, 1.4 crore youth were  trained under the Skill India Mission. The cost of capital expenditure has increased  three times during the last 4 years and the budget has been increased by 11%. The  number of airports in the aviation sector has doubled in the last ten years. The defence  budget outlay has been increased by 27000 crore rupees. In the historic proud moment  of 22 January 2024, the \\u201cPraan Pratishtha\\u201d of Shri Ram temple was done in Ayodhya.  Under the \\\"Suryodaya Yojana\\\", rooftop solarisation was introduced which will  provide free electricity to 1 crore households up to 300 units every month. The government, through this interim budget, has  tried to lay a strong foundation for the future by increasing the infrastructure  expenditure by 11 percent in the coming financial year. The government will launch  the 'Housing for Middle Class' scheme for the middle class which is close to achieving  the target of 3 crore houses. Cervical cancer vaccination will be promoted for girls  aged 9-14 years. Health coverage will be expanded under the Ayushman Bharat  scheme. The government has decided to withdraw the disputed outstanding tax  demand up to Rs 25,000 for FY 2010 and Rs 10,000 for FY 2011 to 2015, which will  benefit one crore taxpayers. The government will enable one crore households to  install solar rooftop panels. Anganwadis and Poshan 2.0 will be fast-tracked for better  nutrition and child care and development. The government also aims to expand and  comprehensively develop existing airports under the UDAN scheme. The Central  Government will implement three major railway corridor programs under PM Gati  Shakti to increase logistics efficiency and reduce costs. Overall, this budget is  dedicated to the welfare and empowerment of youth, farmers, poor and women. Some of the highlights of this  interim Budget presented by Shrimati Nirmala Sitharaman include a positive change  in the Indian Economy. This interim Budget gives a push to the agenda of India  becoming a developed nation by 2047.  The Budget lays stress on sustainable  economic development and fiscal consolidation. The Government has achieved the  target of fiscal consolidation despite the challenges it had inherited in legacy by taking  proactive measures like incremental addition on capital expenditure, which have  resulted in an anticipated decrease of fiscal consolidation upto 5.1 per cent which is  likely to further go down upto 4.5 per cent in 2025-26.  This Budget also emphasised  Capital Expenditure led Development. The allocation for major projects for the year  2024-25 has been increased up to Rs. 11,11,111 crore which is 3.4 per cent of this  year\\u2019s budget which is a fourfold increase over the 2013-14 allocation for capital  expenditure.  The Budget prepares the ground for Infrastructure Development. This  Budget envisages a large-scale increase in the infrastructure development in the  country.  The Budget also envisage realizing the dream of \\u2018Amrit Kal\\u2019 by providing  social justice which includes various welfare measures for the upliftment of the poor  and receipt of lakhs of crores of rupees to them as Direct Benefit Transfer.  The  Budget also focuses on women's empowerment which includes measures like their  social autonomy, financial inclusion and broader political representation. The Budget  also focuses on the all-inclusive development and welfare of the farmers by various  schemes like Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana etc.  This Budget is also a  work in progress towards realizing the Panchamrit targets of the Government. This budget has taken special  care of villages, the poor, farmers, the middle class, women, the elderly, youth and the  underprivileged. The poor, youth, women and farmers are at the centre of the  government's schemes. In the budget, many announcements were made for all sectors  including agriculture, health, defence, railways and infrastructure. The government  will bring a housing scheme for the middle class and 2 crore houses will be built in the  next 5 years. About 1 crore women became Lakhpati Didi, which is now targeted to  become 3 crore Lakhpati Didi. In the field of education, 390 universities have been set  up. It has been stated in the new budget that interest-free loans will be provided to  tech-savvy youth for 50 years. The new scheme will be launched to strengthen Deep  Tech Technology for defence purposes and accelerate self-reliance. The government  has allocated Rs 1.37 lakh for the Ministry of Communications. The government has  uplifted 250 million people out of multidimensional poverty in the last 10 years. A  provision of Rs 75,000 crore has been made as a fifty-year interest-free loan. The  number of airports in the country has doubled to 149 airports. Orders for more than  1,000 new aircraft have also been placed. Under the rooftop solarization scheme, 300  units of electricity will be given free of cost every month. A new scheme will be  launched under Blue Economy 2.0. Electric vehicles will be promoted. While  promoting indigenous tourism, the infrastructure of Lakshadweep will be developed.  Railways will convert 40,000 general rail coaches into Vande Bharat-like coaches.  In  the health sector, the focus will be on cervical cancer vaccination, maternal and child  care schemes as well as vaccination of girls in the age group of 9 to 14 years will be  promoted. A Budget allocation of 6.2 lakh crores has been kept for defence. 4 crore  farmers are being given the benefit of PM Fasal Beema Yojna. Financial assistance  was given to 11.8 crore farmers. \\u20b9 34 lakh crore has been deposited in the accounts  under Garib Kalyan Yojana. The budgetary allocation has been increased from 60  thousand crores to 86 thousand crores for MNREGA. 1.4 crore youth have been  trained under the Skill India Mission and 3000 new ITIs have been set up. In the field  of credit, 30 crore Mudra Yojana loans were given to women entrepreneurs under PM  Mudra Yojana. In the last financial year, a total loan of Rs 43 crore was given under  PM Mudra Yojana. Of these, loans worth about Rs 22.5 lakh crore were given to  industries, including schemes like start-ups, funds of funds, etc. This budget is an  inclusive budget.   On behalf of my Shiv Sena Party, I stand  here in support of the Jammu and Kashmir Local Bodies Laws (Amendment) Bill,  2024. Till now the backward classes had not been given representation in the local  bodies of Jammu and Kashmir. Because of our illustrious Prime Minister, today for  the first time after 75 years of independence, justice is going to be delivered to the  Other Backward Classes of Jammu and Kashmir. The longest ruling party at the  centre, the Congress party never worried about OBCs. Not only this, when the BJP  supported the V.P. Singh Government implemented the recommendations of the   Mandal Commission, the Congress people protested strongly both inside and  outside the Parliament. Apart from this, in future, all the local body elections will  be conducted by the Jammu and Kashmir State Election Commission, so that there  will be no interference of the State Government in the elections and there will be  fair elections. Granting constitutional status to the National Backward Classes  Commission is one of the major achievements of the present Government. I urge  the Government that the census of Koli, Dhangar, and Lingayat be conducted  through the recently constituted Backward Classes Commission, if the respective  communities desire so, and on the completion of the enquiry in this regard, if  someone wants to avail the facility of the reservation of SC, ST or OBCs, they  should be allowed to do so as per their eligibility. I support the Bills introduced in the  House. I congratulate the Government for providing 33 per cent reservation to  women. Commission for Backward Classes and Commission for Women should be  set up in that State also. This will definitely benefit people belonging to the OBC  category in that State. The work done by the  Government to do justice to the people of Kashmir by abrogating Article 370 is  appreciated by the people of the State. The people at ground level are happy with  the work being carried out to address the problem of unemployment and promotion  of education in the State. The State of Jammu and Kashmir should also progress  like other parts of the country. The Bill makes a provision for providing  reservation to OBCs in local bodies of Jammu and Kashmir. It is a welcome step.   In future, all elections to the local bodies of Jammu and Kashmir will be held by  the State Election Commission instead of the Chief Election Officer of Jammu and  Kashmir. The neutrality of the Election Commissioner has also been ensured in the  Bill. On behalf of my party Shiv Sena, I  rise to speak in support of The Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means)  Bill, 2024. The Bill aims to prevent unfair practices to bring in greater  transparency, fairness and credibility in the public examination system. At present,  there is no specific concrete law to deal with the offences committed or unfair  means adopted by the various institutions involved in the conduct of public  examinations by the Central Government and its agencies. There was concern in  the country, especially among the youth, about irregularities in examinations. The  incidents of question paper leaks were increasing day by day. The Bill aims to take  action against organised gangs, mafia elements and those indulging in malpractices   without targeting students. It became imperative to take action against the  Government officials found guilty. This will be possible when this Bill becomes  law. There is a provision to constitute a High-Level Technical Committee on  Public Examinations, which will make recommendations to make the  computerized examination process more secure. The committee will develop  protocols for insulating digital platforms, devise ways and means to develop  foolproof IT security systems, ensure electronic monitoring of examination centres  and formulate national standards and services for both IT and physical  infrastructure to be deployed for conducting competitive examinations. The Bill  provides for a jail term of 3 to 10 years and a fine of more than one crore rupees  for malpractices in public examinations. This will reduce malpractices in public  examinations, this is my belief.  The issue of question paper leaks in  the last few years has affected the interests of lakhs of students and candidates. It is  necessary to stop this. The entire thrust of this Bill is to crack down on organised  mafia and institutions engaged in paper leaks and paper solving, impersonation and  hacking of computer resources. In the proposed Bill, action will be taken against  organized crime mafia and those involved in collusion. The bill provides for a jail  term of three to five years and a fine of Rs 10 lakhs for leaking the question paper,  taking the examination in place of someone else, solving questions or helping in it,  conducting the examination at a place other than the examination centre, not  reporting irregularities in the examination. A fine of up to Rs. Ten lakhs has been  decided which is a very commendable work. This law should be publicized among  the public, only then it will have more impact. Apart from this, national standards  will also be prepared for top competitive examinations. This Bill is very important   for our country. The system of viva in exams should be abolished, which is a big  source of corruption. The Public Examinations  (Prevention of Unfair Means) Bill, 2024 is a historic bill. This law was much  needed. Law is needed for those who break the law. Malpractice for the exam has  been going on for a long time. This is not today's thing. I have been watching this  for 25 years. Unless there is excellence in human character, this will continue.  Technology is not bigger than humans, yet it will be very helpful in controlling the  situation. We cannot make dishonest people honest through science. We have to  develop character excellence from childhood. Computer systems are tampered with  and technology is misused. Due to financial inducements or other reasons, power is  misused by public servants and examination centres are misused. There are many  types of corruption like leakage of questions. Our country suffers losses due to this  corruption. Sometimes I feel like treating this as treason. This insults the  Constitution. This violates the justice system. Merit is insulted and corruption is  encouraged. Equal Opportunity for All, which is enshrined in our Constitution, is  violated. The person who has come through corruption, through money power or  other power, will increase corruption by misusing power. Therefore a strict law is  needed. All of them work as an organized criminal group. This is a period of  making history. I support this Bill. Today I have got the opportunity  to put forth my views on the Public Examination (Prevention of Unfair Means)  Bill, 2024. This Bill has come after a very long time to prevent unfair means in the  examinations. This Bill should have been introduced a long time ago. I represent  Rajasthan and almost all the speakers have discussed Rajasthan. Here 17 papers  were leaked in five consecutive years. In Rajasthan, if there is any education hub  after Kota, it is Sikar where two lakh students study and it is my Lok Sabha  constituency. Many colleagues have expressed doubts that no student should be  harmed by this Bill, but upto what extent any student can cheat sitting inside the  examination hall? The problem was that there were such institutions which used to  arrange cheating in a planned manner by taking students as shields. Hence the SIT  has been constituted in Rajasthan. More than 20 people have been arrested so far.  A child committed suicide there. The child left behind him a note written that my  father worked as a labourer and provided me for education for two years, took a  loan on the land, but when I went to appear for the exam, I was informed that the  paper was out. He was a student of Bhadra tehsil of Hanumangarh district. That  student wrote this in the suicide note.  There were so many criminal activities of  this kind.  It is not only a matter of copying, but the worthy people were left and  the unworthy were selected. He had a great loss. The second reason is that injustice  was done with the deserving person. He suffered, so there was no means of taking  away his suffering. Thirdly, it was encouraging corruption. This will make sure  that the person who is worthy, who has worked hard, who has made effort, will get  justice and the person who deserves it will get the opportunity to reach there.  Along With it many colleagues have said that the provision of punishment is very   harsh in it. In our scriptures, a person is disciplined only by the fear of punishment  and without discipline, a system can never be established. Therefore, I would like  to request that efforts should be made to motivate the States also in this direction  because the root cause lies in the states. The minister has mentioned many exams  in this bill itself that he will try this in these examinations.  But with regard to the  situation within the States, I would like to request all the State Governments to  bring these types of Bills there, so that this copying business and this kind of  corruption that is going on, is eliminated and deserving persons are selected. I  would like to thank the Honourable Prime Minister and the Honourable Minister  again that they have brought a good bill and today the two lakh students who study  in my area are happy to see that the Government of India has announced something  good for us. The Government of India has thought about us, about our future. The  dream of the Prime Minister is that we will make a developed India in 2047 will  become a better India only when qualified people reach there and they will reach  only when there are examinations with a fair approach, proper systems are in place,  and unfair resources are stopped. Today a Bill has been brought which  seeks to prevent the use of unfair means in public examination. Now the results of  the examination have nothing to do with the job. Corruption entered into it in such  a way that there was a competition for marks in the institutions and forced all the  states and the government of the country to conduct separate examinations. Earlier,  there were no exams for Government jobs but now this tradition has started. In the  last five years, I have analysed 15 states. Such illegal or inappropriate recruitment  took place at about 41 places in 15 states. There were eligibility tests for the  recruitment of teachers, police, foresters, and engineers. This was the situation in  the last 30-40 years. Bihar is a state where if we cannot set up a factory, then we  study and get a government job that is employment. We the people of Bihar raise  our standard of living by taking government jobs, this is also a formula. The  examination was held in Telangana in 2020, the High Court stayed it. About  150,000 candidates are waiting for it. What is the fault of the children who study  honestly that this kind of situation exists? All these laws should have come a little  earlier. Our Prime Minister should have become the Prime Minister of this country  a little earlier. Had he become the Prime Minister 20-25 years ago, at least many  wrongdoer Chief Ministers would not have been in jail today. They would have  also understood that the law of this country has been so made that if they did  something wrong, they would go to jail. I support this Bill. With the introduction  of this law, in the coming days, honest candidates will get justice and their merit  will be recognized. I support both the Bills. The Constitution  (Jammu and Kashmir) Scheduled Castes Order (Amendment) Bill, 2023 for  Valmiki caste. The inclusion of Valmiki people in the Scheduled Caste List will  enable them to avail the benefits of reservation in jobs, promotions and educational  institutions and join the mainstream of society. In Bihar also the Government of  Bihar has sent its recommendation for according Kewat, Kaur, Kewartt, Dhanuk,  Kahar, Amat, Bind, Beldar, Gangaut, Godhi, Nuniya and Taraha castes the status  of scheduled tribes. I take this opportunity to urge upon the Government that these  castes may also be given the status of Scheduled Tribes. I rise to support the Constitution (Jammu and  Kashmir) Scheduled Castes Order (Amendment) Bill, 2023 and the Constitution  (Jammu and Kashmir) Scheduled Tribes Order (Amendment) Bill, 2023. In these  70 years, in the absence of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe representatives in  Jammu and Kashmir, a lot of injustice has been done to them.  Today, the  downtrodden and neglected society of Jammu and Kashmir is being brought into  the mainstream. After the abrogation of Article 370 by the Government, today,  reservation has been provided in the municipalities, Panchayati Raj and  Assemblies. I hail from Arunachal Pradesh.  Yobin community of Arunachal  Pradesh has been given the status of Scheduled Tribe in the state. My demand is  that the Yobin community living on the borders of Myanmar, Tibet and China  should also be given tribal status by bringing an amendment in the Parliament.    The Union Territory of Jammu and  Kashmir has recommended the inclusion of the Valmiki community as  synonymous with Chura, Bhangi, Valmiki and  Mehtar communities at serial  number 5 of the list of Scheduled Castes of the Union Territory of Jammu and  Kashmir. This is a welcome step.  I myself and my party support this step.   Adequate facilities should be provided by the Government to bring the people of  this society into the mainstream. A large number of SC and ST posts are lying  vacant in the Central and State Governments. The Government should raise the  standard of living of SCs and STs by providing them with permanent employment  by filling backlog vacancies. Apart from that, even today, the Scheduled Castes  and the Scheduled Tribes have zero per cent of the land for cultivation. I demand  from the Government that keeping in view their future, land should be allotted to  them so that they can earn their livelihood.  I would like to mention the four  pillars on which the grant edifice of India is supported. These four pillars are youth  power, women power, farmers and the poor. The government is continuously  endeavouring to provide new opportunities for the youths through education and  skill development. The government is strengthening the sports economy to connect  the country\\u2019s youth with skills and employment.  Our government is working for  women's education, women's safety, economic self-reliance and political  empowerment of women for well well-being and upliftment of women. The  government passed the Nari Shakti Vandan Act to provide them 33% reservation  in the legislature. The \\u2018Lakhpati Didi initiative\\u2019 targets 2 crore women. The  government is providing 15000 drones under NAMO Drone to make women self- reliant. Under the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme, farmers have received over  Rupees 2 at an affordable cost. A subsidy is being provided to purchase  agricultural equipment. Poverty is being eradicated. The government has  constructed 4 crore dwelling units under PM Awas Yojana, more than 11 crore  toilets have been constructed, 10 crore LPG connections have been given, 81 crore  people are given free ration and each house is given tap water. Before Modi, there  were problems, but after Modi, there are solutions. laid a statement regarding In-camera  Proceedings.  (7) laid a statement regarding railway  connectivity between Gaya and Daltonganj.   (8) I rise to speak in support of the  President's Address. The Government has ensured the direct participation of the  common man.  A great example of this was seen by India during its G-20  presidency.  For the first time, such a big international event was held in Jammu  and Kashmir and North-East. The Government is constantly taking new steps for  the education and skill development of India's youth.  For this, a new National  Education Policy was created and it is being implemented rapidly. The  Government is working on more than 14 thousand PM-Shri Vidyalayas. The  enrolment in these Vidyalayas has increased by over 44 % for SC students, over  65% for ST students and over 44% for OBC students. To promote innovation, 10  thousand Atal Tinkering Labs have been established. In the last decade, 16 AIIMS  and 315 medical colleges have been established.  laid a statement regarding Pradhan  Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY).  (23) It is a small Bill, but the gravity of the Bill is  immense as shortcomings exist in the matters related to the court and this Bill  has been brought to rectify them. Without discussing other aspects, I would just  want to say that in the coming days, the judicial process should be very simple,  people should get justice easily and in an affordable manner. This kind of a  system should be in place for all kinds of cases. In the earlier times, the  members of the family and the society used to sit together and find solutions to  such issues, but now a system has evolved that for everything, we have to  approach the court and the cases are not disposed of in time in the court.  Because of this, the people have to face a lot of problems. I would like to make  a small appeal that in all such small issues no one should be punished, if the  people and lawyers of both sides sit together and decide and finally convey their  decision to the court and then we will be able to solve such problemsin large  numbers. Now there is no need for anyone to believe that all the problems will  be solved by enacting a law, and I do not believe at all. I believe that all the  cases should be settled out of the court. It was enunciated by our country  long back about what needs to be done for the people across the world to stem the rot  arising out of the nuclear proliferation. It is alarming to note that still, the world possesses  more than 13,400 nuclear weapons. So, disarmament is the best protection against such  dangers. We have to prepare ourselves for any eventuality. From 1925 to 2017, 10  International Treaties on Weapons of Mass Destruction have been signed. We can't fight  it just by passing laws. Whatever steps are taken to keep our country safe and secure, we  will support them without any hesitation. I rise to support the Weapons of Mass Destruction  and their Delivery Systems (Prohibition of Unlawful Activities) Amendment Bill, 2022.   In Resolution 1540 (2004), the Security Council decided that all States shall refrain from  providing any form of support to actors that attempt to develop, acquire, manufacture,  possess, transport, transfer or use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and their  means of delivery, in particular for terrorist purposes.  The Resolution requires all States  to adopt and enforce appropriate laws to this effect as well as other effective measures to  prevent the proliferation of these weapons and their means of delivery to actors, in  particular for terrorist purposes.  Nonetheless, detecting proliferation-relevant illicit  financing is even harder than detecting money laundering or terrorism financing.  The  risks posed by Weapons of Mass destruction stem not only from ready-made bombs,  nuclear, chemical or radiological material but also from dual-use goods and technology  that are traded, shipped and used globally.  One of the most important areas for the  Government to work upon is on informing the private sector promptly to match changes  in UN designations of entities and individuals.  If the UN Security Council designated  new entities or individuals as proliferators, but a given country failed to update its lists,  what happens is that these financial institutions continue to trade with these entities  because they are not made aware of these changes in time.  So, that is also something that  needs to be considered. I stand here in support of the Bill  that we are discussing today.  India has always had a very good and a positive image of a  peace-loving and peace-making country.  India\\u2019s definition of weapons of mass  destruction is for nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.  So, can we expand it?  I  would like to request that we should consider on broadening the definition of the  Weapons of Mass Destruction.  I would like to talk about some other issues which  nobody else has mentioned the zoonotic diseases.   It is like a pandemic. There is a story  that COVID-19 was attacked which is probably on the globe.  Could we have a broad  discussion on this?  I think that terror-financing is such a thing that must be stopped.  We  support this Bill completely but we must definitely be very careful about the new  technology coming in.  We all are raising our concerns just to make sure that it is a  flawless Bill and make sure that India is known for what it really is. I have a few quick points that I would like to make.    I suggest for consideration of the hon. Minister to attach a schedule to this Bill and list  the Acts, Agreements, and Convention etc which come under the purview of this  legislation.  We have seen umpteen times statements coming from Russia.  If signatories  to the Convention are blatantly breaking it, then, what is the use of this Convention?  We  are going to have the Ninth Review Conference of the Biological Weapons Convention  this year.  I wish to know what would be the approach of India in this Conference, In the  light of ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict,  I wish to know the kind of mechanism and the  national strategy what is in place in the event of a chemical or biological attack.  Several  hon. Members have also asked is about the Corona virus questioning whether it is a  biological attack or not.  I am fully with the hon. Minister and the Government to  ruthlessly crush financing any activity which help in making weapons of mass destruction  and their delivery. As the hon. Minister explained that it is essentially to  make us legally complaint with the mandates of the United Nations Security Council and  the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force.  Could the Minister actually,  throw light as to what steps the Government has taken measures after launch of Brahmos  incident to ensure that something of this sort does not get repeated in future?  In the year  2018, in the Bodh Gaya blast case, the Weapons of Mass Destruction Act was invoked by  the National Investigation Agency.  Could the Minister enlighten us whether chargesheets   were field in terms of these relevant Sections of the WMD Act?  My last point would  relate to our no-first-use posture.  There has a certain amount of ambiguity with regard to  this no-first-use posture.  It would be enlightening to hear from the Minister as to whether  we continue to maintain a no-first-use posture or is there any rethink in Government  which he would like to share with the House? The current conflict in Ukraine is perhaps the most  important  geo-political  event  since  the  pulling  down  of  the  Berlin   Wall in November, 1989.  This war in Ukraine has exposed the limitation of the world  order.  But does it indicate a move towards a new world order?  Everyone is concerned as  to what will happen to the world economy and not just economy of a region or a few  countries, but the ramifications it will have across the world.  We are talking about a  country which is engulfed in a war.  It is not as if the Government did not issue  advisories.  These were exceptional advisories which were issued in the month of January  and registration was opened up.  More than twenty thousand Indians registered  themselves with the Indian Embassy.  But, the situation was so fluid that no one knew for  sure that war is actually going to happen.  All efforts were made to coordinate with  Ukraine and Russia and also other neighbouring countries of Ukraine.  So to expect a  very easy way out, is to expect the moon.  I congratulate the Government for  starting Operation Ganga. The geopolitical tension between Russia and Ukraine has led  to steep increase in prices of global commodities, including prices of crude oil, gas,  edible oils, and fertilizers. As per the feedback received from industry, the exports of  some products like pharmaceuticals, telecom instruments, and coffee and tea from India  are likely to be affected. Evacuation means bringing a person out from the area of crises.  But here, the students had to walk several kilometres and pay exorbitant amount to hire  vehicles to reach the borders. Actually, our Government acted late. The tuition fee in  private medical colleges in India ranges from Rs.60 lakh to Rs.1 crore. This is far beyond  the capacity of middle-class people. Therefore, the students look for relatively less cost- effective institutions in other countries. We are actually unable to provide medical  education at affordable rate inside the country. It is important to see that the career of  these young students does not suffer. In the conflict that is going on between Russia and  Ukraine, thousands of people have been killed and lakhs have been displaced. Weapons  manufacturers are working to earn a lot of profit by selling weapons. Japan and Germany  have spoken of rearming themselves. Europe is rearming itself. Today again a war is  going on between us, which we are witnessing in Ukraine. The entire international  community has completely failed to stop this centuries-long conflict which has turned  into a war. Today, the policy of India is that this war should be stopped by getting this  whole issue peacefully and diplomatically resolved. India has to show great skill to deal  with this matter. We believed in a completely fair foreign policy and we are still  following it. Inflation is increasing in our markets. Be it the price of metals and  petroleum or the price of food items or the price of fertilizers, there is an increase in the  price of everything. Thank you, Chairman Sir. I congratulate and thank  for the historic work done by Hon'ble Minister of External Affairs Jaishankar ji,  Honorable Minister Scindia ji, Honorable Minister Rijiju ji, Honorable Minister Hardeep  Singh Puri ji and V. K. Singh sahib ji Under the leadership of Prime Minister. As I heard  the debate, it seemed that India's foreign policy was made only after 1947 and Nehru ji  founded it. Earlier there was no foreign policy at all. When 5000 people of Poland were  looking for shelter everywhere during the Second World War, then the Raja of Jamnagar  gave shelter to those 5000 people of Poland in Gujarat. It is because of the same Gujarati  connection that the Polish government supported our students, our people. So foreign  policy didn\\u201ft start with Nehru ji. When Bharatiya Janata Party formed the government in  the year 2014-15, it said that now our foreign policy will run on the basis of  Panchamrita. Panchamrita means we will live with dignity. Today foreign policy will be  governed by dialogue. Honorable Prime Minister has such power, this country has such  power that it can save itself in this war and can also stop the war. We have signed an FTA  with Australia for the first time. Foreign policy should be discussed in this country, who  made China our neighbor? You say that we always abuse Nehru, we abuse Congress.  The situation in Ukraine is not self-made like we are  seeing in Sri Lanka today.  Vladimir Putin\\u201fs dream is becoming Ukraine\\u201fs nightmare.  The threat of chemical war is also a major concern. Russia unfolded its hybrid war  against Ukraine. The stand taken by India, be it at the UN Security Council or at QUAD  Foreign Ministers\\u201f meeting at Melbourne is welcome. This is the stand of India, that  cooperation and collaboration will help douse the conflict between Russia and Ukraine  and ensure long-term peace and stability in the region. With pressure mounting from the  West led by the US, we have to make a very difficult strategic choice between principles  and values on one side and pragmatism and interest on the other. The time has come  where we need to move closer to the US and the QUAD Summit in May this year is one  such opportunity for India. we have been adopting a non-aligned approach. We have  taken sides or worked closely with world powers only when national interest is involved.   in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, I do not see any national interest involved. I  have a few economic bullet points. More than 500 million dollars\\u201f worth of exporters  payments are stuck in Russia due to sanctions. Ukraine is the third largest producer and  exporter of maize and Ukraine and Russia are also top two exporters of sunflower oil  which we import. Russia is also the world\\u201fs second largest exporter of muriate of potash  fertilizer which we import. Out of 5.09 metric tonnes that we import, one-third come  from Belarus and Russia. Ukraine is the third largest supplier of urea to India. We are  also importing crude oil from Russia, Exports from India like medicines, tea, etc. to  Russia are impacted due to shipment concerns and there is also shortage of containers. A  carefully calibrated stand by New Delhi has created a distinctive space for diplomacy by  not only maintaining equi-distance between the two powers but also moving towards a  multipolar world. Sir, it sounds like music that the  statesmanship of Pandit Nehruji has been remembered again given the contemporary  political and diplomatic situation prevailing across the world. Shri Kiren Rijiju rightly  said that whoever in the government, they should have fulfilled this responsibility, we are  fulfilling the responsibility. That is our tradition. Still why do we debate? If there is any  mistake, alerting the government, advising the government, this is the duty of the  opposition, which we do. First, I would say that Could we explore any idea that Indian  Parliament could pass a unanimous resolution to suggest both the warring countries of  Russia and Ukraine that they may restrain from their present situation? Jaishankar ji is a  tall and capable foreign minister. I want to ask him a couple of questions, First, does the  Ukraine-Russia conflict really test India's Foreign Policy resilience?, What are the  complications outlining India's restraint?  I support the Constitution (Scheduled  Castes and Scheduled Tribes) Orders (Amendment) Bill, 2022 which seeks to omit the  Entry of Bhogta community from the list of Scheduled Castes and also, it seeks to bring  in certain communities in the list of Scheduled Tribes. We must remember Dr. B.R.  Ambedkar\\u201fs remarks that a free society in India is a far distant possibility till the ill- treatment and suppression of one class by the other is there. Equality could also be a  fiction nonetheless one should settle for it as a governing precept. We have to have  equality in the society. Celebration of birthday of Birsa Munda, setting up of Eklavya  Model Residential Schools and announcing scholarship by Prime Minister Modi\\u201fs  Government to the 30 lacs students of these schools shows its commitment towards  tribals. Antodaya, Jal Jeevan Mission and Swachh Bharat Scheme are some of efforts  being made for upliftment of tribals and downtrodden. With the passing of the Constitution (Scheduled  Castes and Scheduled Tribes) Orders (Amendment) Bill, 2022, these communities will  definitely have economic and educational development and they will get the benefit of  development. SC/STs are still at a backstage in the flow of development, it is necessary  to bring them into the mainstream. A distinguished member in the Constituent Assembly  had said that the credit for India's independence will be given to Mahatma Gandhiji and  the credit to codify India's independent regime will be given to Dr. Ambedkar, the great  architect of our great Constitution. There is much more to be done by the society in our  country. Many people from the disadvantaged sections do not know about their rights and  the various programmes being run by the Government in their interests. These  communities should be informed and made aware about welfare schemes. The extension of train no. 12505/06 North-East  Express, Kamakhya- Annand Vihar Terminal, can connect passengers of Jhunjhunu,  Sikar and Jaipur.  Since initial maintenance of train no. 12505/6 is undertaken at  Kamkhaya and it keeps stationed for about ten hours at Annand Vihar Terminal.  By  increasing one rake of this train, this train can ply from Jhunjhunu to Jaipur via Sikar.    What justice stands to mean is that the criminals  should be taken to task and justice be delivered to the victims. This sensitivity is called  for in the judicial system. If we want to build the best country, we will have to enact good  laws. It is said that our eco-system is not in order and then the question arise as to how to  fix it. That\\u201fs why I am making my points on this issue. The conviction rate is merely  14.35 per cent which entails that about 85 per cent of the criminals get scot-free.  Therefore, the faith of the common people in the judicial system is getting undermined.  People say that the police personnel do not conduct scientific investigation. This Bill has  been brought in to make that very scientific investigation possible. The 87th report of the  Law Commission of India reveals that the criminal justice system of the country is very  colonial and heavily tilted in favour of criminal. Hence, good and stern laws are required  to be enacted and enforced properly as well. It is being said repeatedly that the law will  be misused. Let me know which law is not misused. We have so much political will  power that we will not allow it to be misused. I would like to support this Bill  and say that it is very important for the people of the country to understand that even their  single vote is very important for the development of the country. Everyone must vote and  all the facilities to those people should be stopped who do not vote. Compulsory voting is  very important so that we can all actively participate in the democratic process. Voting  I.D. of every voter should be compulsorily linked with his or her Aadhaar so that no one  dares to cast any bogus vote. The Army and paramilitary forces should be exempted from  compulsory voting as they are stationed at different places for the security of the country.  Compulsory voting will also be useful for crime identification as well as for education,  health and economy of the country. Earlier, the voting percentage in Jammu and Kashmir  was very low, but since the abrogation of Article 370, the voting percentage there has  gone up and the democracy is getting stronger. Many youths from Ladakh and other parts  of the country study in different corners of the country. We also need to consider how to  provide voting facilities to these youth. The sport is one topic which  unifies every nation whether we are playing cricket or football or other sports. The beauty  of sports is that it is about discipline, teamwork and a lot of hard work that goes behind.  The contribution of Khelo India Programme is really great. It is a very encouraging step  for the new generation.We should just rise above politics in sports. The infrastructure of  sports has improved. There is some more way for our States to improve our  infrastructure, it is good. Indian cricket is discussed almost like you discuss politics on  every dining table. The IPL is a great success story that India has seen, and a lot of new  talent has come with it. It is the same thing with Kabaddi and Pro-Kabaddi. They even  get financial support because there are sponsors in this game. Today, the BCCI is  autonomous and football league is autonomous, and they are doing a good job. So, the  Government does not necessarily have to interfere but if you can complement each other,  it is overall good for the sports sector. There are two sports, outside of Khelo India, that  we need to promote. One is traditional sports and the other is adventure sports. Adventure  sports is a very big business in tourism. With the unemployment challenges and with the  global crisis, tourism is a very big option and so adventure tourism and traditional  tourism can open up a lot of doors for youngsters who can make their hobby into careers.  Sports unifies society at large and the country at large. Games in India has witnessed various  stages of change from ancient to modern times. There is no dearth of talents in our  country but we cannot win medals in the world competition just by having talents. For  that, we need technology in sports, better training, good exercise, right eating habits and  positive environment. The Government has decided to continue Khelo India scheme for  development of sports during the period of 15th Finance Commission (2021-22 to 2025- 26) with an outlay of Rs. 3165.50 crore. From the year 2017 to 2021, three editions of  Khelo India School and Youth Games, one edition of Khelo India University Games and  two editions of Khelo India Winter Games have been organized. More than 20,000  sportspersons participated in these games out of which about 3,000 sportspersons have  been identified as Khelo India Athletes (KIA) who are getting training in new form of  SAI centres i.e. Khelo India Academies at present. The Government has sanctioned 282  sports infrastructure projects of various types of worth Rs. 2,328 crore during the last five  years. Sports stadiums may be constructed in Shri Karanpur, Shri Vijaynagar,  Sadulshahar and Suratgarh under my Parliamentary Constituency, Shri Ganganagar and Pilibanga and Sangaria under Hanumangarh district under Khelo India scheme. An  archery academy may be set up in Rajasthan. There are several countries where the  dual model of accounting institutes exists. Confusion has been created by the existence of  two titles and both CMAs and CAs co-exist in harmony rendering service to the society.  The 45th Report of Standing Committee clearly recommended for change in nomenclature  of Cost and Works Accountants to Cost and Management Accountants. It is observed that  the Ministry is ignoring the demand of Cost Accountants for more than three decades I  urge the Finance Minister to consider my humble request. Clauses 21, 56 and 89 in the  Bill prevent a complainant from withdrawing the complaint. In any of the Bills, such  prohibition of withdrawals is not found. It is a fundamental right of any individual to  withdraw the case filed by him/her.  I would request the hon. Finance Minister to kindly  consider dropping of clause 32,67 and 100 from the said Bill. We have seen failure of  insolvency and Bankruptcy Law for following timelines given by the courts. Hence, it is  proposed to remove the timelines given in these clauses. Some provisions lack natural  justice to the complainant and respondent by not providing them any opportunity to file a  rejoinder. I rise to oppose the Bill. In this Bill,  changes have been proposed to existing legislations governing the apex Institutes of  Chartered Accountants, Cost Accountants and Company Secretaries. The unprecedented  provisions of appointing two non-CAs as members out of three members in the Board  may have a larger impact as the work of CAs would be majorly judged by non-CAs.  The  Institute of Chartered Accountants of India has raised concerns over the proposal to have  non-Chartered Accountant as the Presiding Officer of its Disciplinary Committee. At  present, the President or the Vice President of ICAI acts as the Presiding Officer, and it is  the practice that the Institute wants to continue. I would like to say that we should trust  our CAs. They have been working for us the last 75 years with much dedication. They are  also the nation builders. So, Let us give them more autonomy rather than taking away the  autonomy and saying that we are providing autonomy.  I would like to speak on the Chartered Accountants,  the Cost and Works Accountants and the Company Secretaries (Amendment) Bill, 2021.  Indian Institute of Chartered Accountants is the only institute in the country. The  Standing Committee itself has given a report in which they have categorically mentioned  that appointing a Chairman or a President for the disciplinary committee from the  bureaucracy is objectionable. The institute has served the country for many years. Even  in finalising the taxation also, they have come forward and helped the Government. As  far as NCLT is concerned, I would like to know from the hon. Minister  that after the  formation of the NCLT, what are the decisions given by the NCLT.  The company which  is having a capital of around thousands of crore of rupees is being sold for a few crores of  rupees. I request the hon. Minister, through you, to please send this Bill to a Select  Committee. Let us discuss it elaborately and let us come up with a very good Bill which  will protect the investors and which will serve the Institute also. The economic development of the country will  get impetus and there will be equal growth in all the sectors after the passage of the  current Appropriation Bill. The Government is looking at the steps taken under the  Atmanirbhar Bharat as criteria of progress in the financial year 2020-21 and giving  momentum to development. The Government has made a proposal to approve subsidy on  manure which is important for the farmers. The Ministry has made provision of Rs.  49,000 crore for different schemes related to food storage and warehousing which will  strengthen the sector. I would like to urge that train facility from my Parliamentary  constituency Gopalganj to Delhi may be provided in order to develop the said rural area.  Pace of development will certainly increase with more expenditure in the infrastructure  sector. At present, the government has done a  good job during the corona epidemic. My request to the government is that like the Indian  Administrative Service, if the Indian Health Services is formed at the central and state  level, then it can do a great work in making health policies and improving health services.  Spending on public health in our country is still a lot of work compared to other  countries. On the one hand, the government is closing our MPLAD funds and on the  other hand, in the last three years, the government has spent Rs 1698 crores only on  advertisements. It is very important to invest more and more on health. The government  should focus more on treatment, not on dissemination and propaganda. The  Pharmaceutical Technology Upgradation Assistant Scheme, approved in the year 2016,  has not been launched yet. More API manufacturing needs to be there in India. There is a  need to increase sustainable infrastructure investment. The Hon. Prime Minister had  announced National Infrastructure Pipeline under which an investment of Rs. 111 lakh  crore would be required in the next four years. This will help us make our economy 5  trillion dollar economy by the year 2025.  I agree that Parliament is not  always about criticising each other. There are something we all agree on, especially the  pandemic. Our State Government and the Central Government have been working  together during Covid-19 pandemic. We worked better and managed to save people\\u2019s  lives in an extra ordinary situation. My only submission is that there is a huge difference  between what is shown on the dashboard and the ground reality MNREGS is a  programme absolutely for the people at the bottom of the Pyramid. So both State and the  Central Government need to work together to strengthen it. Likewise, social sector  programmes like post-matric scholarship of SC students must not be covered within  austerity measures. The Government keeps claiming that GST is doing very well. I would  like to know as to why there is delay in payment of GST to the states. Several members  talked about MPLADS. I am really proud to share that in Maharashtra there has not been  even a single rupee cut in any MLAs funds during the entire Covid time. As regards Jal  Jiwan Mission involving the infusion of Rs. 3 lakh crore, the operation and maintenance  remains a big challenge. I would like to ask the Hon. Minister how we are going to take  forward the O&M of this programme. A lot has been said about MPLADS, GST,  scholarship, NREGA but my only concern is about MSMEs. I am not against any big  company which is doing well. But at the same time the survival of MSMEs must not be  compromised. The funds collected through cess of various nature go to the consolidated  funds of India. This is a loss to all the States. This needs to be addressed. I demand hike  in the wages of ASHA workers and the other health workers. The states are absolutely  going a through  very difficult time. We need to put all our minds together and take  feedback from the States to make India better. The key feature of the current  Supplementary Demands for Grants is the clearance for an additional spending. This is  the Second Batch of the Supplementary Demands for Grant for the current fiscal year.  This involves a higher-than-expected net cash outgo of Rs. 2,99,243 crore and the rest  would be met through savings or enhanced receipts of various Ministries and  Departments. I would like to list out a few issues also, including Polavaram - 2nd Revised  Cost Estimate. The Government has approved Rs. 8,786 crore for the Ministry of Jal  Shakti under various Heads. The 2nd revised cost estimate for Rs. 55,656.87 crore for the  Polavaram Irrigation Project is still pending with Government. I would like to speak  about MGNREGS. Under Supplementary Demands for Grants, the Government has  rightly allocated Rs. 22,039 crore for rural jobs under NREGS. The National Rural  Employment Guarantee Scheme had become the main source of livelihood for many  people. India\\u2019s struggle against Covid-19 is  still continuing in the year 2021. The political, economical and strategic  relations in the whole world is changing after Covid. A vision of self-reliant  India has been released in the Union Budget 2021-22. Doubling of farmers\\u2019  income and improving infrastructure have included in the said vision. My  Constituency is a major hub of MSMEs. India\\u2019s 75 year old automobile  company Tata Motors is running in my Lok Sabha Constituency Jamshedpur.  If the Government set up a big automobile company around Jamshedpur  industrial area, full utilization of MSME hub located in the whole eastern zone  including Jamshedpur and Adityapur region can be possible. In India the practice of the President  addressing Parliament after the Constitution came into force in 1950. The  President was required to address each session of Parliament and this continued  during the Provisional Parliament in 1950. The First Amendment to the  Constitution in 1951 changed the position and made President\\u201fs address once a  year. The policy of the Government is pronounced in the President\\u201fs address.  This year Hon\\u201fble President broadly spoke on economy and finance, health and  Covid-19, Agriculture and Food Distribution, Manufacturing and job creation. It is  a point to note that 38 crore poor persons have been able to open Bank accounts  and implementation as 450 schemes has been linked to Direct Benefit Transfers  to prevent leakages. Thereby Rs. 1.8 lakh crore have been saved through the  use of Jan Dhan Accounts, Aadhaar and Mobile. Since 2014, more than 13 lakh  crore rupees has been transferred to bank accounts of beneficiaries through  Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), between April and August 2020, foreign direct  investment of 36 billion dollars been made in India and India\\u201fs ranking in the  Ease of Doing Business Index has improved. We have managed the pandemic  by developing a network of 2200 Labs, and manufacturing thousands of  ventilators, PPE kits, and test kits domestically. India is also conducting the  world\\u201fs largest COVID-19 vaccination programme. The Union Government,  during the stringent lockdown saved lives and controlled infections. The protests  around the world against widening inequality and rising authoritarianism are  being witnessed. Nonviolent protest movements don\\u201ft alienate anyone. They  keep the windows of opportunity open to conversion. This should be the way of  ongoing farmers\\u201f agitation. There has been a tendency of the Union to expand he  Concurrent List, at the cost of States' exclusive, legitimate powers. The division  of functions enshrined under Seventh Schedule of Constitution has got  increasingly eroded over a period of time with the shifting of the subjects like  forest and education from the State to the Concurrent List by the 42nd  Amendment of the Constitution. The Constitution provides strong separation of  power between judiciary and the legislature and the judiciary and the executive.  The Constitution grants the judiciary the power to review executive action. The  President\\u201fs address is one of the most Solemn occasions in the Parliamentary  Calendar. The event is associated with the ceremony and protocol. It has  remained so since 1950 and has developed into a custom. We have started the world's biggest  vaccination programme in the country during global pandemic crisis and made  available these two vaccines to other nations as well.  The goal of 'Atmanirbhar  Bharat'  will further strengthen by making agriculture sector self reliant.  The  Government has made positive reforms in agriculture sector.  The Parliament  has passed three Farm Bills presented by the Government. The priority of the  Government is to improve standard of living in rural India and, therefore, it has  implemented 'Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana', 'SVAMITVA Yojana', 'Deen Dayal  Antodya Yojana' and 'National Rural Livelihood Mission'. The women  entrepreneurs have important role in making India self-reliant. The Government  has formulated a National Education Policy and launched digital programme in  the country.  The Government has subsumed 21 Central labour laws under four  labour codes.  The country is being engaged in developmental works under  Atmanirbhar Bharat.  The Government gives top priority to integrity and security  of the country. The Government takes strict action against cross border attacks  and against internal violence as well.  We fought against Corona last year and  with same energy we have to achieve new goals of the present year. The agitation against  agricultural laws is now being discussed globally. It is extremely unfortunate  that lies and confusion are being spread. The movement being run is under  discussion, but there is no discussion on those agricultural laws which are at  its core. The truth is that these laws have given freedom to the farmers. There  is no restriction on the farmer to follow these laws. The old system is still in  operation, mandis are functioning, procurement is being done on MSP. The  government should try to launch a widespread campaign to sensitise the  people about the facts of these three farm laws so that the people may come  to realise that this farmer agitation is taking place on an edifice of falshehood.  Mandis are not closing, procurement is still going on and will continue on  MSP, and there is no compulsion for contract farming. The fact that old  system will continue, is the truth, and  all needs to understand it. Regarding farmers agitation, our Government  has the highest sympathy towards farmers and 12 rounds of meeting have  been held for the solution. It is my humble request to all the farmers/ farmers\\u2018  leaders, who are agitating in the Delhi Border, not to think oppositely. We  stood first in supporting the world in difficult time, either by medicine or by  vaccine. We have created the post of \\u2017Chief of Defence Staff\\u2018.  We are also  working on \\u2017Atmanirbhar Bharat\\u2018 on defence production and we are working  on increasing the participation of women in the Defence Department. We have more than 30,000 registered chit  fund companies in the country with a turnover of more than Rs.40,000 crore.  But  if you look at the unregistered chit fund operators, they are 25 times more than the  registered ones.  The chit fund industry is unregulated and under-governed.  We  have innumerable examples of lakhs of people being duped by unregulated  deposits.  It is happening in spite of the Chit Funds Act, 1982, preventing such chit  funds from being operated.  When the parent Act itself is not able to control and  contain the unregistered chit fund operators or companies, how does this Bill help  in containing them?  South India accounts for one-third of the country\\u201fs  chit fund  business.   I request the hon. Minister to kindly consider giving chit funds also 90 \\u2013 per cent abatement and remove GST on chit funds as is the case with NBFCs.   There is a need to provide the insurance cover for deposits or subscription to chit  funds.  With these observations, I support the Bill. I unequivocally stand to support the Government's  measure by way of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Bill, 2019. On earlier  occasions also, our party had supported the only 'Article of Faith' which India  proclaims that the entire State of J&K shall be an integral part of India and that any  attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of India will be met resolutely.  It was  always known that Article 370 is going to be temporary, transitional and special  provision.  That is in part 21 of the Constitution.  Generations upon generations  have been taught that Kashmir is not an integral part of India.  This is  impermissible in the Constitution.  Again, the fact of the matter is that the manner  in which the Government has gone about it is not the first time this has happened.   Under Article 370(1)(d), 45 Presidential Orders from 1950 with regard to Jammu  and Kashmir have been passed.  So the Order of 2019 of a similar nature that  supersedes all previous Orders.  This House has always been recognized as the  supreme sovereign body under the Constitution.  Therefore, this House always has  the power to deal with these exigencies and these situations.  So, I do not believe  that there should be any talk about any breach of faith.  I am of the opinion that this  august House should come together and send a message to our brothers and sisters  of Kashmir that they are integral to our Indian family.  There must be unanimity  within India because if we appear divided, we give a lot of power to forces outside  India to criticize us on this.  At the same time, there are certain historical issues  which need to be ironed out.      There are two types of problems in Surrogacy  (Regulation) Bill. This Bill has been brought in pursuance of the order of Supreme  Court. Supreme Court has taken cognizance of two peculiar types of incidents. One  Israeli couple came to Chennai for getting a surrogate mother as both of them were  infertile. They got a surrogate mother.   The Jallianwala  Bagh incident had shaken the whole country.  Alluri Sitarama Raju was a very  great freedom fighter from Andhra Pradesh who had led the Rampa rebellion  against the British.  He was very much moved by the Jallianwala Bagh incident.  I  am bringing in this mention here because the committee has already approved the  proposal to install his statue in the Parliament complex.  The statue is also ready.   So, I request the hon. House to unveil his statue on this 100th Anniversary of  Jallianwala Bagh.  There is a proposal in this Bill to remove the name of the  President of the Indian National Congress.  As a middle path, the Government can  consider to have any other leader of the Indian Congress Party in the Trust. We all have to remember  that this is a discussion regarding Indian freedom struggle.  It needs to be  respected.  It is not just one party that has fought for the freedom.  We should not  associate the freedom struggle with any political party.  We also have to remember  that there have been many freedom fighters from South India also.  Alluri Sitarama  Raju was one of the greatest freedom fighters from the land of Andhra Pradesh.   We should take the freedom struggle as an opportunity for all Indians to unite  together. The Congress was formed for the public  movement only after the arrival of Mahatma Gandhi in the year 1915.  Prior to it, it  was none other than the Britishers who was leading the Congress.  Whether the  names of Satyapal ji and Kichlu ji should not have been included in the Jallianwala  Bagh Memorial.  In 1947, Mahatma Gandhi was of the opinion that the election  would be held according to the democratic process and the Congress should be  relegated to the past. Hundred years have passed since the  Jallianwala Bagh massacre took place.  The Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial  are required to be made free from all sorts of politics.  We failed to institute even a  statue of the martyr Udham Singh Ji, however, we spend a lot of time here on  discussing about the martyrs. Water is a resource which has traditionally  been governed by the three doctrines the world over, namely, public trust, riparian  rights and proper appropriation.  This particular Bill takes away the power of the  State Government to manage dam safety and, thus, it infringes upon the federal  structure.  This Bill is completely silent on the devolution of funds from the Centre  to the States to carry out the various measures for dam safety.  The National  Committee on Dam Safety will be consisting of 21 members and all of them are  nominated by the Central Government.  The States should have representation in  this Committee.  The National Dam Safety Authority should have been put under a  senior level officer.  The constitution of the State Committee on Dam Safety  should be left to the States.  The Union Government should take financial  responsibility for dam safety.  The State Dam Safety Organisation should not  override the existing State level bodies.  The Section 41 which deals with  punishment for obstruction in duty, is a very draconian Section.  The National Dam  Safety Authority should play a supportive and consultative role.  The Chairman of  the Central Water Commission should not be the Chairperson of the National  Committee on Dam Safety because it causes conflict of interest. We want to double the income of  farmers, we want to provide irrigation facility for every agricultural field.  We talk  about 'Per Drop More Crop', but we cannot achieve all these things without dams.   There is acute shortage of water in my constituency.  There is also the problem of  drinking water in my constituency.  Ground water in my area has fluoride content.   Hence, there is need to build dams in my constituency. I would like to draw the  attention of the hon. Minister towards the dam built on Narmada river in the  Khargone district in Madhya Pradesh.  The construction of this dam was completed  around eight to ten years ago, only its gate has to be closed.  There are some legal  issues in closing that gate.  We would be able to provide water to Indore, the  industrial capital of Madhya Pradesh, only when the gate of the dam is closed.   There is provision of National Committee on Dam Safety in this Bill, which   consists of dam experts and members nominated by the Central and State  Governments.  There are different reasons for the failure of different kinds of  dams.  This Bill was essential to address all these causes for dam failure. My Parliamentary Constituency Udaipur is  known as the city of lakes.   Jaisamand Dam which is around 289 years old is  located in this area.  Mahi Bajaj Sagar Dam situated in Bansvada district is also a  major dam in Udaipur Division but overflows every year.   The excess water from  this dam should be channelized to Jakham Dam in Pratapgarh district from where it  may be channelized to Dariabag and from Gravity to Jaismund.   I request the  Government that the excess water of Mahi should be channelized to Jaisamand  dam and  supplied  to Udaipur.  In order to provide potable water to the people of  Udaipur,1000 MCFT water should be supplied to Udaipur city through Dewas  Dam Project. I would like to request you to include  one representative of the fishermen community and another representative of the  farmers' community in the National Dam Security Committee constituted on the  basis of Dam Safety Bill.  The committee will regulate dams, check the dams from  destruction, enquire into the causes of destruction of the big dams and monitor all  of them.  This has a provision of offence and its punishment.  When a complaint of  an offence is lodged by Government or any authority constituted under the Bill, it  will be a cognizable offence.  I would like to know about the third party to fire the  criteria of an offence in case of Government failure or federation failure.  If any  personal complaint is received in this regard; its cognizance should be taken.  I  would like to discuss about the Tawa project which provides irrigation water to  three to four districts.  There is no continuous silt accumulation there.  A  monitoring committee to be constituted in this regard will look after its  management and security and also the restoration system of reducing capacity of  water storage of the dam, the measures to increase the capacity of checking the  water.  The Barangi dam was constructed in the year 1982 and Narsinghpur district  got its supply of water in 2001-07.  The dam's construction work kept on going  continuously for about 25 years.  There should be check and balances in this  regard, the dam should be constructed within a prescribed time limit so as to avoid  cost exceeding.  The water from the Bargi is to be supplied to Satna.  I would like  to ask the reasons for constructing a tunnel on plain land.  The constructed part of  the tunnel in four and a half kilometers only and the remaining part of twelve  kilometers is yet to be constructed.  That canal may pass through the land.  It  should be checked and measurement be taken to supply water of Bargi dam to  everywhere. The Government has tried to  improve the law and order situation in Arbitration and Conciliation Act. Formal  institutional mechanisms establishment is what this particular Act is trying to  establish. The twin objective of all these Acts put together has been: efficient  disposal of commercial disputes, and international and national disputes which  happen. This Act is particularly trying to make the whole thing more efficient,  bring justice at the doorsteps and help people resolve their commercial disputes.  This Act is trying to ensure efficient and effective resolution of commercial  disputes, fairness in the process. I have also pointed out earlier that for everything,  you do not have to approach the High Court or the Supreme Court. But their  involvement in the process has to be there. So, appointment of arbitrators needs to  be done in a very transparent manner. As far as fairness in the process is concerned  confidentially clause is a very important clause. This enactment is trying to set up  an Arbitration Council of India. Constitution of ACI consists of experienced  Judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts including eminent persons  having the expertise in administration of arbitration and ancient arbitration  practitioners units experience in research and teaching in the field of arbitration.   Providing accreditation to the arbitrators are part of the duties and functions of the  ACI. The strengthening of enforceability award is necessary and that enforceability  needs to be taken care of by the system. The council has to maintain an electronic  depository of the awards being granted which also forms part of this particular  amendment which the Government is seeking to bring. As far as fast-tracking of  entire litigation is concerned, the time limit of 12 months has been prescribed and  that is very important. Setting up a time limit and easy disposal are provisions in  this Act. I have just the simple suggestion to make to the hon. Minister. If in the  rules or somewhere, this can be introduced that if both the sides consent to  applicability of 2015 enactment even if the dispute is pre-2015 era, pre-BALCO  etc. We will find easy resolution and both the conflicting sides can opt to come  under this particular enactment. I support this Bill.  This Bill is for  authorized persons entitled for government accommodations, be it bureaucrats or  Ministers or Members of Parliament.  It is often observed that Members of  Parliament, Ministers and Government officers take long time in evacuating the  government accommodations after completing their term in office.  When we were  elected as Members of Parliament, we were asked to fill up our priority for  government accommodation.  But we observed that our priority is not getting fixed  due to unauthorized occupants in the government accommodations.  I hope that we  will soon get new accommodation after this Bill is passed. It is concerned not only to Delhi but the whole  country also.  The officers or the employees who are in possession of government  accommodation do not want to vacate it. They want to retain their accommodations  for a long time even after their retirement. Whenever an action is taken against  them, they go to court and get a stay order from the court either on medical ground  or some other family problems. They face difficulties in getting an  accommodation. The Members of Parliament, the employees or the officers are  supposed to get a government accommodation. It is genuinely a Bill intended to give some  relief to our workers.  The definition of 'worker', 'employee', 'employer', and  'establishment' is comprehensive so that everybody has access to the benefits that  are contemplated under the Bill.  For the first time, a concept of floor wages has  been introduced.  The floor wages will give the base, the floor, and leave the  ceiling for the States.  Employment, adequate and reasonable wages and recovery  of wages \\u2013 this is what an employee wants.  This Bill takes care of all the three  aspects of the problem. Section 45 of the Bill contemplates an authority which, for  the first time, is given the power to order payment of compensation in addition to  the claim determined.  A new concept of inspector-cum-facilitator has been  introduced.  The appeal for payment of wages would go to the district judge  concerned from the Payment of Wages Authority.  That would be dealt by the  district judge.  But here, instead of district judge, a provision is given for  appointment of an Appellate Authority by the Government. The amalgamation of four Acts will  facilitate the implementation and also remove the multiplicity of definitions and  authorities without compromising on the basic concept of welfare and benefits of  workers in the country. I hope this Bill will address about 14 definitions of wages  in the different laws which has a lot of litigation and also difficult in its  implementation.  Provision has been made for the State Advisory Board in this  Bill. These Advisory Boards have a very important role in the Code of Wages Bill.  There should be a provision for domain expert in these Advisory Boards who can  know the issues on the field for which these advisory boards are working. I would  also like to suggest that revision of minimum rates of wages should be linked with  \\u201eConsumer Price Index\\u201f so that the workers or employers, covered under this  Code, can be protected from rise in price and inflation in the market.  The  Government should strengthen the system for identification of our informal sector  workforce to protect the interests of labourers in unorganized sector.  The trend of  contractual employment has increased. We have not made any provision to check  the exploitation of contractual workers and labourers. I have a doubt how the Code  on Wages Bill, 2-019 is going to address these very much important issues. The  lack of consistency in definitions within the Code may lead to employers  discriminating between workers and employees. Since minimum wage is a matter  of right for every working person, a common and comprehensive definition of  employees or workers should be given in the Code and experience and length of  service and experience in the field or in the organization or otherwise should also  be taken into account while fixing minimum wages. The matter which has come up  before the House with regard to me did not reflect my deliberate act of  disrespecting the lady Chairperson. Still, if the Chair feels that my intent was  disrespectful and I had any ill-feelings towards the Chair, I apologise.         Thereupon, the hon. Speaker made the following observation:- There are many regulations in this Act  which have to be strictly implemented to regulate the finance companies, chit fund  companies and whatever finance schemes are there that are cheating the people.   Other than this deposit scheme, we have this call money scheme in State of Andhra  Pradesh which might be seen at other places in the country also may be by some  other name.  With the help of the money earned illegally by charging such high  interest rates, they are actually managing the whole system and harassing the small  people. I welcome you on the Chair as the  Hon. Speaker of the House. I believe that the Parliament should mainly belong to  the Opposition so that the Parliamentary democratic functioning can be more  strengthened.  What we feel is that the majoritarianism sometimes affects the  normal functioning of the House.  Whether a House will run or function properly  or not, it depends maximum on the Treasury Bench\\u2019s side.  We want to assure you  that we are very much in favour of that the discussion takes place on the floor of  the House. So, I would request you to look at both the  sides, that is, left and the  right sides. I am glad that one of my best friends is going  to grace the Chair.  I wish that the dignity of this House will increase under his  guidance.  I wish him good luck. He has been  into politics for a very long time.  In the backdrop of his rich organizational   experience as a  student leader, a social activist and as a Member of  Legislative  Assembly and this august House, I hope that this House will play a very positive  and crucial role in future under his able leadership. I, on behalf of myself and my Party,  congratulate him on this occasion.  I would like to request him that as a Speaker he  should run the House in a way that we, in the opposition, should not feel  discriminated against.  I would also like to add that he should give more  opportunity to those Members who have been elected first time. Today, it gives me immense pleasure  to speak about you.  You are the leader of common man and also a social worker.   You are son of a farmer also.  Taking the Chair with such a rich background gives  the hope to everyone in the House that they will get justice and equal opportunity.    We all want that the way all hon. Members have supported your nomination, the  same way the hon. Members of all parties, be the small one or the large one will  get justice and fair opportunity. Hon. Speaker, Sir, saying anything  about you is like showing the lamp to the sun.   First, I on the behalf of the national  President of our party Shri Ramvilas Paswan ji and on the behalf of the Lok Jan  Shakti Party congratulate you and express our good wishes to you.  I also express  my thanks to hon. Prime Minister for proposing the best possible name for this  august Chair.   The entire House has supported this name.   I hope that all the  Members in the House will be benefitted by your rich experience.  You are the  source of inspiration for all the young Members like us.   I do believe that all the  smaller parties will get your patronage and all the Members will get ample  opportunity to put forth their views in this august House. I take this opportunity to  congratulate you.  Today, you are taking the dignified and high position of the  largest democracy of the world.  We extend you our good wishes on the behalf of  the NCP.   Many a times it happens that some complicated issues crop up in the  States then everyone looks up to you and the Parliament.    I hope that you will act  as an ideal parliamentarian and Speaker with the states in the next 5 years. I, on the behalf of my party, congratulate  you.  I hope that you will give all of us full opportunity to express our views so that  we could make a strong nation. I, on behalf of my party, my  party President and all the MPs of my party extend our heartfelt compliments to  you. Just now, we have witnessed that everyone of us has supported your  assumption of Office in a collaborative spirit in a bid to add glory to this House  and would take sincere endeavours to ensure that you continue to enjoy our  untrammelled support in whatever you undertake to do to take the nation to the  next level of progress. I would just request you not to give us less time on the basis  of our fewer number in the House.  I earnestly hope, the way Kota has enabled  umpteen number of students in making their mark, the same kind of spirit would be  reflected in your patterns of functioning in the House by doing a little bit to  maintain an enabling milieu. I congratulate you on assuming the high  Office of Speaker.  I hope that you will uphold the theory of separation of powers.  I would also like to remind you that you are the referee of this House, You will  protect our voice. On behalf of people of Punjab and  Shiromani Akali Dal, I would like to congratulate you.  The hon. Prime Minister  has beautifully explained your life.  You being a farmer, a social worker and  having spent 27 years in public life, are fully aware of the problems of the people.   You are connected to the grass root. I would request you, that the minorities,  regional parties and States with small numbers should be given more time so that  they can express their views because their problems may be bigger than other  bigger States. On behalf of RLP Party, people of  Rajasthan and youth of the country,  I congratulate you on being elected to the  highest office of the Parliament of the world's largest democracy.   It is a matter of  great honour  for Rajasthan.   As a constituent party of the ruling NDA, we will  always keep supporting the Government and hope that you will also protect the  small parties like us.  Together, we all will build a new country and fulfil the  dreams of the hon. Prime Minister. I associate myself with the  motion of thanks.  As the Prime Minister stated over here that his nature is simple  and his working style is such as will give benefit to not only the House, but I think,  to the whole country.  I would like and urge upon you to give opportunity in terms  of allotting time to representatives elected as independents. I take this opportunity to congratulate  you on being elected unanimously to this august body of Seventeenth Lok Sabha.   While it is a highly prestigious position, it can also be a crown of thorns.  I am sure  that you will be able to discharge your responsibilities in the House in the true  interest of the entire nation and to protect the interest of all Members irrespective  of their Party affiliation.  I assure you the whole-hearted support from my Party  and myself. On behalf of the people of my  Constituency, I extend heartiest congratulation to you.  I have been elected for the  second term as an independent candidate.  I should also get ample opportunity to  put my views in the House. Hon. Members, I have to inform the House  that Hon. President has nominated the following Members on the Panel of  Chairpersons:-  1.  Shri Kodikunnil Suresh  2.  Shri Brijbhushan Sharan Singh  3.  Shri  Bhartruhari  Mahtab  _______      OATH OR AFFIRMATION     The Speaker pro tem Dr. Virendra Kumar having already taken oath before  the President, signed the Roll of Members at the commencement of the sitting and  took his seat in the House.    Thereafter, 320 Members took the oath or made the affirmation, signed the  Roll of Members and took their seats in the House.      SNEHLATA About 2 crore small investors have been looted in  the country and money worth 4 lakh crore rupees is involved in that.  The  Government has decided to protect those small investors and the poor by bringing  this Bill.  The West Bengal Government had not enacted this legislation in the  State till 2015.  Now, when the Union Government is bringing this legislation, they  are protesting it just to cover up the Sharda Chit Fund Scam. On behalf of my Party, I  thank you and the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs for the five years that we have  spent together.  The Speaker\\u2019s Research Initiative has been one of the main  contributions in the last five years and helped all of us to make better speeches. I  congratulate the entire Speaker\\u2019s Office and the SRI for the contribution that they  have made.    I am in favour of this Bill.  The Standing  Committee had suggested some improvements in this Bill.  I would like the  Government to consider those issues so that the Bill can be complete in its totality. I came to this august House at age of 26.   The Hon. Speaker and Hon. Deputy Speaker both gave me ample opportunities to  speak in this House.  I thank you for this.   This Bill is aimed at tackling the menace  of taking deposit by luring people with the offer of attrac2tive returns.  The case in  point is Agri Gold and Akshaya Gold Scheme in Andhra Pradesh.  Through this  enactment  depositors  are  banned  from  promoting,  operating,  issuing  advertisements or accepting deposits in any unregulated deposit scheme.  The Bill  also contain penal provisions for attachment of properties for repayment to  depositors where such money is raised illegally.  The Bill offers clarity on the  nature of deposit scheme and classifies all deposit schemes. I am grateful to the Hon'ble  Minister of Home Affairs who took serious pains at his end to install the statue of  Shaheed Udham Singh at Jallianwala Bagh gate after 70 years sans being  subservient to the set of rules in place.  I would like to urge upon the Government  to confer Bharat Ratna on Shaheed Bhagat Singh.  I support the Jallianwala Bagh  National Memorial (Amendment) Bill, 2018 and compliment the Government for  this move.  At the same time, I would like to salute those martyrs and pay tribute to  them. I rise to express our gratitude from  the core of our heart.  The Sixteenth Lok Sabha was full of excitement, tensions,  anxiety, agitations, few good quality speeches, few unwanted and unexpected  economic decisions and many other activities.  You have been successful in  bringing the situation under control.  Your patience is remarkable and  praiseworthy.  You stood up for us and gave opportunity to us on many occasions.   I do not know what will happen after elections.  I always want that you stay in  good health.  I am of the opinion that personal attachment will certainly continue. Under the reservation on economic basis,  people earning less than Rs. 8 lakh may avail benefit of reservation. Income tax  exemption limit should be increased up to Rs. 8 lakh instead of Rs. 5 lakh. One  thing is good that if someone purchases two houses after selling old house, then he  will not be taxed on capital gains of more than two crore rupees. Benefits of the  Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana should be extended to the poor. Not only in rural  areas, there are many poor people in the cities also. Land of Mumbai Port Trust is  occupied by slums. There should be a policy for their redevelopment. We are  trying to outsource everything. We should come with a permanent solution, an  assured income. We are strangling PSUs. BSNL and MTNL took a loan of ten  thousand crore and since then they have been running in loss. Does the  Government have any policy which can strengthen them? PSU used to generate  employment. Today it is suffering losses and it is being said that they should be  given VRS. How can we generate employment then? We have come out with some  good schemes like Mudra loan but we should also check whether the schemes are  actually having an impact on the ground or not. How Ayushman Yojana and other  schemes will be extended to the poor, who will do it? It should be extended in a  way that when anyone having a BPL card goes directly to the hospital, he should  get free treatment under Ayushman Bharat. This is my suggestion. Do you know  why you do not have data on unemployment? In past, there used to be the Regional  Employment Exchanges. Data used to come from there. Overall, this Budget and  Finance Bill give the feeling of \\u2018Kabhi-Kabhi Khushi, Kabhi-Kabhi Gam.\\u201d The holistic, transparent and inclusive  budget will empower the poor, farmers and labourers as well as realize dreams of  the middle class society of the country.  It will also reward honest tax payers and  expedite pace of infrastructure development and economy of the country will make  a mark across the world.  The ten dimensions set for India\\u2019s vision 2030 to make  India a uniform and transparent and modern technology operated society with  higher growth rate.  Ambala Lok Sabha Constituency should be made an industrial  hub, HMT Pinjore should be revived and Baba Saheb Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar  Medical College or University be set up in Yamuna Nagar district.  Ambala and  Yamuna Nagar districts have potential to be developed as an industrial centre for  North India. This Budget has simply failed to address  even the fundamental NDA Government Mantra- \\\"Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas\\\".  In  terms of budgetary allocations for solving immediate issues like the problems  created by Demonetization, GST, national intolerance, slow economic growth,  NPAs, black money, corruption etc., this budget has done very little.  Empowering  our citizens should have been our top priority for sustaining the healthy growth of  democracy.  In this regard, the Union Government appears directionless. Toilets  are constructed everywhere but there is no proper water supply.  I urge upon the  Union Government to provide compulsorily a good school in every Indian village.  I also demand implementation of the Manipur Merger Agreement of 1949 in letter  and spirit; protection of the Territorial Integrity of Manipur at the time of merger  with Union of India; political solution of insurgency in Manipur, inscription of  the  erstwhile Manipur National Flag/Emblem in Parliament House; repeal of Armed  Forces  (Special)  Powers  Act  (AFSPA),  1958;  total  abolition  of  Restricted/Protected Area Permit (RAP/PAP) in Manipur; restoration of Permit  System for entry into and exit from Manipur as abolished in 1950; granting  Scheduled Tribe (ST) status of Meiteis/Meeteis; extension of financial assistance  to the Autonomous District Councils in Manipur; immediate withdrawal of the  Citizenship Amendment Bill 2016; full time functioning of Manipur National  Sports University; and development of infrastructures for sports, culture and  tourism, classical language status for Manipuri language; inclusion of Manipuri  scripts in currency notes; more all-weather National Highways (NHs) with NH-2  and NH-37 on top priority; setting up of dedicated NH protection security forces  for smooth flow of goods and passengers; early completion of National Project :  Jiribam-Tupul-Imphal Rail lines; dedicated in-built security arrangement for all  national projects in the Northeast; and to make Imphal International Airport fully  functional at International norms in order to meet the aspirations of the people of  Manipur. I support this interim  budget.  There are very good provisions in the budget proposals for farmers,  labourers and middle class.  In this budget, there are proposals  for annual income  support of Rs.6000 for small farmers, mega pension for labourers of unorganised  sectors, increase in income tax limit upto Rs.5 lakh for working class.  Standard  deduction has also been enhanced upto Rs.50,000 from Rs.40,000.  Proposal of  schemes like Rashtriya Kamdhenu Yojana for providing cheaper loan for animal  husbandry is a big relief.  A provision has been made under Pradhan Mantri Shram  Yogi Mandhan Yojana to provide monthly pension of Rs.3000 to labourers above  60 years.  Defence budget has been enhanced to more than three lakh crore rupees.  It is a development oriented interim budget.   The Budget for the year 2019-20 is one of  the most pro-farmer and pro-labour Budget.  The Central Government has set aside  Rs.75,000 crore to provide income support to marginal farmers in the country  under Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi.  The workers in the unorganized  sector with monthly income of upto Rs.15,000 will receive assured monthly  pension from the age of 60 years.  This Budget has also increased the threshold of  taxable income from Rs.2,50,00 per annum to Rs.5,00,000 which will benefit   crores of salaried workers. The Tourism Promotion Corporation  of India Bill has been introduced in the House. A single tourist provides job for the  35-36 persons the place of his visit in a direct or indirect manner. Tourism all over  the world contributes around 9 per cent in the global GDP. In India also the Modi  Government has taken some brilliant decisions such as Visas on-Arrivals, E-tourist  visas, development of different tourism circuits. I want to know from the  Government as to how many tourism sites are in India and what is the number of  their air, rail, road and water connectivity, separately.     Himachal Pradesh is famous for natural beauty, mountains, water, forests,  fields, apple gardens, ancient temples and other religious shrines. Place like  Bhakhra Dam and Dong Dams are famous for adventure sports. But these places  lack Shikaras, backwaters boats where they may stay. The state is also deficient in  adequate tourism facilities. Every year, over two crore tourists visit the state. The  state needs a big infrastructure such as highways or roadways.     In some of the religious places like the Golden Temple in Amritsar  commendable job has been done in the field of tourism. This has helped to raise  the number of tourists there five fold. The food recipes in Amritsar have become  popular all over the world. Can we do something to include Litti-Chokha of Bihar,  Dal-Bati Churma of Rajasthan, South Indian dishes like Idli-Dosha etc. in the food  items at our tourist centres to attract more tourists? Similarly music festival etc.  may be organised and the different cultures of India may be manifested thereform.     Mahatma Gandhi was able to learn India only when he toured the nation by  trains. We also muss endeavor to enable our youth go to every part of the country.  I request the Government to facilitate the new generation of country to have the  first hand idea of the nation through 'Vishwa-Darshan' or Bharat Darshan by  visiting there. They must be allowed to visit the army dwelling and working places  so that they may have an idea of the real life style of armed forces there.     Hon'ble Modi has managed to get approval of the UNO to observe 21 June  as Yoga Day. We must endeavour to provide jobs for more and more people by  promoting Yoga and Wellness-meditation spas.         The paintings by Shobha Singh in our state is popular all over the world.   But today it is battling for its existence. We could not protect the Rodriguez Art  Gallery where a great Russian painter lived and worked. We should try for a joint  venture with India-Russia culture centres. Can we do something to revive the  paintings of Shobha Singh?     In Andaman and Nicobar Islands, we have tribes, forests and one of the most  pristine beaches in the world. Moreover they are rich in corals and sea life. We  must make it a tourist hub by enabling all flights from Europe to land there before  going to Japan, Australia etc. We can create economy in Andaman and Nicobar  Islands more gigantic than Singapore.     I request all my colleagues to adopt this Bill whole heartedly. It will create  jobs for crores of Indians. Our state Himachal Pradesh will also be able to promote  tourism in many fields. It is a matter of great pleasure  for me that during the last four and half years, federal structure has been  strengthened.  Shares of States have been increased from 32 per cent to 42 per cent.   First time in the history of our country, hon. President has addressed peasants of  this country as Anna Data.  The Government has brought many schemes to double  the income of farmers. Similarly six crore people have been provided gas  connections.  98 per cent people having provided with toilet facilities.  Providing  houses to one crore 30 lakh people is also a commendable step.  Moreover, it is a  matter of immense pleasure for me that hon. President has mentioned about the  road to be built connecting Kartarpur.  This will facilitate the shrine visit and  also  improve the bilateral relations between the two countries.  During the last four and  half years not only we have been celebrating Prakash Utsav  of Gurunanak Dev ji  but we have also brought policies based on his sermons for the welfare of poor  people of the country.  This Government have also issued a commemorative coin  in the honor of Guru Gobind Singh Sahab.  I would like to request that Bharat  Ratna should be conferred to Shahid Bhagat Singh ji and Shahid Udham Singh ji. Hon. Member has made certain serious  comments on the functioning of the Joint Parliamentary Committee.  To bring it on  record, I want to say that we had tried our best to bring consensus.  Three  amendments were accepted unanimously but when consensus could not emerge on  certain amendments, we followed the practice of voting.    I rise to support the Citizenship  (Amendment) Bill, 2019.  I was a Member of the JPC on this Bill.  Is there any  political party which can say that it will not remain silent if there is any incident of  atrocities on Hindus in any part of the world.  In India, minorities means a  particular religion.  But when this Bill seeks to grant citizenship to the minorities  of Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, this bothers you.  Nehru-Liyakat pact  envisaged that the persons who had settled in either country on the basis of  religion, they would be protected.  Besides, there have been demographic changes  in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.  Today, this Bill is an attempt to correct the  mistakes which were committed at the time of partition.  This Bill seeks to grant  citizenship to the Hindus, Sikhs, Parsis, Jains and Buddhists who face religious  persecution in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan in order to correct that  mistake. \",\n          \"I would like to speak about Lord  Rama and the importance of the eternal teachings of Lord Rama. As depicted in the  Ramayana, his reign, termed as 'Ram Rajya' symbolized good governance, and  epitomised justice, welfare and happiness for all. The leadership of Lord Rama was  dedicated to fairness, compassion, and the welfare of his people above all else. The  Lord Venkateshwara Temple in my parliamentary constituency at Tirupati is one of  the most famous temples in our country. Anjanadri Hill, one of the seven Hills, is  supposed to be the birthplace of Hanuman. Another location Lepakshi is referenced  in the Ramaana which stands as a testament to the widespread reverence of Lord  Rama\\u2019s legacy.  By developing these sites, we will enhance India\\u2019s cultural heritage  tourism as well as reinforce the bonds of unity and spirituality inspired by Lord  Rama. We request the Government for comprehensive development and better  connectivity to all religious sites nationwide to further enrich our cultural heritage  and thereby strengthen the fabric of our society. I would like to express my gratitude to you  for giving me the opportunity to participate in the discussion on the Construction of  the Historic Shri Ram Temple and the consecration of Shri Ramlala. The name of  Ram is unforgettable to all of us on every occasion of life and the unveiling of the  idol of Ramlala and construction of the temple by our Hon. Prime Minister has been  a historic work. I request the Hon. Prime Minister that just as the Ram Mandir was  built in Ayodhya, similarly a grand temple should also be built at  Sitamarhi  in  Bihar, which is the birthplace of Maa Janaki. We were elected to the 17th Lok Sabha under  the leadership of the Hon'ble Prime Minister. Our name has been recorded in history  as we were the last Member in the old Parliament House and could become the voice  of the people of our constituency as the first Member in the new House. I come from  Sitamarhi, the birthplace of Mother Sita. I respectfully salute the people of Sitamarhi  for giving me the opportunity to raise the problems of my area and get the  Government to develop my area or solve their problems. I want to tell everyone in  the House that just as we have witnessed the abrogation of Article 370, passing laws  regarding triple talaq, women's reservation and construction of temples in the 17th  Lok Sabha, in the same way, we can witness the construction of grand temple of  Sitaji in the 18th Lok Sabha. Judgement on Ram Mandir has been  delivered by the Supreme Court and Ram Mandir has been built under its guidelines.  I just want to say one thing these tribal people of ours are physiolater. They also  want whether it is Sarna wala or Batwa wala, their religion should also get equal  respect. I would like the voices of those people to be heard as well. The history of  Shri Ram ji is related to us also because the tribals supported Him in the battle.  People think that Ram rajya is a dream kingdom where there will be justice, peace  and brotherhood. We hope that there will be justice, peace and tranquility in India in  the seeds of time.  When I entered into the 12th  Lok Sabha, I felt very happy. That was about 26 years back. It is the temple of  democracy. There are 140 crore people in this country and only 543 Members in this  House. I must appreciate our hon. Prime Minister has actually brought India into the  world map. We have worked like a family in this Parliament. The greatest  opportunity for this 17th Lok Sabha\\u2019s Members is the shift from the old Parliament  to the new Parliament. There is no Central Hall here. I request you once again to  create a Central Hall here. In these five years of the Lok Sabha period, the  Government has brought a lot of valuable Bills also. I must thank our hon. Prime  Minister for that. It was a good experience in the 17th Lok Sabha. I cannot forget this  in my lifetime. I actually compliment my colleagues and everybody. When we used  to meet outside the Parliament also generally, like a family we used to celebrate very  happily everything. Whenever certain communities want to  come into the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Order, it is always a welcome  move.  That is because, the facilities which were being denied to these people so far,  the facilities of reservation in education and jobs will be given to them now.  Many  youths would be benefited from this. Many more communities deserve a rightful place  in this Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Bill.  The Badaga community in the  Nilgiris has been asking to be included in the Scheduled Tribes list for a very, very  long time. Kurum barsand Lamb adis are there from my constituency.  Tamil Nadu  Government has sent a detailed report for inclusion of 13 Kurumbar communities in  the Scheduled Tribes list. We urge upon the Government to include these 13  communities and also the Lambadi community and other communities at the earliest.   DMK has always been a voice of the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and of  the minorities.  We have done a lot for these people and we are very proud of doing  this.   This Bill has been piloted to give tribal status  to some communities of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. My demand is that there should  be a JPC for all these communities. There is a Rajvanshi community in our country  which has been given the status of Scheduled Caste in West Bengal, Scheduled Tribe  in Meghalaya and Other Backward Class in Assam. Munda people in Assam have not  got status of Scheduled Tribe, Oraon and Kurmi have not got status of Scheduled  Tribe. Similar demand has been placed by the Ahom community also. Goriya  Muslims, Desi Muslims and Kalita community are also demanding the status of  Scheduled Tribe. A Joint Parliamentary Committee should be constituted and all the  communities demanding Scheduled Tribe status should be covered en bloc. This  should not be seen from the perspective of political milestones. The Budget allocated  for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes should also be increased. Constitutional amendments are being made  by our Government with respect to different States under which various tribes are  being included to provide reservation. My request is that a comprehensive Bill should  be brought for the entire country. Dhangar is called Dhangarh in other states except  Maharashtra, although both of these names belong to the same caste. For this reason,  Dhangar has not been included in the Scheduled Tribe list in Maharashtra and has  been given OBC status in the central list. 45 tribes of Dhangars are in Maharashtra,  but information related to their population is not available. The development of these  tribes will be considered as per the caste-based census. The present Government has  proposed the constitution of committees only to discuss this issue from time to time.  Today our Government is in power both at the Center and in Maharashtra and in such  a situation justice should be given properly. Dhangar should definitely come within  four Lok Sabha seats out of 48. Dhangar society has had a history. Ahilyabai Holkor ji  was the queen in the 18th century, who worked for her society. Today, Dhangar  community has been demanding a place from the Government of Maharashtra for  many years to build a memorial of Ahilyabai Holkar in Jalna district. Muslims also  constitute a sizable population of the counrty and they should also be given justice..  They should also be provided with reservation. I welcome the Water (Prevention and  Control of Pollution) Amendment Bill, 2024 on behalf of my Party. But at the same  time, I have a few suggestions to offer.. A recent RTI reply revealed that no penalties  have been collected under the Water Act for two years from 2020 to 2022 in Kerala.  This raises concern about the state of enforcement and monitoring of the Pollution  Control Boards in the country. As per the amendments, crediting of penalties to EPF  is a step in the right direction. However, efforts must be made to ensure funds are  efficiently utilised. A three-tier model can be used to access the penalty amount which  considers the history of violation, unlawful gains from the act of pollution, and  pollution clean-up cost for calculating the penalty. Moreover, the Government  officials imposing penalties should be at least in the rank of Joint Secretary to the  State Government or the Central Government. At the same time, if aggrieved parties  approach the NGT, then the justice should be ensured to be delivered within a  prescribed time-frame. Sharing of data and coordination between bodies responsible  for addressing groundwater pollution, such as State Government departments,  Pollution Control Boards and agencies, such as CGWA must be encouraged. While  we are talking about prevention of pollution or checking pollution of water and  environment, we must also talk about saving water. As it is known that the main objective of  the Water Pollution Prevention and Control (Amendment) Bill, 2024 is to first control  the increasing water pollution in the entire country by strengthening the law already  made in Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Union Territories to prevent water  pollution. Flood in the Rapti River in my Parliamentary Constituency, Shravasti, not  only causes water pollution in Sravasti, Rampur, Siddharthnagar, Gorakhpur as well  as other districts, but also unleashes huge loss of life and property to the people here.  Therefore, high dams should be constructed on both of the banks of this river. This  will also help in stemming the spread of water-borne diseases.  laid a statement regarding the need to set up a food  plaza processing industry in Mumbai-North Parliamentary Constituency,  Maharashtra.  (2) laid a statement regarding construction of  overbridge on Hapur- Khurja railway line in Hapur City, Uttar Pradesh.  (5) This budget embodies our unwavering  commitment to fiscal prudence, economic growth, and inclusive development.  The  government aims for a nominal GDP growth rate of 10.5% in 2024-25. We have set  targeted deficits, with a revenue deficit of 2% of GDP which will ensure long-term  economic stability. Our Government is committed to transforming the railway sector  by implementing three major economic railway corridor programs. In the housing  sector, we aim to build an additional two crore houses over the next five years. In the  energy sector, we will undertake rooftop solarization of one crore households and we  have mandated the blending of compressed biogas in CNG and PNG. Under the Nal  Se Jal mission, we are committed to providing pure tap water connections to 75% of  rural households, prioritizing access to clean drinking water for all. Our government's  reform initiatives include decentralization of governance and the promotion of  inclusive development. In the realm of education and healthcare, our commitment is  evident through the establishment of prestigious institutions and the expansion of  medical education capacity. The rail track to Kashmir is going to be completed by  2024. Security remains a top priority with zero tolerance toward terrorism.Investment  in road and transportation infrastructure is increasing The Eklavya Model Schools and  Stand Up India program are empowering marginalized communities and fostering  inclusive growth. The surge in tourism and foreign arrivals in Jammu Kashmir is a  testament to the region's allure and economic viability. So we can say that our budget  allocation reflects our unwavering commitment to fostering growth, stability, and  prosperity. laid a statement regarding the need to lift ban  on export of soyabean and cotton.  (15) I thank the Hon'ble Prime Minister for  conferring Bharat Ratna on Jannayak Karpoori Thakur ji  and Shri Lal Krishna  Advani Ji. Shri Karpoori Thakur ji implemented reservation for the backwards. Bihar  should be given the status of a special category state. The special package given for  Bihar is also not very encouraging. The Central government should run a scheme for  providing a monthly pension of Rs. 1500 to all persons above the age of 60 years.  Youth should be given employment at the local level. Premium for crop insurance  schemes may be rationalised. Purnea Airport needs to be made operational at the  earliest.  There is a need to pay attention to the efficiency of nano urea and nano DAP  in the country as these failed to inspire confidence among farmers. The Patna Metro  Rail Project should be completed at the earliest. The funds should be provided to  complete the projects started in four selected smart cities of Bihar. A tax relief given  on income up to Rs 7 lakh is a welcome step. laid a statement regarding opening of  Model Schools in Berhampur, Odisha.  (17) I compliment the Hon\\u2019ble  Finance Minister for all the efforts that she has made. I have a few suggestions for  improvement in the larger interest of the nation. The Government maintains that it is  the Government of farmers. Ban on the export of onions leaves the worst impact on  the farmer It has been for the first time in history ban has been imposed by the               Government of the day on the export of farmers\\u2019 produce.  Lift ban on the export of  Onions. The Government keeps on claiming that the income of the farmers has been  doubled. But what is the data to prove it? The farmers of Maharashtra are in trouble  today. There is no water in many places. Wherever the farmers are in distress in  Maharashtra and in the country, their loans should be waived. The Government says  that it is a Government of the poor. If the government has eradicated poverty, then  why is the number of people being provided food grains i.e. 80 crore is not on the  decline? It is fraught with contradictions. So, this is something the Government owes  us an answer thereto. There are more than 50 crore accounts under Jan DhanYojana.  Most of them are operated by the females. Public sector Banks are cloaking profits.  Why does the Bank need so much profit? If this is a government of the poor, then  increase the interest rate on the money deposited by the poor in their Jan Dhan  Accounts. More than 22 crore youth have applied for 7.5 lakh jobs.Unemployment is  one of the biggest challenges. The government is doing so much for the youth, but  jobs are not being created for them. Artificial intelligence is going to happen.It is  going to disrupt our lives. Jobs are going to change. It is because technology has  changed our lives. So, what is this Government\\u2019s plan for unemployment? The  government says so much about the Ujjwala scheme, but the refills are not more than  50%.People cannot afford it.  If the government wants to do something for women,  then increase the wages of Anganwadi and Asha workers, make them permanent and  also give them pensions. Today, there are many senior citizens in EPS-95, who are not  getting money. Where did the money of EPS - 95 go? There is no improvement in the  country in terms of corruption index. There is no clarity in the policy of this  Government for crypto currency. Four engines of growth, private consumption,  private investment, exports, etc., are not doing well.  The Government talks about  cooperative federalism.  As far as the devolution of tax is concerned, the Fifteenth  Finance Commission has said that it should be 41 per cent. Now it is only 30 and 35  percent. The State Governments are asking for 50 per cent.  Where is this cess and  surcharge going?  Capital expenditure is ballooning every year.  I am not against  infrastructure.  But, if this economy has to do better, it has to be not only an  infrastructure but every vertical should be included. I request this Government that if  it keeps putting money into infrastructure and only into Government expenditure, it is  not a sustainable model. We have a lot of hope from  this Government. Injustice has been meted out historically to Punjab. We have  sacrificed a lot for this country. So, our demands should be kindly met. In 1966, the  Punjab Reorganization Act was passed. We were promised the capital city of  Chandigarh. But we have not been provided the sole right of Chandigarh as our  capital. A historical injustice has been done to us. So, justice must be provided to us.  Chandigarh is our capital. Punjabi language should be made mandatory in the city.  The officers of Chandigarh should be taken based on the ratio of 60:40 in favour of  Punjab. But the Government has tinkered with this rule. Punjab is the only State  which does not have its capital city. It has no rights over its river waters. Congress  party had done a grave injustice to Punjab and gave our river water to Rajasthan. The  riparian principles were not followed whereby the first right of river water lies with  Punjab. In BBMB, our member was there. The laws were changed and there is no  member of Punjab in the Board and members from outside have been brought to fill  the seats in BBMB. 21,000 acres worth of land in our border belt lies beyond the  barbed wire fence. The farmers have to cultivate this land with great difficulty. So, I  urge upon the Government to grant compensation packages to these border farmers, as  was done during the time of Vajpayee ji and Badal ji.  Please open our border with  Pakistan for trade so that Punjab too can prosper again. Border districts of Punjab  should be given the status of 'Backward district' and special packages and grants  should be given to these districts. Ever since changes in quota rules have come up, the  number of Sikh and Punjabi soldiers has been reduced in the army. The number of  Punjabis and Sikhs is getting reduced in Punjab and Haryana High Court too. I  congratulate the Government that the consecration of Ram Mandir has been done. We  ask for the welfare of all humanity. We too should be allowed to visit our religious  sites. Gyan Godi in Haridwar, Dangwal Sahib in Sikkim and Mangu Math in Odisha  are our religious places. Our first Guru Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji had visited these  places. These religious places of ours were snatched away from us. These places must  be returned to us so that we can worship there. Haryana disbanded our SGPC and  constituted its own organization against the Central Act. The original SGPC must be  restored in Haryana. The Maharashtra Government has removed our member of Shri  Hazur Sahib in Nanded Sahib and is including its members there. This is wrong. In the  end, let me say that our National Health Mission funds are there. We have no hopes  from the Punjab Government and Congress party. We urge upon the Central  Government to help us. The Anganwadi workers in Punjab get only Rs.2200 and  Rs.2400. Their honorarium should be increased. We need a PGI Satellite Centre at  Khadoor Sahib. A 300-bed trauma centre is needed at AIIMS. For farmers,  Swaminathan Commission recommendations must be implemented.   There has been a big change in the  Indian economy in the last 10 years. Today, we are the fifth-largest economy in the  world. The Government is working to develop Badnera railway station as a world- class station by 2025 and Amravati railway station by 2027. I request to start a Vande  Bharat train from Amravati to Mumbai. The Government has allocated and released  about Rs. 800 crore for the Badnera wagon railway factory in Amravati. The condition  of farmers who are cultivating cotton, soybean, tur, gram, moong, orange, etc., is very  poor. Therefore, the Government needs to increase the Kisan Samman Nidhi from Rs.  6000 to 12000. PM Awas Yojana should get equal funds for both rural and urban,  whereas currently Rs 1.20 lakh in rural and Rs 2.50 lakh in urban are being provided.  A Government Medical College is going to be set up in my Parliamentary  constituency Amravati. ASHA volunteers should get Rs 7,000 and group promoters  Rs. 6,200 and Rs. 2,000 on the occasion of Diwali. The Government has trained 9  crore women in the field of women empowerment. I thank the Government for Belora  Airport at Amravati. The Government has provided Rs. 2200 crores for 14 talukas of  Amravati and also provided Eklavya Model School in the tribal-dominated part of  Dharani taluka. With the establishment of the Shri Ram temple, India's fame has  increased globally. The Maharashtra government has given justice to the Maratha  society by securing the OBC reservation. Allocating capital for the  growth of Central Agricultural Universities is essential. Therefore, I would urge the  Central Government to support the setting up of a Central Agricultural University for  the benefit of the farmers of Andhra Pradesh. As we are giving representation to  women in legislative bodies, also I would like to mention that in Andhra Pradesh, 688  out of 1356 politically nominated persons are women. I would also request the  Government to set up modern world-class fish harbours across the country, just like  Andhra Pradesh. One more point that I would like to make is that Andhra Pradesh  urgently requires greater fiscal space for development activities. Due to an ill- conceived bifurcation plan, it becomes the responsibility of the Central Government to  compensate for the losses suffered by the Successor State. I urge the Government to  formulate and implement a time-bound plan for granting special category status to  Andhra Pradesh. I congratulate the Government for the  grand Ram temple built in Ayodhya. There are many religious places in Azamgarh  between Ayodhya and Varanasi, such as Durvasa Rishi Dham, Dattatreya Rishi  Dham, Chandrma Rishi Dham etc. located on the banks of river Tamsa and the Charan  Paduka place of Guru Nanak Dev Ji in Nizamabad and Palhana Dham of Lalganj,  which is Shaktipeeth. All these are places of mythological importance must be  developed and connected to the Ayodhya circuit, foreign tourists will also visit  Azamgarh situated in the middle of Varanasi, Ayodhya and Gorakhnath Temple and  there is a possibility of developing of better tourism sector also. This will provide  employment as well as economic benefits to the State. Mahavikas Pradhikaran scheme  must be implemented in Azamgarh. The work of laying tap water lines, sewer lines  and gas pipelines must be done simultaneously so that the villagers do not have to face  a lot of trouble due to the frequent digging of village roads. There have been arenas of  famous wrestlers in all five assembly constituencies of the Lalganj region. There is a  need for a modern auditorium or mini stadium for wrestling at these places. These  wrestlers must be encouraged. Red chilli cultivation takes place on a large scale in the  Phulpur assembly of Lalganj. Red chilli cultivation must be promoted here by  establishing a training and processing institute, as there is immense potential for  employment opportunities in this area. Under the One District One Product, means for  import and export of black pottery from my area should be provided and a market  should also be provided for the same. From the Shahi bridge to Belwai, 40 kilometres  away in Azamgarh district, which connects three assembly constituencies - Sadar,  Nizamabad, and Phulpur, the condition of the road is extremely dilapidated. The  Government should complete the work of constructing these major roads at the  earliest. Stoppage of mail trains at Fariha railway station between Mau and Shahganj  must be provided and construction of a flyover bridge at gate number 40 along with  level crossing number 41 should be carried out. The budget for a direct rail line from  Azamgarh to Gorakhpur via Varanasi and Lalganj has also been allocated in the year  2022-23. A railway line should be laid via Lalganj and a station in Lalganj must be  built. Lakhs of unemployed people have got jobs, but most of the jobs have been filled  through outsourcing. Lakhs of posts are vacant in various departments, which must be  filled as soon as possible through the backlog. Due to one-time fees being collected by  the Government, many children are unable to take admission and more than half of the  seats are lying vacant in all the educational institutions. It is requested to allow  admission on zero balance so that lakhs of children can be admitted to technical  education. The amount of funds given under PM Awas Yojana must be increased to  Rs 5 lakh in view of inflation because the rates of soil, sand, bricks, cement and iron  have doubled in the last 5 years. The Old Pension Scheme must be implemented once  again. The Government should increase the amount of Kisan Samman Nidhi to Rs 6  thousand per instalment. Instead of limiting Ayushman Yojana only to families of 6  members, this benefit should also be given to those having 5 or 4 family members.  The Government has accepted my demand to implement the Mahavikas Pradhikaran  Scheme in Azamgarh, I thank the Government for it. Due to railway expansion, access  roads to many villages have been closed, the Government is requested to introduce  certain schemes so that such problems can be dealt with. Due to the economic policies of this  Government in the last 10 years, today the country is moving fast in the world, which  has brought change in everyone's life.  Indore has reached number one in cleanliness,  Ayushman card, smart city, air quality index, ABHA card health checkup etc. Indore  has been developing fast in the last five years in terms of connectivity and  infrastructure, rail, road, air connectivity, logistics hub, Textile Park etc. I want to  inform the Government that it is time for Artificial Intelligence, so an Innovation Lab  for Artificial Intelligence should be set up in Indore. Allocations for water supply, power,  forestry and wildlife, medical and public health, social welfare and road transport have  been reduced in the Budget.  The unexplored potential of Andaman and Nicobar  Islands can happen if the Central Government increases the Budget of Andaman and  Nicobar Islands from Rs. 5866 crores to Rs. 25000 crores as a one-time investment to  develop infrastructure.  I request the Government to kindly consider the following  demands to boost the economy of Andaman and Nicobar Islands: To fill up vacant  posts and create more jobs to promote tourism.  Introduce a 90 per cent transport  subsidy.  Construct Ship Building and Ship repairing dry dock in Islands.  To start  boat service from Phongi Balu to Hut Bay.  Need to establish a Legislative Assembly  for Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  Creation of Andaman and Nicobar Public Service  Commission.  Construction of bridges from Chattam to Bamboo Flat and Minni Bay  to Mithakhari.  Start air connectivity from Port Blair to Madurai, Port Blair to Kochi,  Port Blair to Ranchi and vice-versa.  Increase the salary of Anganwadi and Asha  workers.  Regularize the service of all contract and casual workers.  To provide  Unemployment Allowance of Rs. 5000.  Install desalination plants at different  Islands.  Need to establish a Central University in Andaman and Nicobar  Islands.  Establishing a separate commission for women in Andaman and Nicobar  Islands.  Resume flight service from Port Blair to Car Nicobar.  Installation of new  LPG bottling plant at Mayabunder.  Start PG Courses in Medical College.  All India  Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) in Andaman.  Air Ambulance for transporting  serious patients from remote Islands to Port Blair.  Construct stadiums at Diglipur,  Port Blair and Car Nicobar.  Construction of Snake Park at Kadamtala.  Construction  of Crocodile Park at Bakuntala.  Construction of the world\\u2019s biggest underwater  aquarium at Hot Bay etc. The Interim Budget overlooked rising  unemployment, rising inflation, and deepening economic slowdown, the farmer and  the middle-class people. I demand that a medical college should be set up at Shravasti.  I also demand that a government college and a technical college should be opened in  the Shravasti and Balrampur districts. In my Constituency, 6 development blocks of  both districts touch the Indo-Indo-Nepal border. A separate provision should be made  in the Interim Budget for barricading and high mast lights for security in villages  located in the forest along the border. The honorarium of Anganwadi workers should  be increased to Rs 15,000, and that of ASHA to Rs 2,500. Farmers should be given  subsidies on petrol and diesel. Kisan Samman Nidhi should be increased to Rs 18,000.  Free electricity should be provided to farmers for tubewell connections. There is a  need to conduct a caste census in the country. This is a much-needed law and was  much awaited by crores of youths who have suffered due to paper leaks, especially  in job recruitment. It can be said that this law would deter further leaks, as a  specific law to punish the wrongdoers. There are a few positive things in this Bill  which I would like to point out.  The Bill is designed to increase the transparency,  fairness, and credibility of public examination systems. The Bill serves as a model  draft for States, offering them the discretion to adopt its provisions. The Bill deters  against unfair practices. Here are some suggestions from my Party. Why is a  candidate given immunity from the Bill if he indulges in malpractices that lead to  the examination process being vitiated? I would be happy if the Hon. Minister  could clarify this limitation of the functioning of the Bill if the candidate is a  wrongdoer. The Bill's implementation might require significant financial and  human resources, raising concerns about its practicality and effectiveness,  especially in rural or resource-limited settings. Has the hon. Minister made a plan  to ensure that such limitations of resources do not limit the effectiveness of the  Bill. In conclusion, The Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Bill, of  2024 represents a pivotal stride towards ensuring integrity and fairness in public  examination systems. However, the Bill does raise certain concerns that merit  further clarification and planning. With the right measures and continued  oversight, this Bill has the potential to significantly enhance the credibility of our  public examination systems, fostering a more just and merit-based society. With  these suggestions and comments, I support the Bill on behalf of my YSR Congress  Party. I support ' The Public Examinations  (Prevention of Unfair Means) Bill, 2024' and sympathise with each and every  candidate who suffered from the cancelled examinations. In the past, various  exams of many states like Haryana, Bihar, Gujarat, Rajasthan etc. have been  cancelled due to question paper leaks. According to newspaper reports, more than  1.4 crore candidates have been affected by paper leaks from 2016 to 2023. I  demand from the government that if the examination is cancelled due to any  reason, then the fees charged by the candidates should also be refunded. Today we  live in a society where the pressure to succeed in examinations is very high, which  is often driven by the severe consequence of unemployment and underemployment  in the private sectors prevailing in the country. This worrying trend speaks  volumes about the systemic failures affecting our education system. The Bill fails  to adequately address this aspect. Examinations are cancelled due to cheating and  malpractice and this result in an increase in unemployment. I would request the  Government to run a special campaign to fill lakhs of vacant posts in the Central  Government and state governments so that unemployment can be reduced. At the  same time, the penal system for copying and misconduct should be made more  stringent. I request you to omit various derogatory words  used for the Valmiki community of Jammu and Kashmir. My most important  demand is that we are not able to function within the limit of 50 per cent laid down  in the Constitution. Therefore, I request that if the Government can raise the limit  of 50 per cent, it would be a very good thing. laid a statement regarding the need  to upgrade State Highways No. 26 and 02 as National Highways in  Rajasthan.  laid a statement regarding shifting of  Railway godown adjacent to railway station in Deoria district headquarters to  the area near Ahilyapur railway station in Deoria District.  (11) laid a statement regarding the need to construct a Ring  Road in Samastipur, Bihar.  (21) laid a statement regarding  establishment of a Circuit bench of Odisha High Court, and set up Indian  Mediation Center in Bhawanipatna, Kalahandi district, Odisha.  (25) First of all, on behalf of Bihar and the  entire people of Bihar, I express my gratitude to the Hon\\u2019ble Prime Minister for  honouring Jannayak Karpoori Thakur Ji with Bharat Ratna. If special financial  assistance is given to Bihar by the Government of India, then there will be all- round development of Bihar. I request the Government to make rules and give  reservation in outsourcing jobs also so that SC/ST and OBC can be promoted faster  and they can join the mainstream of society. According to IMF data, India's GDP is  3.7 trillion US dollars and it ranks fifth in the world. To meet the Sustainable  Development Goals of the United Nations, the Government of India has set a target  of eliminating extreme poverty by the year 2030. But it is expected that this goal  will be accomplished before that. My suggestion is to increase female labour force  participation, as it is currently very low. If we provide work opportunities to  women, then according to the World Bank's estimate, India can grow by 1.5  percentage points. The increasing number of kidney diseases in  many villages of  Odisha has created panic in the region but  there is no    response from the State Government. A serious investigation   into the  matter  in all those areas and its eradication is the need of the  hour.  Hence, I request  the hon. Union Health Minister through you to  kindly  call for a report from  the State Government, send a team of  experts to  visit the affected areas and    take necessary steps for the treatment of the  patients in specialized hospitals like AIIMS at Government cost.   Nowadays, an advertisement of a  spice manufacturing company shows a disappointed Army officer  running around a table like a clown with a gun in his hand to harm his  servant. It is not appropriate to make a mockery of Army officers in any  advertisement. Hence, I request you to take necessary action to ban  such  advertisements.  Life of Mata Savitribai Phule has  been a source of inspiration for  women residing in the villages and towns   of Maharashtra for many decades. She has played an important role in  creating educational awareness among  women in  society. Hence, I urge  upon the Government to declare the birth anniversary of Savitribai Phule,  that is, 3rd January as women teacher\\u2019s day.     My district Araria is surrounded  by rivers and every year floods cause loss of crops and property in the  district.  The Union  Government had sanctioned the Kosi\\u00adMechi  Interlinking Project but this project has not yet  been implemented.  Hence, I urge upon the Government to release the amount allocated for  Kosi\\u00adMechi Interlinking Project so that the problem of irrigation can also  be solved.   There is a need to provide adequate medical  facilities/ Centres in metropolitan cities and rural areas in view of Corona  Pandemic. Citizens residing in  300 sq. ft. houses in metropolitans should  be provided an identity card for availing  medical facilities in private  medical clinics and their cost of treatment for 3\\u00ad4 days running in lakhs   should be restricted to thousands of rupees and remaining  amount should  be borne by the  Central and State Government. Private clinics charge   lakhs of  rupees for  treatment for 3\\u00ad4 days. There is a need to establish a  monitoring mechanism at the Central level to stop this practice.   At present,  Raxaul Airport in East  Champaran district of North Bihar is non\\u00adoperational. The PM package of  Bihar in 2015 included Rs. 250 crore for the revival of Raxaul airport  which is still pending due to 121 acres of additional land required for the  development of the airport from the State Government. Revival of this 60  years old airport would curtail  the distance from Raxaul to Patna, New  Delhi and to  other important cities. I urge upon the Government to make   Raxaul Airport operational at the earliest.   My Parliamentary Constituency  Salempur has thousands of acres of waste land. Provision of solar plant  by Government on this land or authorizing a private sector company for  installation of solar plant on this land will lead to better utilization of this  land for green energy. Farmers are also willing to provide their land to the  Government and a solar plant on this land will provide employment to  youth. Hence, I urge upon the Central Government through you to  establish a solar power production centre in Mhal Manjharia of Lar block  in Salempur with central assistance.   Thanks to the passion for sports in this country, we  won several medals in the last Olympics. But where do these drugs or dopes  come from? It is very unfortunate that the players of India, which is known for  yoga and ayurveda, need to take drugs. We need good coaches and good  counsellors who can inculcate the passion in these players to do well in sports. I  support this Bill. The children of the village & toil day and night, practice  running on the highways, but after that when they come to the city to prepare  for the future, they find that due to doping, the urban boys are doing better than  them. It is a very sad thing. The world of anti\\u00addoping is extremely dynamic and  has to deal with new banned substances and processes from time to time. At  present there is only one National Dope Testing Laboratory in our country. I  would request the Hon'ble Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports to set up more  national doping laboratories to check doping. Heavy rainfall in forest areas of Gariaband  district under Mahasamund Parliamentary Constituency led to flood in  Pairi river on 13 July, 2022 and temporary embankment built near Kopara  village was destroyed. Flood water entered village Kopara, Tarra and  Kuruskera and Sursa dam which completely destroyed paddy crops  in  nearly 500 acres of farmland. There is an urgent need to build the above  embankment otherwise 1000 acre agricultural land will be destroyed. It is  requested to provide compensation under RBC after making  an  assessment of damaged crops  by an investigating team.    There is poor rail connectivity between  Delhi and Baran which is causing severe inconvenience to the passengers.  There has been a long\\u00adpending  demand from the people of Baran District  for the extension of the New Delhi\\u00adSogaria Express from Sogaria to the  Baran station. This connection will help them commute to districts of  Bundi, Sawai Madhopur, Karouli, Bharatput, Mathura and Delhi. Hence,  I request the hon. Minister to extend the Sogaria Express to the Baran  Railway station.  Plans are on the anvil for  improving and expanding  transport network of Mumbai Metro system of  450 kms is to be constructed under MMR. Corridor No. M\\u00ad13 from  Shivaji Chowk (Mira Road) to Vihar (DPR UP) covering the stretch of 23  kms  is to be constructed to link Vasai\\u00adVirar Corporation area. This is  likely to be operational by 2031. The local trains are unable to cope  with  the increasing number of passengers. Only early construction of Metro  Corridor No. M\\u00ad13 could solve the problem to some extent. I request the  Government for early construction of Metro Corridor No. M\\u00ad13.   MNREGS funds for the Odisha  State, Rs. 1195.58 crore towards material and admin component for first  quarter of financial year 2022\\u00ad23 in addition to the previous year\\u2019s  liability of Rs. 480.82 crore is yet to be cleared by the Ministry of Rural  Development. The livelihood of lakhs of workers from rural areas  depends on the wages released by the Central Government and hence, any  delays must be avoided. Moreover, delays in payments to suppliers and  contractors could disrupt progress of future projects due to erosion of  trust. The State has already requested the Union Government to release   funds to Odisha. Hence, I urge upon  the hon. Minister to immediately  pay heed to this problem and release the funds to Odisha.   Annual intake in class 6 of  Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas located in Shrawasti and Balrampur  districts of   my Parliament Constituency should be 80 but due to  inadequate hostel facility in these Schools, only 40 new students are  admitted  every year. I request the hon. Minister of education to provide  adequate hostel facilities in these schools so that 80 new admissions can  be taken every year. At the same time, Kendriya Vidyalayas at Shrawasti  and Balrampur are facing shortage of teachers and other staff leading to  the sufferings faced by the students. Number of teachers and other staff  should be increased in these schools.  When Government of  Andhra Pradesh uses surplus water going waste into sea, Krishna River  Management Board (KRMB) includes such water in AP\\u2019s account. The  recommendations of the Technical Committee of CWC, say that flood  water going waste into sea should not be included in the State quota.  Secondly, Bachavat Tribunal has given liberty to AP to use flood water as  it wishes. So, there is no justification behind KRMB including flood  waters, otherwise going waste into sea from Prakasam Barrage, in AP\\u2019s  account. I request the hon. Prime Minister to intervene and see that AP  uses surplus flood water. This is a commendable step taken by  the government to prevent doping in the country's sports and to set up a  National Anti\\u00adDoping Agency, which I heartily welcome. With this bill, the  system of sports in the country will become stricter and stronger, from which it  is not going to be easy for the athletes to escape. The aim of this Bill is to give  legal form to the operation of the National Anti\\u00adDoping Agency and its related  testing laboratories. The bill, inter alia, seeks to establish a national board for  anti\\u00addoping work in sports. With this, the work of making sports dope free in  India is being done by the Government, which is a welcome step. Due to lack of  law against doping in the country, the cases were reaching the court of law after  hearing in NADA. After the enactment of this law, the decisions of the NADA  hearing panel will not be challenged in the court. I have some suggestions. In  case an athlete does not follow a strict anti\\u00addoping law, the athlete as well as the  federation and the coach concerned should be held responsible. Players need to  be trained to strictly follow anti\\u00addoping laws. Dieticians should keep an eye on  the prescribed diet and there is also a need to test the food of the players. There  is a need to start more dope testing laboratories in the country. The  Parliamentary Standing Committee has also said in its suggestion that there  should be a laboratory in every state. My request to the Minister is to start a  laboratory in Mumbai, which will also meet the needs of the country and in  addition, India will become a leading country in Southeast Asia in the field of  anti\\u00addoping science and education. I support this bill. It has taken 20 years to frame this Bill  and bring it to the Parliament. The existing anti\\u00addoping rules were adopted by  NADA verbatim without taking into consideration the realities on the ground in  India. The Bill formulates these rules into a legislative framework. This  framework is welcome and crucial in the contemporary situation to protect the  athletes\\u2019 rights and regulate them. However, the Bill empowers the agencies to  act on their own belief to suspect any athlete. This creates an unreasonable  arbitrary authority in the hands of agency members to undertake to enter athlete  premises, seize any equipment, device or substance. The Bill does not provide  any clarity on the protection of the data they procure from the testing or  investigating the athlete. Also the personal data protection is missing and that is  one of the major reasons why one feels that this Bill has overlooked that issue.  Many of our sportspersons come from backward regions and they inadvertently  fall victims to doping which needs to be checked. One Hon\\u2019ble Member  mentioned about the Standing Committee Reports. I would say that certain  things are still lacking. The Committee also noted that the Bill does not make  any distinction between minor and major athletes and it should therefore be  made in the Rules to ensure the protective mechanism for minor athletes. The  Committee recommended that since an athlete\\u2019s sporting career is limited, there  is a need to ensure that the quantum of penalties is proportional to the degree of  the violation. Since this is a policy decision, the Government has to take note of  this and can examine this issue. The qualification of the Director General is not  specified. Leaving these provisions to the discretion of the Central Government  may affect the independence of the Director General. My second point is, under  the Bill the Board has powers to remove the members of the Disciplinary Panel  and Appeal Panel on grounds which are not specified in the Bill. The  Disciplinary Panel will consist of one Chairperson, four Vice\\u00adChairperson, and  ten members. But it is not clear who among the four Vice\\u00adchairpersons will be  responsible for forming the hearing panel in the absence of the Chairperson and  who will make that selection. I would say that when an athlete decides to use  illegal substances, he or she is not necessarily acting alone. Coaches are under  pressure to produce high results. Younger athletes find it difficult to resist it.  But the athletes are the ones who are punished and the coaches will go scot free.  Therefore, some provisions in the rules can be made in this regard. I support this  Bill. It was a good step that the Anti\\u00adDoping Bill  was sent to the Standing Committee, it was scrutinized there and the matter  moved on. The only thing I want to say is that the head of NADA, no matter  what name you give it, will not work properly unless the Government makes it  independent and autonomous. The Government should make an independent  officer the Director General and put the condition that after being appointed to  this post, one does not have to accept any other post. Laboratories, scientists,  equipment and doctors, all these should be well\\u00adequipped and as per NADA  standards. If this does not happen, then as NADA has been suspended many  times, in the same way, it will continue to be suspended again and again. I  would like to request the hon. Minister to make the officers of NADA such that  they are independent and can act freely, without any discrimination, bias, and  pressure. I would like to say that such athletes, who have inadvertently taken  any medicine for any reason, should be protected by NADA and also by the  Government. There was a time when India got more medals in Shooting in  international sports events than the total number of medals received in all other  games events. It's not so now. Nowadays, sports codes are being flouted. Even  after writing so many letters regarding sports to the Ministry of Sports, they do  not respond to any letter and do not take any action. I would request the  Ministry of Sports to rectify the mistakes that are being made. I am supporting  the Bill, but the loopholes in the Bill should be removed. It is said that doping happens only in athletes  whereas it is not so. Doping happens in every sport today. I want you to make  this Bill so effective that no one can touch our children anywhere in the  Olympic and Asian Games in case of doping. I have to say how our  Performance in football is getting worse. The football team should have also  been sent to the Asian Games.The Government should take such steps so that in  the next 10 years there would be no doping cases  and our children will get  more gold, more silver medals. Even after being included in the NCR region,         Bulandshahr district is still far behind in development as compared to         other districts. Due to the absence of ring road in Bulandshahr, the city is    facing the problems of traffic jams for a long time. In the year 2016, the     Union    Road  and  Transport  Minister  had  announced  the          construction of   Ring Road in the district. After getting the no\\u00ad   objection from the state government, the DPR is pending with the central    government. Therefore,   I request the hon\\u2019ble minister to give approval    for the construction of ring road in Bulandshahr. The construction work being done by    the   contractor/firm under the 'Har Ghar Jal' scheme under the Jal Jeevan          Mission in my parliamentary constituency Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh        is of poor quality and not up to the standard. The contractor has sub\\u00adlet     the work to small contractors, who do not have the experience of the         said work. Therefore, I request the Government to take immediate    cognizance of this matter and ensure strict action against the guilty       agency and officials by conducting a high\\u00adlevel inquiry.  The Agneepath scheme    of the central government will further strengthen the security of the    country and provide respectable employment. The scheme will prepare a    team of trained, disciplined and patriotic youth in the Indian Army. After       completing 4 years of service, these Agniveers will get priority in          government jobs on the basis of their merit. Many state governments      including Madhya Pradesh have announced to give priority to these       Agniveers in police recruitment. Even after this the unreasonable     opposition to this plan is causing worry. Before announcing the reforms,        the government should consult the experts of that field and consult with         the affected people so that there is no obstacle in the implementation of          public friendly policies. This will also curb those who create an      environment of negativity. Four\\u00adlaning project of Ahmednagar\\u00ad      Karmala\\u00adTembhurni Section of NH\\u00ad561A in Ahmednagar District in my        constituency has been progressing in a swift manner. However, the    condition of the existing road in urban areas, where 4 bypasses are         proposed, is very delicate. Before handing over the city portion length of         the project to PWD, one\\u00adtime improvement of this portion is very much          essential as per the norms of NHAI/MoRTH. I request the hon\\u2019ble     Minister to kindly consider one\\u00adtime improvement of these roads, where    bypass roads are proposed, by including it in the revised DPR. East Coast Corridor \\u2013    Kharagpur to Vijayawada was promised in the Union Budget 2021 and      the project was supposed to be commissioned by June 2022. The DPR     is facing a major delay of five months due to which the construction plan    of Dedicated Freight Corridor \\u00ad Eastern Corridor is on a standstill. I          strongly urge the Government to expedite the DPR process for timely     construction of DFCs and implement the Eastern DFC between    Kharagpur\\u00adVijayawada as promised. It is a critical step towards      reforming the freight transportation system in Andhra Pradesh. The Someshwar Parbat is situated in my  parliamentary Constituency. An ancient temple of Mata Kali is also  situated on this Parbat. Thousands of devotees from across Bihar and  Uttar Pradesh visit this temple every year during the Chaitra Shukla  Navratras. There is acute shortage of amenities for the devotees.  Therefore, I urge the government to develop the Someshwar Parbat on the  lines of  Mata Vaishno Devi Dham.  Attack of  shot hole borer pest on pomegranate has damaged thousands of hectares  of crop in my parliamentary Constituency Sholapur and the entire  Maharashtra. The committee constituted to study and inspect the  pomegranate crop in Sholapur has submitted its detailed report to the  horticulture department of ICAR. I urge upon the government to take  appropriate action on the report of the said committee to provide relief  and assistance to the farmers. When a law relating to the Family Court  comes into force, the Union government has the power to decide the date from  which that law will come into force in any state. In Nagaland and Himachal  Pradesh, the Act was yet to be implemented. This Bill has been brought in to  implement the policy decisions taken earlier with retrospective effect. But it was  a very golden opportunity to give a good direction to this country by changing  the three major points in this Bill. The first thing is that there is a skewed gender  ratio in the judiciary. Despite the fact that women should be given priority in the  appointment of judges in the family courts under the same Bill, the situation  today is that there are only less than 20 per cent women in the chair of judges in  the Indian Family Courts. In some High Courts, there is not a single woman  judge. Out of 33 judges in the apex Supreme Court, only there are four women  judges.  There was an opportunity in this Bill to make an amendment in it and  give more empowerment to women, so that they have an equal share in the  Family Courts. My second point is that there is a great need to set up a family  court bench in the appeal courts. When there is contempt of any order of the  court, no one takes it seriously. The third thing is that the tenure of marriage  counsellors has been fixed at three months and it should be increased. Marriage  counsellors are engaged with the victim for three months, so that they  understand the problems and help them. But what happens is that if a case goes  beyond three months, that counsellor is changed. The victim has to tell their  story again, it also takes time to understand the problem. I want to appeal  through you that women should be provided reservation in the Family Courts  because it is a matter of their future and the maximum number of victims here  are women. The issue of old parents referred to  here  is really a matter of family court.  Family court is not meant for women  only..  It is also for men and children as well., it is also for their parents, it is for  everyone.  There are 715 family courts in the country.  Hon. Minister and all of  us should tell our respective State Governments that it is important and more  and more courts should be established. This is very important for 125 crore  countrymen. If the matter is taken up in the High Court and the Supreme Court,  then it is  dragged for a long period. The resolution of settlement of family  disputes is very good.  It has been witnessed in India that  many times the rights  of men are not discussed. Under the Dowry Act, old parents are implicated, a  dozen of  family members are also implicated and then the case is  dragged on  in the  court for  years together  and it keeps going on.  The Government should  work hard and set up  more and more family courts.   The Family Courts were established  under the Family Courts Act, 1984 to promote conciliation and speedy disposal  of family disputes related to marriage. At present, family disputes are increasing  day by day, but in many cases reconciliation and counselling is taking place. I  would like to say that 715 family courts are currently functioning in 26 states,  but it is also true that more than 11 lakh 76 thousand cases are lying pending in  family courts. While supporting this, I would like to suggest that the number of  Family Courts should be increased. We have only one family court in Madhya  Pradesh. Madhya Pradesh is a big state and has a population of seven and a half  crores. In view of the increasing number of cases, I believe that the number of  family courts should be increased in Madhya Pradesh. Moreover, the number of  family courts is required to be increased in the states where there are less family  courts. A separate building should be  built for the family court and they should also have basic amenities because  children along with their families come to the family court. By doing this the  children will be saved from the ill\\u00adeffects of the court premises. Besides, I  would like to make a request to the Minister that if experts and experienced  advocates are engaged instead of the NGO in providing counselling in the  Counselling Centres that have been set up in every district, I feel that the matter  which lingers on for 10\\u00ad10 years in the court, will be settled soon. It will further  help provide counselling properly. It will immensely help women in deciding  their future. I rise to speak in support of this Bill. I would  like to ask the Hon'ble Law Minister as to how many decisions have been taken  in two courts of Nagaland since 2009. What is the number of cases that were  filed between 2009 and 2022 and what is the number of cases disposed of in the  lower courts as well as in the Appellate Court? In Himachal Pradesh also, how  many cases were disposed of since the year 2019 till date. Regarding the    establishment of the Permanent Bench of the High Court in the Western part of  Odisha, I would like to appeal to the Hon'ble Law Minister to take up the matter  with the Chief Minister of Odisha and the Chief Justice of the High Court of  Odisha. There are very few female judges in our society. I think there should be  more law colleges. There is a need to improve the quality of law education. I  would like to request the Government to establish a National School of Law in  my parliamentary constituency Bargarh or Jharsuguda district. I support the Family Courts  (Amendment) Bill, 2022. As on date, lakhs of cases are pending in family  courts across India. No one benefits anything from the longer time the trial  takes. In fact, neither the husband nor the wife wins, but both of them get  defeated and the lives of the family members associated with them, especially  the children, are badly affected. Who has given us the right to separate children  from their parents? It is a very serious matter. I would like all of us to think  seriously about this issue. Though the Family Court (Amendment) Bill is  undoubtedly very good, there are some other things like media trials which need  to be looked into. I urge upon the hon. Minister to look into these things. I  would also request that we should form a separate Ministry for children. The main godown of FCI is located  on the road from Modhera circle leading  to Dediasan in my parliamentary  constituency, Mahesana. Every day a large quantity of food grains is sent to  big districts like Gandhinagar, Patan and Mahesana from that godown.  Because of this, a long queue of trucks is formed on this road. Small  businessmen and people doing jobs around this road have to face a lot of  problems due to heavy traffic. Therefore, I would request you to take  necessary steps to shift the FCI godown somewhere outside the Mahesana  city. The Central Government employees should  be deployed rather than the State Government employees in the Eklavya  Adarsh Residential Schools on the lines of Navodaya Vidyalaya as the  Government of India is spending 100% of the amount under this scheme.  Besides, the quality of education imparted to the children taught by the  Central Government employees gets enhanced and it helps to bring them  into the mainstream of the country. It is a deplorable situation that the feudal set up in  the Darjeeling hills,Terai and Doars region have alienated the tea garden  workers from their basic land rights even after seven decades of  independence. Therefore, I request the Union Government to make a law  which will guarantee Praja Patta on the lines of the Forest Rights Act (2006)  to ensure justice for Tea and Cinchona garden workers. There is only one Navodaya  Vidyalaya in my parliamentary constituency, Banaskantha and a large  section of the region remains deprived of taking education in Navodaya  Vidyalaya due to the enormous size of the district,. Therefore, the  Government is requested to set up one more Navodaya Vidyalaya in Tharad  so that the children of the residents of the border area and farmers can get  the proper benefits of Navodaya Vidyalaya. The youth of my Lok Sabha  constituency apply for recruitment in the Indian Army every year. But due to  the Corona epidemic, the recruitment rallies have been suspended for the last  two years due to which the age of the youth of my Lok Sabha constituency  has crossed the prescribed upper age limit and now they are not eligible for  recruitment. One-time age relaxation was also given in the year 2021 by Air  Force and Navy. Therefore, my request to the hon. Minister is that in order  to secure the future of such youth who have exceeded the upper age limit  during the last two years due to the Corona epidemic, the Government  should give an age relaxation of 2 years in this year's recruitment process for  the Indian Army. I would like to draw the attention of he  Hon'ble Rural Development Minister to increase the number of working  days in MGNREGA. During the Corona period, the labourers were getting  proper work under MGNREGA, but now for about a year, on an average,  only 28-30 days of work is being provided to them. They are finding it very  difficult to survive in this high inflation period. The State of Bihar is the  State with the highest number of landless labourers in the country. They  should get 100 consecutive days of work under MGNREGA with a  guarantee. In Bihar too, wages under MGNREGA need to be fixed at more  than Rs. 300 as it is in Haryana. The Government of Bihar has been  continuously urging the Union Government for this purpose. This demand  should be accepted immediately and the pending amount of Bihar should be  paid and 100 days of work to all the labourers should also be ensured. I am glad that the Government of  India has taken initiative for the Coastal Highway under the Bharatmala  Pariyojana in my Parliamentary Constituency which covers around 70 km.  coastline. I would like to request that the details regarding total project cost,  project outlay, time frame of the project, the area covered (village-wise)  along with plan details for land acquisition and rehabilitation in the project  and present status of the project including the timeline of its commencement  may please be provided. Bihta-Aurangabad new rail project was  sanctioned in the year 2007 and the work of the project was to be completed in the  year 2011-12. The project will benefit the people of Patna, Arwal, Jehanabad and  Aurangabad. I urge that immediate steps should be taken for early completion of  the Bihta Aurangabad railway project. For the last many years local people are  demanding that in this extremism affected area Daltonganj of Jharkhand should be  connected with rail service via Gaya, Sherghati, Banke Bazar, Imamganj, Dumaria.  This expansion of rail service will be useful in better local connectivity as well as  in insurgency control. Biswanath Chariali is the headquarters of  Biswanath District which is an important city of northern Assam and has a lot of  commuters travelling to New Delhi on frequent basis. I request the hon. Railway  Minister for stoppage of 20505/20506 New Delhi-Dibrugarh Bi-Weekly Rajdhani  Express (vis  Bogibeel) and 22412/22411 Delhi-Naharlagun Arunachal Express at  Biswanath Chariali Railway Station and Gohpur Railway Station at the earliest. The Government is implementing the  Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) which includes the Solid-Liquid Waste  Management Program with the objective of bringing improvement in cleanliness,  hygiene and the general quality of life in rural areas.Villages with a population of  more than 5000 are provided funds directly for the construction of the drainage  systems. However, the said funds are inadequate and hence, I request the  Government to kindly remove the cap on funding for villages with 5000 plus  population and make necessary amendments to the existing guidelines in order to  provide funds for the construction of drainage systems in every village irrespective  of the population which will ensure proper waste management and reduce  pollution. The Government has been providing a substantial amount of  subsidy on chemical fertilizers which is about Rs 2,700 on Urea and about Rs.  2,500 per sack on DAPs. But in Chhattisgarh, alleged black marketing is taking  place and farmers are being exploited. Therefore, I would request the Hon'ble  Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers, through you, to take cognizance of this issue  and direct the State Government to ensure the availability of Urea and DAP for the  farmers at the prescribed rate. After the gruesome murder of Kanhaiya Lal, a  tailor, in my Parliamentary Constituency Udaipur, there was a situation of  communal tension and a planned conspiracy was hatched to spread communal  riots. When the agencies started investigating such a big incident, it was found that  the strings of the said murder were linked to the Pakistan-based Daawat-e-Islami  organization. This organization is active in Rajasthan and is constantly spreading  its wings.  I would like to request the Government of India, through you, that the  Daawat-e-Islami organization, which is constantly spreading in Rajasthan, should  be banned at the earliest and the culprits should be hanged till death by treating it a  special case of investigation so as to provide justice to the deceased Kanhaiya Lal.  The Nanded-Bidar Railway  Project is a very important railway project of my Parliamentary Constituency  connecting the two States of Maharashtra and Karnataka. I was informed by the  Ministry of Railways through a letter that the proposal is pending for the  concurrence of both the State Governments. Nearly a year has passed, but no  further progress has been made in this regard yet. I would like to request the  Government to impress upon the two concerned Governments to get land  acquisition done in their respective border areas within a minimum time frame and  hand over the Budget provisions to the Union Government at the earliest so that  the rural areas of all the beneficiary districts of this route are also benefited and the  Prime Minister's dream of connecting maximum rural areas with railway services  is also realized. Our country India is largely driven by  the precepts of religion. The Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, which originated in this  country about 5200 years ago, is a divine treatise of 700 shlokas. In this context, I  have a prayer and a valuable suggestion. According to our Panchang, \\\"Gita Jayanti  Diwas\\\" is celebrated on Margarshirsh Shukla Ekadashi. As per our belief, this day  is the symbolic birth anniversary of the Shrimad Bhagavad Gita. On this day,  before the Mahabharata war, Arjuna was preached the Gita by Lord Krishna.  Therefore, in order to give this great book its due honour in the world, an effort  should be made to declare this day as an \\\"International Day\\\" so that the attention of  the world's masses can be focused on its teachings. The matter of inclusion of Banjara community in the  category of Scheduled Tribes is pending with the Union Government for a long  time.  The Banjara community of Uttar Pradesh is in a very miserable condition  economically, socially, educationally and politically.  I request the Government to  take this issue seriously and include the Banjara community of Uttar Pradesh in the   list of Scheduled Tribes at the earliest.  In entire Gujarat including Rajkot  and Morbi districts water is supplied through canal for irrigating the farms. If  the water supply is converted into lift irrigation under the Pradhan Mantri  Sinchayee Yojana, more farm land can be used for cultivation and it can help in  increasing the income of farmers and in the production of crops. Due to departmental apathy, the work of  Ramganj-Mandi railway project is going on at a slow pace. My request to the  Hon'ble Railway Minister is to expedite the project and complete it at the  earliest. The work on NH-351 Mahua- Savarkundla-Amreli-Vadia-Jetpur, which was announced by the Prime Minister  in 2015, is going on at a very slow pace. Therefore, the Hon'ble Minister is  requested to build it a four-lane road by acquiring 45 metres of land in a new  way because it is the only National Highway in Amreli district and it caters to a  large volume of traffic. This road should be constructed in public interest and  keeping in mind the time factor so that money is not wasted and people can get  the facility. There is a need to convert national highway no.28  from Muzaffarpur, my Parliamentary constituency, to Barauni into four lanes.  The four-laning of this highway will give impetus to the overall development of  the people of North Bihar. I would like to demand from the Hon'ble Minister of  Road Transport and National Highways that the process of commencement of  implementation of NH-28 should be realised at the earliest in the public interest. Under Article 342 of the Indian Constitution, in  1950, the Lohar caste has been notified as a Scheduled Tribe in the Roman  script. In 2006, the Hindi translation of \\u2018Lohar\\u2019 was done as Lohara by the  Constitution Amendment Act 48/2006, which deprived the  Lohar community  of the rights of the scheduled tribes. The Government is, therefore, requested to  take necessary action to repeal the Constitution Amendment Act 48/2006 so that  Lohar caste can get the status of Scheduled Tribe as earlier. A proposal to set up an Integrated  Manufacturing Cluster (IMC) is under consideration of the Union Government  on 1,180 hectares of land of SAIL at Bhawanathpur in Garhwa district under  Palamu Parliamentary Constituecy in the State of Jharkhand under The National  Industrial Corridor Development Programme (NICDC). I would like to request  the Union Government to take further action for setting up an Integrated  Manufacturing Cluster (IMC) at the said place.   My Parliamentary constituency is  very backward in every field, especially in the field of education. Today, our  Government is taking forward the education system with radical and  revolutionary changes in the field of education. In this connection it has been  decided by the Ministry of Education to upgrade model schools in the name of  \\\"PM-Shri\\\" schools in all the blocks of the country by 2024. Under this scheme,  one school each from all the blocks of my Lok Sabha constituency like Panapur,  Taraiyan, Mashrak, Baniyapur, Lahaladpur (Janatabazar), Ekama, Manjhi,  Jalalpur, Bhagwanpur Haat, Maharajganj, Basantpur, Lakdinaviganj and  Gorayakothi should be selected and upgraded under the said scheme. A provision has been made in the Budget to provide  incentive to the farmers doing natural farming.  The Government of India is going to  launch a pilot project to promote natural farming for 10 kilometers on both sides of the  Ganges river.  I would like to demand from the government that rivers like Narmada,  Tamas, Semraval, Ken, Betwa should be included in the pilot project for natural farming  in Madhya Pradesh.  I would like to demand especially for the inclusion of Tamas,  Semraval and Satna rivers of Satna district in this scheme. Deoghar has been included in the list of tourist  destination by the Ministry of Tourism, Government of India.  This is religious and  cultural capital of Eastern India.  I request to set up a Military Station for which land is  available near the ongoing DRDO centre project at Deoghar (Jharkahand).  I also request  to set up an Ordinance Factory, DRDO Lab, Defence Recruitment Centre at Deoghar and  a Sainik School at Godda.  The paddy of the farmers of Chhattisgarh is  purchased by the Gramin Co-operative Society.  Paddy purchased in the month of  December is now being picked up in March.  It is my request to the Government that the  negligence shown by the administrative officers in this regard should be investigated and  the members of rural cooperative societies should be protected from financial loss. Lalitpur-Singrauli rail project is very important for  my rail-less parliamentary constituency Sidhi and the dream of the region is about to  come true.  I request that the concerned officers should be directed to expedite the works  of Rewa to Singrauli part of Lalitpur-Singrauli rail line so that the project can be  completed within the stipulated time frame.  Fencing has been done at several  bordering places in Jammu and Kashmir for which lands of farmers have been acquired.   These farmers have lost their employment.  Compensation should be given to them at the  earliest.     West Bengal is a major potato-growing  State of India.  Farmers store their produce in cold storages.  West Bengal has vast  growth potential in the horticulture sector and there is a requirement to shift from cold  storages to integrated cold chains to realise its full potential.  So, I request the  Government to sanction an integrated cold storage for potatoes in my constituency of  Arambagh.  Work on widening of N.H. 52 from 2 lanes to 4 lanes  in my Parliamentary Constituency, Churu is to begin.  During inspection of the road, the  officers found that VUPs and CUPs are required to be constructed at several places.  So, I  request the Government through this August House to construct ROBs, VUPs and CUPs  as required at all these places.   Belgaum airport is the oldest  airport in Karnataka.  Belgaum is an educationally and industrially forward city.  It has  often been the persistent demand of the people to start the daily flights on the routes  Belagavi-Bangalore (morning flight), Belagavi-Gorakhpur (Uttar Pradesh), Belagavi- Darbhanga-Gaya (Bihar), Belagavi-Shirdi (Maharashtra), and Belagavi-Varanasi with  stress for the start of cargo services too.  Hence, I request the hon. Minister of Civil  Aviation to please look into the matter.  I congratulate our hon. Prime  Minister and the hon. Minister of External Affairs for the safe evacuation of the Indian  individuals from Ukraine as a part of the Government\\u201fs \\u201eOperation Ganga\\u201f. Now, our  Government should do something for these students so that their study is not affected. It  should also increase the number of medical seats in our country. The war is still going on.   But, our Indian Government has taken a pragmatic view. We need to adopt a balanced  approach while giving statement on a situation like Ukraine-Russia. There are a number  of imported items like crude oil, wheat and fertilizers, for which we are dependent on  Ukraine. The cost of these items has gone up. The Government has to see the ways by  which this war can be stopped totally.   The State Government of Jharkhand has  requested to transfer Bhogta community from the list of Scheduled Castes to the list of  Scheduled Tribes and to include certain communities.  From the Odisha point of view, I  would say that we have Bhogta community in Odisha also. A task force was formed in  2015 under the chairmanship of the Secretary of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs and that  Task Force examined the proposals for inclusion from various States including 107  proposals from Odisha. In its Report notified in 2014, it recommended inclusion of the  following ten communities of Odisha in the ST list of the State on priority basis. Puran  community of Jharkhand has been approved. This community of Odisha should also be  added. The other communities are Bhagata/Bhukta/ Bhogta or Bhokta , Durua, Kalanga,  Nakasia, Paba, Khandayat Bhuyan, Tamudia or Tamadia, Chapua Kamar and Kandhia.  These are the ten tribes that have been recommended by the Task Force and this list is  pending with the Ministry.  When are these communities going to be included in the ST  list? Odisha Government has sent 107 proposals and the Task Force identified ten tribes  of them. Similarly, I have spoken last time about Saara community. They should be  included in the scheduled Tribes.  On the inclusion of communities in the SC list of  Odisha, since 1978, proposals for inclusion of different Castes/ communities are being  submitted to the government of India at different points of time.  I would like to know  from the Hon. Minister as to when these communities are going to be included in the SC  list of Odisha. On behalf of Bahujan Samaj Party, I strongly  support the Constitution (Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes) Orders (Amendment)  Bill, 2022.This Bill has been brought to omit the Bhogta community of Jharkhand state  from the list of Scheduled Castes  and to  be  included in the list of Scheduled Tribes and  also include certain other communities like Deshwari, Ganjhu, Daulatbandi, Patbandi,  Raut, Majhia,  Khairi, and Tamdia. For the welfare of Scheduled Tribes, a provision of  more than 12 percent of the budget has been made in the budget for the year 2022-23.  Earlier in Uttar Pradesh, there used to be zero balance admission, now the same has been  discontinued.If the people of SC and ST  had money to deposit fees,  they would not be  seeking scholarship. I demand that,as in the past when   admission was given on zero  balance, in the same way admission should again  be given  on zero balance and  scholarship should be given to provide education to the people of SC and ST. I would like to request the Minister of Fertilizer and  Chemicals that bio manure (Phosphate Rich Organic Manure) is the best alternative for  Phosphorous manure.  Therefore, the direct subsidy should be provided to those farmers  and institutions who demand for Phosphate Rich Organic Manure.  An important and big railway station,  Ajmer is functional in my Parliamentary Constituency.  There is need to ply  DEMU/MEMU trains from Ajmer to Abu road.  Udaipur-Ajmer- Haridwar/Rishikesh  superfast train no. 19609-19610 plies three days in a week, needs to be made a daily  train.  Ajmer-Jammutavi train no. 12413-12414 should be extended to Katara. Jaipur- Prayagraj train no. 12403-12404 should be extended from Ajmer or Pushkar connecting  to famous pilgrim places of the country.  The train no. 12987-12988 Ajmer \\u2013Siyaldah  Express train be named after the valiant emperor Prithviraj Chauhan and train no. 19607- 19608 Madar-Ajmer-Kolkata weekly Express train be nomenclated as \\u201cBrahma Express\\u201d  to the name of Lord Brahma. I, through you, request the concerned department to  take necessary measures for speedy development of Hajeera port and streamlining of  cargo facilities there.  I through you request the Government to  kindly instruct the concerned railway officers to construct an over-bridge near  Kharkhauda railway station at Kharkhauda-Mohiuddin road. Rapid urbanization in the recent  past has put the Pune city\\u201fs travel infrastructure to stress.  Phase 1 of Maharashtra Metro  Rail Corporation (Maha Metro) is nearing completion.  I request the hon. Minister of  Housing and Urban Affairs to put all phase-2 projects on fast track so that the people of  Pune will get the much-required rapid transport to get rid of traffic jams.  Bhilwara is famous as textile city in  the whole world and Mega Textile Park is our right.  I therefore, request the Union  Government to call for more proposals from the state Government for the setting up of  Mega Textile Park at several places and the Ministry should select the place after  conducting the survey in this regard. I request the hon. Ministry of Labour and Employment to  set up ESIC Hospitals in the tea gardens.  I also request for the construction of an AIIMS  in North Bengal region and the establishment of Medical Colleges in Darjeeling and  Kalimpong District Hospitals.  I would like to say that I have requested both  Central and State Governments on several occasions for checking the erosion by Ganga  and Fulhar rivers.  So far no concrete measures have been taken.  There is a need to  formulate an action plan for resolving this problem.  The erosion affected people should  be rehabilitated and should also be given compensation.  The young athletes from my  constituency have been performing exceptionally at national and international level  tournaments by winning Gold, Silver and Bronze in various events.  I request the  Government to kindly expedite the functioning of SAI Centre and synthetic track for the  benefit and development of our athletes.  The development of adequate infrastructure will  also further the aim of a Fit and Healthy India which has been the flagship programme of  our Prime Minister. In my Parliamentary Constituency,  Jamshedpur, the proposed waterway Chandil-Swarnarekha river can be linked to Haldia  (West Bengal) via Tata Nagar to Odisha.  This waterway of my parliamentary  constituency also figures in the list of hundred waterways of the country. I request the  hon. Minister to please let me know the present status of this waterway and the time by  which this waterway is proposed to be made functional for the passengers.  The National Health Mission is being  run by the Government of India since the year 2005 where the doctors have been  recruited on contract basis.  I request the Government to kindly regularize the services of  these lekhs of doctors and other employees.  There is a strong demand for various  underground passages and ROBs in various places in Rayagada and Koraput districts of  Odisha.  I would like to request the Ministry of Railways to ensure that train stoppage at  Laxmipur Road Station be restored at the earliest.  The Budaga Jangam community was  recognized as Scheduled Caste in Part-1 of the Constitution and it was listed at Serial No.  19 in undivided Andhra Pradesh Scheduled Castes List.  Yet the community is denied the  benefit of reservation.  I request the Government of India to consider their long pending  demand of Budaga Jangam people for their inclusion in Scheduled Castes List. I sincerely request the hon. Minister or  Railways to take necessary steps and make the Chandkhali Halt Station functional as  soon as possible. The shifting of the headquarters of the  National Board for Workers Education from Nagpur to Delhi should be reconsidered and  this board may kindly be allowed to be functional from there.   I request the Union Government to kindly  make necessary arrangements for Government tube-wells for irrigation and supply of safe  drinking water in my Parliamentary Constituency, Shravasti.    The main objective of this Bill is to exclude the  Gond community of Sant Kabir Nagar, Kushi Nagar, Chandauli and Sant Ravidas Nagar  districts from the list of Scheduled Castes and include them in the list of Scheduled  Tribes as proposed by the Government of Uttar Pradesh.  I would like to suggest that the  programmes formulated for the benefit of SCs and STs should be implemented properly.   Presently, more than 3 crore 20 lakh students of different weaker sections are drawing  scholarships in the country.  I would like to suggest that more and more schools,  especially residential schools, should be opened so that the poor children can get  education without any hindrance and they can develop educationally to be a part of the  main stream. I support this Bill. Gond community of Uttar Pradesh should be  included in the list of Scheduled Tribes so that they can take benefit of different  government schemes.  Besides, 17 OBC castes of Uttar Pradesh should be included in the  list of Scheduled Castes.  Upliftment of the people of SC and ST can be possible only  when they get full benefit of reservation. I request Hon. Prime Minister to stop  privatization or provide reservation in private sector also. Our Government is doing justice to the  people of this Gond community living in Sant Kabir Nagar, Kushinagar, Chandoli and  Ravidas districts by including them in the list of Scheduled Tribes. I would like to thank  the Government for this move. The benefits being provided by the Union Government  fail to reach our tribal people living in Gadchiroli, Amravati, Yavatmal, Gondia and  Nandurbar. Hence, such a provision needs to be made that may facilitate those benefits to  reach them directly instead of routing them through the State Government. Moreover, the  facilities of hospital, education and banking should be made available to the tribal people  in their own areas. The Government is going to roll out the 4G scheme for the tribal  areas, hence, my Parliamentary Constituency, Amravati may also be covered under the  said scheme so that, it may be of substantial help for our students in getting education. Hon'ble Prime Minister of the country has been in  favour of 'One Nation, One Election' since the very first day. If voting is also made  compulsory, then the position of India in the world, wherever it stands today, will get  stronger further. Out of 196 countries in the world, there are only 33 countries where  voting is compulsory. Out of 33 countries, there are 19 such countries wherein if people  do not go to exercise their franchise, then a certain penalty is imposed on them. Countries  where voting is mandatory include Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Cyprus, Congo, Fiji, Peru,  Singapore, Switzerland, Turkey. In Singapore, if someone does not cast his vote, his right  to vote is taken away. In fact, the more people vote, the better and stronger the leadership  will emerge and the better people will be elected. I would like to request that the  government should definitely consider the Private Member Bill which has come on this  subject. At the same time, One Nation and One Election should also be considered  because billions of rupees are spent on elections and when elections are held at different  times in the states, all the work comes to a halt there for three to six months. If we plant Neem and Pipal on large scale in Delhi,  pollution could be controlled effectively.  The sugarcane cultivation undertaken 200 kms.  around Delhi can play an effective role in checking the pollution as this crop emits a lot  of Oxygen. It is responsible only for 20 per cent pollution.  There is need to make  necessary arrangements for procurement of sugarcane stubble so as to control pollution.  The US is getting the neem tree patented.   There is a need to encourage plantation of  Neem 200 kms around Delhi and also in the whole country.  The global temperature is  rising leading to erratic high or low flow of water in our rivers.  There is need for creating  a balance in this regard. Climate Change and Global Warming are  sensitive global issues.   I have a few suggestions for the hon. Minister.  The Government  needs to pass an executive order to make it mandatory for all commercial vehicles to  have slogans written on both sides of vehicles for protection of environment for clearance  as commercial vehicles.  Our glaciers are melting and groundwater level is going down.  Our earth, air and water are all polluted. We need to protect them all.  We need to create  awareness in this regard.  We also need to move to electric vehicles at the earliest. Today, steps are being taken to control climate change in  our country under the leadership of hon. Prime Minister. The Government has been  implementing the national action plan on climate change. The NCR has been facing the  scourge of pollution. Our Government has done much to make the Ganga river clean. The  Government needs to work on the Yamuna river as well. There is industrial area in  Secundrabad and Khurja, where pollution controlling plants have not been installed in  some of the industries. I would like to urge upon the hon. Minister to formulate stringent  rules to make the industries install their plants through latest technology so as to save the  entire NCR  from pollution. I am heartily grateful to you for giving me  the opportunity to participate in the discussion on climate change. Carbon emission in  Delhi is so much that the whole city has become a gas chamber and an important  suggestion has been given to plant more of Peepal and Neem trees in place of Kikar trees  in the ridge area of Delhi to reduce carbon emission. It is not appropriate to blame the  farmer only for carbon emission. Ofcourse, carbon emission takes place through burning  of stubble and crops residue by farmers but carbon is emitted more in the name of  urbanisation and by airconditioned machinery and in larger quantity by big and small  vehicles in the cities. The laws in this country have to pass through two types of norms.  One for rich and one for poor. The manner in which the climate change has started  changing the geographical situation, the day is not far when there would be an outcry for  living all over if no timely attention has been paid in this regard. The whole nation from  the rural level to cities should become alert and aware in a mission mode in this regard  and should work to adopt ways to reduce carbon emission. Preservation and  beautification of ponds and lakes should be ensured in the villages. The Government and other agencies concerned  and the Federations and Associations have to work together harmoniously and in a  coordinated manner to fulfill the objectives of the National Sports Policy, 2001.  Insufficiency of financial resources has been a major constraint in promoting sports in  India. While the Union and the State Governments need to allocate higher budgetary  provisions, special efforts are equally called for to mobilize corporate funds for the  development of sports in the country. Tripartite agreements among the Government, the  sports federations concerned and the corporate houses may be entered into for different  sports disciplines. A suitable package of incentives may also be evolved for this purpose.  The National Sports Development Fund was created with the initial contribution of the  Union Government. The mobilization of resources for the Fund should be strenuously  pursued. Various grievances and difficulties encountered by the sports personnel of  bodybuilding, kabaddi and kho-kho need to be addressed at the earliest. In sports, code  categorization is there - Priority; General; and Others. This categorization is based on  medals, performance and international events. The Government should encourage games  under the category of 'Others', i.e. kabaddi and kho-kho, which are played in rural and  tribal areas. Mumbai Suburban Kabaddi Association alone has more than 600 registered  teams. Though Kabaddi is a non-Olympic game, more financial support should be given  to kabaddi and body-building. The history of sports in India dates back to  ancient times. Along with the traditional sports like Kabaddi, Chess, Kho-Kho,  Wrestling, Gilli-Danda, Archery etc., various sports around the world are being played in  the country today. In our country, talented players get unrecognized as they play with the  people around them in their own cities. For that we need technique, fitness, training,  proper exercise as well as food and positive environment in sports. Under the Khelo India  scheme, world class sports stadiums are being constructed and sports academies are being  established in the country. Sports infrastructure projects have been sanctioned to meet the  requirements of different categories of sports and sportspersons. Basketball is the state  sport of Rajasthan. Most of the youth in Jaipur city are playing this sport. One STC center  of Sports Authority of India is functioning in Basketball discipline at Vidyadhar Nagar  Stadium, Jaipur. Keeping in view the demands of the Basketball players of my  Parliamentary Constituency, Jaipur the Sports Training Center may be developed  at the  earliest. This Bill strengthens the Delhi  Municipal Corporation. If MCD will not remain financially strong and it will continue to  be financially weak then beautification of Delhi will not be materialized. Also, the MCD  in Delhi is looking after the city as well as the villages. It is also looking after the  unauthorized colonies. After unification, all expenses will be curtailed and Rs 200 crore will be saved by  the MCD every year. Also, we will have equal revenue distribution system. I would also  like to say that three MCDs are not needed because 12 zones are already in existence. In  this regard, I would suggest that there should be only 12 nominated members i.e.  Aldermen in the 12 zones of Delhi. My second suggestion is that the power to nominate  them should be with the LG or the Mayor. Also, there is a need to implement the report  of Finance Commission. My third suggestion is that the Municipal Councilor should get  at least an allowance as much as a sweeper. Also, the power related to Delhi Jal Board,  Delhi Vidyut Board, Fire Department, DUSIB, DTC should vest with MCD. My Parliamentary Constituency, Sambalpur is  located in the Western region of the state.  It is known as the Commercial and Industrial  hub of western Odisha.  I urge upon the central government to set up a Medical  Equipment Park at Sambalpur during the financial year 2022-23.  In order to increase the number of  tourists in the country, we should also consider developing new tourist places.  There are  memorials of many brave martyrs in village Naggi, village Lakhahakam and village  Hindumalkot located in Sriganganagar district on the Indo-Pak border.  I request the  central government that these historical places of my parliamentary constituency should  be developed as a tourist site so that along with tourism, employment opportunities can  also be generated in this area.  The purpose of vaccination is to  protect adolescent children from Corona virus infection.  Adolescent boys and girls  studying in educational institutions in the age group of 15 to 18 years are getting this  vaccine, but there is a section of this age group which does not go to educational  institutions.  The government is requested to take necessary steps to get them vaccinated.   Level crossing no. B/159 located  near Bhildi-Samdadi railway station in my Parliamentary Constituency Banaskantha  (Gujarat).  Due to the dense population here and also due to heavy traffic, there has been  a demand for the construction of ROB from the railways.  Hon. Minister is requested to  take prompt action for construction of this ROB by the Railways so that the residents of  my parliamentary constituency can get the benefit of it. Extracting edible oil from Sal (Shal) seeds and  Mahua seeds in my parliamentary constituency and surrounding districts can be a good  healthy and cheap option which is available in abundance.  I would like to request the  government that there is a need to set up a large processing industry (unit) for making  edible oil from Sal (Shal) seeds and Mahua seeds in Gumla, Jharkhand, which will also  lead to economic development of the local people and the forest products can also be  used on a large scale.  According to Article 16 of the Constitution, there is  a provision of 27 percent reservation for backward castes in the entire country in public  service appointments.  Reservation to the backward castes increases their status in the  society.  I request the government to implement the 27 percent reservation of OBCs in the  Delhi Judicial Service so that the status of other backward caste people living in the Delhi  capital may be increase in society.  Thousands of tribals from hundreds of villages in Bastar  Dantewada, Bijapur, Sukma Naxal affected areas  had migrated to Andhra Pradesh and  Telangana leaving their homes and villages in the border states  had fled. The tribals  settled in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana after migrating about 15-16 years ago are now  allegedly forcibly evicted from their states by the governments and their houses are also  being demolished. My demand is that the central government should make a policy  similar to the rehabilitation of the Bru tribals and the tribals should be given the right to  live where they are, so that the problem of re-migration of the tribals settled in Andhra  Pradesh and Telangana by migrating can be solved.  The Odisha Government has implemented  \\u2018Mission Shakti\\u2019.  It provides support to about seven lakh women SHGs including around  70 lakh rural women who have been successfully assisted by enabling them to access  financial assistance, undertake capacity strengthening to enhance their livelihoods and  incomes.  Hence, I request the Union Government to consider allotment of a special fund  for women SHGs in Odisha, which will enable them to secure their livelihood.  Millions of tourist and Buddhists from all  corner of the country and abroad visit the world famous historical tourist place, Shravasti.   Two years ago, the Ministry of Civil Aviation had announced the commissioning of  Shravasti Aairport, whose construction work has been  going on at slow pace for a long  time.  So, I would like to request the Government that the airport in Shravasti, Uttar  Pradesh should be made operational at the earliest by completing the construction work  on priority basis.  As per the Statement of Objects and  Reasons, the Chartered Accountant Act, 1949, The Cost and Works Accountant Act,  1959 and the Company Secretaries Act, 1980 are proposed to be amended. It was all the  more necessary to have strong disciplinary mechanism in the institutions for ensuring  their growth and streamlining. A timeline is being laid down for all the works. The  functioning of all these three institutions must be reviewed at regular intervals and ways  and means should be found out for improvement therein. Also the autonomy of these  three institutions must be maintained. The statutory monopoly that was provided  to certain organisations or institutions earlier is now being changed. Over the years, the  Government has taken various measures to curb possible corporate misdoings. In recent  years, the role of some Chartered Accountants has also come under regulatory scanner.  The move to reform the disciplinary mechanism of professionals is a part of effort to  improve corporate governance. The Chartered accountants play a key role in the  preparation and audit of financial statements. The Bill proposes a time-limit on resolving  the cases under investigation. While stronger penalties and punishments will act as a  deterrent, it may also dissuade Chartered Accountant professionals from joining together  to form bigger audit firms. The amendment makes it impossible for audit firms to escape  accountability for misdeeds by any of its partners. The Standing Committee has also  made some good suggestions. In India, the ICAI has the statutory monopoly power over  the whole profession. Setting up of academic institutes for accounting for further  development of the accounting and finance profession is praiseworthy. The role of the  Head of Council and the Executive Head may be separated. I must say that it is important  to facilitate a business-friendly environment for corporate as well as professionals in  India. Opening of professional services to competition is necessary and therefore, audit  firms should be allowed to advertise with some restrictions. The Advocates Act, 1961  also needs to be rationalised. This Bill aims to constitute a Disciplinary  Directorate/Board for these three institutes. I want to request the Government to appoint  at least one Director disciplinary and two joint directors in all these institutes.  Out of  these three posts one each should be reserved for the Scheduled Caste and Backward  Class respectively. I would like to draw the  attention of the Government towards the problems of my Latur Parliamentary  Constituency which is facing severe drought due to which the people are facing water  crisis not only for drinking purpose but for irrigation also.  My request to the Government  is that a scheme should be formulated and implemented at the earliest   for intergrated  development of Latur district by including it in the list of aspirational districts. The  Government has taken a decision few years back to set up Latur Railway Coach Factory  in this region.  My request is that the supply of   raw material  should be made from  local  sources so that allied industries can be set up here  and alongwith industrial development,  the employment opportunities  can also be increased.  While making recruitment in this  coach factory, alteast 70 percent of the employees /labourers should be recruited from  this region.  The arrangement of drinking water should be ensured by expediting the     programme of \\u201cHar Ghar Jal Har Ghar Nal\\u201d, programme under National Jal Jeevan  Mission.  A scheme should be formulated and implemented at the earliest for providing  irrigation facility through pipe from Ujjani dam in the rural areas of Latur district under  Rural Drinking Water Programme. Immediate steps should be taken for conservation and  revival  of  Manjari river.  Steps  should be taken to revive  the economy  so that  employment opportunites  can be generated and migration  can be checked. Hence my request to the Government is    that necessary steps should be taken  to start the work of this proposed new railway line    at the earliest after  considering  the suggestions on priority basis . Further, steps should  be taken  to make necessary budgetary provisions  in 2022 Budget . I thank you for giving me this  opportunity to express my views on Hon. President's Address.  It is a matter of pride that  our country is one of the countries which have given the highest number of vaccine doses  in the world.  During the Covid pandemic, agriculture, education and employment sector  suffered huge losses and the people became unemployed. But, the Government didn't do  anything for them. On the one hand, the efforts of the Government have also increased  the country's agricultural exports to record levels. On the other hand, import of steel and  palm oil is causing economic losses to the people, farmers and workers.  The Government  has included Osmanabad Parliamentary Constituency among the Aspirational  districts.  This district should be awarded such a project which may provide employment  to the people of the said district. The Government has not taken any necessary steps to  stop the arbitrariness being done and the rules being formulated by the insurance  companies. Therefore, the Government should take quick action to close the fraudulent  companies and to set up Government companies in its place.   The Government has not  considered the pending demand of the people to include Tuljabhavani Mandir in taluk  Tuljapur of Osmanabad District (Maharashtra) among central tourist spots. This demand  should be fulfilled.  Osmanabad-Tuljapur and Ramalinga Tirth should be connected with  the proposed railway line of Mumbai-Hyderabad bullet train.  The Government should  immediately issue an order to set up a textile industry hub at Kaudgaon MIDC in  Osmanabad.  Barshi Textile Mill in Barshi taluk of Solapur district (Maharashtra) should  be reopened.  Immediate steps should be taken to upgrade the Osmanabad city  airport.  Arrangements should be made to open branches of State Bank of India and  Maharashtra Gramin Bank in the various villages of Osmanabad district. We all join the Honourable  President, in thanking all frontline COVID warriors.  I request Union Government to  ensure insurance for all.  Central Government should provide adequate support for  Andhra Pradesh.  To complete the Polavaram project, we are looking forward to Union  Government\\u201fs support.  This project will provide drinking water and irrigation facilities  to thousands of acres of land across four districts and will benefit lakhs of farmers.  We  thank the Prime Minister for resolving Jammu and Kashmir issue, for developing Kashi  and Ayodhya.  We need to bring electoral reforms so that common people can elect their  representative freely.  The practice of collecting taxes from poor people and providing  concessions to rich, should change.  I request that all required funds should be released  by the Central Government.  There is no single word about Women\\u201fs Reservation Bill in  the President\\u201fs address.  Women\\u201fs Reservation Bill is the need of the hour. I oppose the introduction of this Bill. Various personal  laws will be affected by this Bill. This Bill should be referred to the Standing Committee  for greater scrutiny.   The Government is aggressively  bringing in Bills without consulting with the Opposition. This Bill needs to be scrutinised  and all the stakeholders should be consulted. We must unanimously pass any reforms, if  they have got to do with women. The government must send this Bill to the Standing  Committee for detailed discussions. It is very important that such an  important Bill has to be sent to the standing committee or to the Select Committee. They  have to review it, ask for opinions from civil society and then bring in this Bill. The Bill was introduced today and  what is that tearing hurry to pass it. If the hon. Minister wants electoral reforms, he  should take this Bill back and bring a comprehensive Bill of entire electoral reforms  including women\\u2019s reservation and electoral bonds. This Bill needs to be discussed.  Giving opportunity for four times to enrol themselves is a good thing. What happened in  Talangana and Andhra Pradesh in 2015-16? In the Telangana Election, 30 lakh people  could not vote and in Andhra Pradesh, what happened was because of seeding of  Aadhaar and this data together, the previous Government could go ahead and make sure      whom to be given what and whom to be taken out. So, I request the Minister to again  please come with a comprehensive Bill so that proper discussion can happen in the  House. I support the second batch of Demand  for Supplementary Grants for the year 2021-22 and make the following demands in respect  of my constituency. Satna Medical College sanctioned by the Government in the year  2018 has not been given financial approval for construction of hospital at the cost of  rupees 250 crore. This approval should be provided at the earliest. Assistance of Rs.  25,000 is being provided to the Disabled under ADIP Scheme run by the Ministry of  Social Justice and Empowerment for purchasing motorised tricycle at the cost of Rs.  45,000. It is requested that the difference in the cost should also be included in the  budget. Approval for constructing four lane road to connect my parliamentary  constituency Satna, Kotar, Rewa to Semaria, Sirnour, Jawa, Shankargarh, Prayagraj  under the 'Bharatmala' Project should be given. An I.I.T educational institution should be  set up in my Satna district which is an industrial district and is also being developed as a  smart city. There is a long pending demand to establish Sainik school in my  parliamentary constituency and Maihar. I demand the setting up of a sports college, as a  sports complex is being developed at the cost of Rs. 40 crore. Joint Water Supply Scheme  should be sanctioned for Satna, Rewa, Sidhi districts under the 'Har Ghar Nal Se Jal'  scheme. Chitrakoot and Maihar are two major pilgrimage centres. These should be  declared as special pilgrimage centres. Open sanctuaries should be developed for the  grazing of stray animals in order to save the farmers crops. Branches of nationalised  banks should be established in Ramgarh and Ghunwara of Satna district. The decision on  issuance of small finance bank license to large scale indigenous companies by the  Reserve Bank of India should be taken at the earliest. I extend my support to the second  batch of Demands for Supplementary Grants for the year 2021-22 and would like to place  certain demands regarding my state and my Lok Sabha Constituency before the  Government. Padalse Project should be included under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai  Yojana and Seven Barrage Project should be operationalised at the earliest which will  benefit farmers and citizens in Chalisgaon, Amalner, Dharangaon, Bhadgaon, Pachora  and Jalgaon and also address the problem of lack of irrigation and water supply which  has caused heavy financial and emotional distress to the farmers in my constituency. The  small cities like Chalisgaon, Amalner etc should be included under AMRUT 2.0 scheme.  Indore-Jalgaon-Pune route is a very useful route industrially and educationally. Flights  should be started at the earliest from this route in view of its heavy demand. Today our country is soaring and has become one of the  fastest growing economies in the world. With the singular vision of transforming India by  transforming our infrastructure, our government is helping usher in economic prosperity,  and providing a platform for sustainable development at the grassroots level. Our region  attracts the largest number of tourists in the Eastern Himalayan region. I request Hon'ble  Finance Minister to kindly consider a special financial support package to tour, taxi,  hotel, restaurant and homestay operators, majority of whom operate Medium and Small-  Scale Enterprises. There is an acute need for the establishment of Cold Storage facilities.  I am requesting that entrepreneurs in our region be provided with same incentives and  support as rest of North East India. There is immense potential in developing Darjeeling  as an education hub. I request Hon'ble Finance Minister to kindly allocate additional  funds for the Smart City initiative, so that Siliguri can be developed as a Smart City.  While tourism and business activities have grown manifold, infrastructure in our region is  grossly inadequate. Bagdogra is the only airport catering to entire North Bengal-yet the  facilities here are abysmal. Bagdogra is one of the 20 busiest airport in India. Darjeeling  and Tea are synonymous. The Union Government has announced Rs 1000 crores towards  welfare of tea garden workers from West Bengal and Assam. Timely implementation of  the projects under this fund, for the welfare of the tea workers will go a long way in  addressing various issues they have continued to face. I request for timely disbursement  of Subsidy and other funds to the tea plantations in North Bengal. The Government is providing funds for several  important heads like fertilizer subsidy, export promotion, Defence and Home departments  through the Supplementary Demands for Grants. The Government proposes to constitute  National River Interlinking Authority (NIRA). Two out of the four sanctioned schemes  under this project are in Bihar. If Kosi and Mehsi rivers are interlinked, a large area will  get rid of floods. It is necessary to accord the status of special state to Bihar.  My district  Sitamarhi is an aspirational  district for which additional funds should be allocated. The  Government should ask all the PSUs to spend CSR funds there. The Government should  have a special discussion on the issue of crypto currency in the House before enacting a  law on the subject. Sitamarhi should be brought on the tourist map of the country and  developed on the lines of Ayodhya. The hon. Finance Minister has come before the  House with one of the largest Supplementary Demands, in recent times. However, I did  not find any mention of additional expenditure on Covid vaccination. So, I would like to  ask the Government about the amount spent so far and the additional amount required for  the Covid vaccination. I would also like to draw the attention of the House to a few points  about Andhra Pradesh before getting on to the Supplementary Demands for Grants. One  of the major assurances was the granting of the \\u2018Special Category Status\\u2019 for the State,  which is still pending. Polavaram, the lifeline of Andhra Pradesh, continues to get  delayed. So, I would request the Government to release the dues to Andhra Pradesh and  approve the second revised cost estimates of the project without any further delay. I  would also request to announce the package to the backward districts of Andhra Pradesh  on the lines of KBK and the Bundelkhand region. Similarly, setting up of Kadapa Steel  Plant is another mandate for the Government of India in the A.P. Reorganisation Act. So,  kindly announce the setting up of this steel plant in Andhra Pradesh. Again, I strongly  appeal to reconsider the decision of privatising RINL and let it run as it has started  earning profits. With these Supplementary Demands, the size of the Budget goes up from  Rs. 34.83 lakh crore to Rs. 37.82 lakh crores which is an increase of nearly 9 per cent. I  wish to know from the Government as to what extent these additional Supplementary  Demands would see slippage on the fiscal deficit front.  According to a 2019 study report by the  Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Cannabis consumption was steadily  growing across the country. Alcohol is the common psychoactive substance used by  Indians. I would like to further add that we should give more teeth to the Narcotics  Control Bureau. The Government of Andhra Pradesh has set up a special task force to  curb the flow of drugs and other sedatives into the State. As the peddlers are using  innovative means to smuggle narcotic substances, the Union Government should  supplement the efforts of AP Police to succeed in a fight against the ganja menace. The  Government must promote Inter-State police coordination to exchange intelligence  practices and techniques to curtail cannabis cultivation and capture the perpetrators. Anti- cannabis campaigns must be launched across the country. The Government should take  initiative for providing required treatment in the rehabilitation centres by extending the  support to NGOs in the country. The Union Government should design a comprehensive  policy to curtail the narcotics problem in the country. I would like to request the Union  Government to educate and create awareness among the youth of the country on the ill  effects of addiction to narcotics and psychotropic substances as it is the youngsters who  are the future of this great nation. A balanced budget has been presented  in this unprecedented recession period due to epidemic Covid-19. Even at the  time of the disaster of Covid-19, the government worked to provide free ration  to the poor and needy in the entire lockdown period. Similarly, money was  been provided directly to the Jan Dhan accounts of our rural mothers and  sisters. Again it is a commendable step to provide adequate funds under the  Urban Water Life Mission in this Budget.  I take this opportunity to demand  from the Government Katra Medniganj, Pratapgarh City nagar panchayats in  that the Bela  municipal council of my Lok Sabha constituency Pratapgarh,  should be allocated funds for drinking water, sewer line, lighting, etc. by  including it under Amrit Yojana.  I also demand from the Government to  construct a service lane across the National Highway passing through my Lok  Sabha constituency Pratapgarh.  Also, LHB coaches should be provided in  the trains passing through my Lok Sabha area Pratapgarh. The Budget presented by the  Government has helped in handling India's economy at the time of the corona  epidemic.  In fact, the government has served the people during the Corona  period.  I would like to request the Government that there should be a bypass  with dividers from Pratappur to three kilometres.  There are mainly three  major demands of our region. Mewar is a very important tourist destination in  Dungarpur.  There is a bridge to be constructed at Sangam of all the three  rivers.  The work pertaining to the beautification and widening of roads is also  required to be commenced here.  At the same time, sufficient funds are  required for construction of culvert.  So, it should be included in the Budget. I welcome this Budget of the year  2021-22. This Budget has given focus on villages, poors, farmers, youth,  unemployed and businessmen. This Budget is for everyone and for  development for everyone. I urge upon the Minister of Finance to formulate a  policy for outsourcing of employment for youth of the country so that  exploitation of this unemployed youths of the country must be stopped. My  Lok Sabha Constituency Kaushambi has a very glorious history but this  district is totally industry less. I would like to request the Hon. Finance Minister  to fix the honorarium of at least rupees five thousand for ASHA workers of this  country. A majority of the population of the country  belongs to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe. But the Hon. Finance  Minister has not made sufficient budgetary provision for their all round  development in relation to their population. I would like to request the hon.  Minister to get the students belonging to SCs and STs Communities admitted  in schools and colleges at zero balance to provide them better education. A  majority of weavers live in my Parliamentary Constituency. They were getting  30 per cent subsidy on cotton and electricity but the same has now been  discontinued. The Atmanirbhar Bharat  Budget allocated Rs.2,23,486 crore to create health infrastructure which is  highly appreciable.  Allocation of Rs.36,000 crore for COVID-19 vaccine is a  welcome feature.  I request the Government to give this vaccine free to the  poor people.  So far as my State of Andhra Pradesh is concerned, some of  the basic grants and performance related grants under the 14th and 15th  Finance Commissions amounting to Rs.1,842 crore are pending.  I request  the Central Government to release the grants.  I request the Central  Government to release Rs.2,255 crore from NDRF.  MGNREGS is the single  largest means of livelihood for the poor unskilled labour in rural areas.  An  amount of Rs.3707 crore pending on account of material component should  be released to the State.  I also request the Central Government to increase  the number of working days from 100 to 150. In the time of pandemic, an overall  allocation of Rs.2,23,846 crore for health is an appreciable step.  Allocation of  Rs.35,000 crore for COVID-19 vaccination shows that the Government is on  the right track.  Allocation to capital expenditure of Rs.5,54,336 crore will  create source of strength to the economy in the coming years.  Higher  allocation to the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry  of Jal Shakti is a much appreciable act.  Extension of Operation Greens  scheme to another 22 perishable products, is a much-needed initiative.   Establishing 750 Eklavya Model Residential Schools in tribal areas will  certainly improve literacy and development of the tribal children.  In the  backdrop of pandemic, it is the responsibility of the Government to create  employment opportunities.  The allocation to MGNREGS needs to be  increased.  Allocation to MSME sector needs to be increased.  There is a  need to enhance allocation for the education.  The decrease in the allocation  for the Ministry of Women and Child Welfare  is not an appreciable thing.   Allocation of Rs.3415.60 crore for post-metric scholarships for the Scheduled  Caste students is well below expectations.  More allocation should be made to  rehabilitate the manual scavengers and create self-employment for them.   The proposal to Privatise the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) needs to be  withdrawn.  We also appeal to the Finance Minister to fulfil the promises made  to Andhra Pradesh in the AP Reorganisation Act. The Presidential Address has missed  out on several important issues. It ignores the aspirations of the People of  Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  While opposing it I demand that the budget  for Andaman & Nicobar Islands should be increased to Rs.10,000 crore and  incentives be given to promote fisheries, tourism and IT in the Island.  There  is a need to tackle unemployment and to clear the backlog of thousands of  government job vacancies in this Island.  Online recruitment for government  jobs should also be stopped here. Flat Bay water supply project and Rutland  Project should be implemented as early as possible to resolve the water crisis  in Andaman & Nicobar Island.   There is a need to establish a separate  commission for women also in this Island.  Today, not only India but the entire  world is facing economic slow down and corona has been the main reason for  the same. But despite the same Hon. Minister of Finance has presented a  good budget for making country\\u201fs infrastructure robust to enable a concrete  foundation and clean India. Before our Government came to power the entire  world used to laugh at India but during the last six years,  the entire world has  seen India rising , its image has improved , and our Honourable Prime  Minister has done the work for the same by focusing on strengthening every  village of the country and thereby empowering every farmer of the country.  The Union Government provides for Rupees 35 thousand 219 crore under  Post Matric  Scholarship Scheme for the welfare of Scheduled Castes and  Scheduled Tribes. There are around 7,000 mandis in the country. Mandi  Committee never dissolves. Mandis are  still functioning . The Congress Party  has not waived off even a single penny after collecting votes under the pretext  and sloganeering of false promises to waive off entire loans. My  Parliamentary Constituency is Sri Ganganagar and it is a border area .  Rupees 10 per litre increase in diesel has taken place in Punjab and Haryana  adjacent to my Parliamentary Constituency. I urge upon you to rectify the said  rate after consultation with State Governments . Diesel and Petrol are the  most expensive in my constituency Sri Ganganagar compared to the entire  country. If there is highest production of Kinnow in Asian continent, it is in Sri  Ganganagar. Through you, I urge the Government to fix MSP on Kinnow and  carrot on the lines of coconut. There is always a shortage of canal water in  Rajasthan. Rajasthan is still not getting full supply of water. Kindly ensure that  Rajasthan gets its fair share of water. In the President's address there is  no mention about development-oriented works for the deprived sections of  scheduled castes, tribes and backward, poor and also two districts of  Shravasti and Balrampur from Uttar Pradesh \\u2013 lacking basic infrastructure like  clean and potable water, high and quality education. Our party condemns the  incident of violent assault and insult of the tricolor on the occasion of Republic  Day. I urge upon the Government to withdraw the three controversial bills  meant for farmers and resolve the issue and provide the permanent  procurement centers to benefit  the farmers, to facilitate them to sell their  produce any time under the prescribed price. At least 20 lakh rupees per  farmer should be provided to the family of the farmers who lost their lives in  the farmers' movement, as well as a government job to each member of such  family. There is no mention about the development work in the region, in the  absence of MPLAD fund.  I urge upon the Government to provide funds for  undertaking the development work.  I appreciate the attitude of  the Government towards facing COVID-19 challenges and bringing down the  number of cases and providing vaccination to more than 65 lakh people. I also  thank the hon. Finance Minister for helping us in getting revised estimate for  Polavaram Project.  As regards GST collections, Andhra Pradesh stands first  in the entire country during Covid-19 period also.  It stands second in  commerce and industry.  A lot of funds related to MGREGA are pending with  various Departments of the Central Government. I request the Government to  release the pending dues of Rs. 4282 crore to the Government of Andhra  Pradesh for rice distribution through the Public Distribution System and   provide  revenue deficit which has been caused by the 14th Finance  Commission which comes to Rs 18,830 crore.  Assistance for Nivar Cyclone  under NDRF and Development assistance to the backward districts should  also be provided.   I urge the Government to immediately accord special  category status to the State of Andhra Pradesh and accord sanction to  Ramayapatnam Port in place of Dugarajapatnam Port.  There is a need to  implement all schemes and projects under AP Reorganisation Act. I request  the Government to release all funds pending for the welfare schemes and  various projects pertaining to the state.  I request the hon. Finance Minister to  rethink, restructure and recalibrate Vizag Steel Project.  There is a need to  restructure mining sector in the state.   The tax slab of GST should be  reduced from 18% as it is very high and some kind of relief in regard to GST  has to be given to the contractors doing work for the State Government and  the Central Government.   The Government has to rethink on MSME sector  and provide stimulus package to them.  New railway lines, RUBs and ROBs  are required to be built in Andhra Pradesh with 100 percent support from the  Central Government. As far as individual income tax is concerned, some kind  of relief should be provided to middle class and upper middle class people.   My final point is about the MPLADS which should continue as without these  funds, we are unable to do any projects in our constituencies. Considering the situation  prevailing due to Covid- 19 epidemic, the hon. Finance Minister, while paying  attention towards the poor and upper class people provided economic  package.  Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana and funding for \\u201cAatmanirbhar  Bharat\\u201d is commendable.  The names of cities of Bihar and other states  should be included in Jan Jeevan Mission.  The flow of river Ganga should be  restored. The assistance should be provided to Bihar for damage caused due  to flood occurred in 2020.  The funds recommended in the Interim Report of  the 15th Finance Commission should be provided to the state of Bihar.   A  textile park should be set up in Bihar.  All the cities of Bihar should be  included in the City Gas Distribution Network.  The Government\\u201fs plan to  disinvest Indian Companies should be reconsidered and all sick institutions  should be revived.  Fertilizer factory located at Barauni, Bihar and railway  factory at Dalmia Nagar of Rohtas should be made functional.   Instead of  assembling engine parts, all parts should be manufactured in Electric rail  engine factory located at Madhepura of Bihar. Chhapra\\u201fs wheel factory should  also be commissioned.  The plan to transfer Jamalpur loco shed should be  discontinued. The railway factories of Mokama, Samastipur and Muzaffarpur  should be made functional.  All these schemes will help in the development of  Bihar.  The Government talks about doubling the income of the farmers.  Hence it should provide interest free loans to them for purchasing agricultural  implements and machinery.  The Government should help the farmers in  selling their crops at fixed MSP so that they may get fair price.  The  Government should waive off their earlier loans also. The Government should  make an announcement to provide uniform monthly pension of atleast Rs.  3000/- to older persons in the country irrespective of their class.  Fisheries  centres should be opened in Saharsa, Bihar where farming is not possible  due to flood waters of river Kosi.  We demand that a Sainik School should be  set up at Kosi sub-divisional Headquarter of Saharsa.   The number of cancer,  heart disease, kidney and liver patients is increasing day by day in Saharsa- Madhepura areas of Bihar.  The Government should also find out the reasons  for such increase in the number of cases.  A new AIIMS should be set up in  Saharsa.  I demand that sanction may be accorded for setting up Kendriya  Vidyalaya in my Madhepura Parliamentary Constituency. Vaishali Express  and Humsafar train should be extended upto Madhepura District Headquarter  for the facility of the people.   I request the Government that MPLAD funds  should not be discontinued. A new railway line should be constructed from  Saharsa to Bhagalpur to facilitate the people of those areas. I am happy that the Union  Government has presented the Budget 2021-22 in digital form for the first  time.  We welcome the step for giving higher priority to health sector and  drinking water but reduction in allocation for women and child development,  National Education Mission and PMGSY would affect the implementation.  We  appeal to the Government to increase the allocation.  Budget focus on capital  investment and MSME sector will help in revival of economy and employment  generation.  Odisha was the first to establish one of the country\\u201fs biggest  1,000-bedded dedicated COVID-19 hospital in a record time of just one week.   I, appeal to the hon. Prime Minister and hon. Finance Minister to consider our  demands to make amendment in Central Sales Tax Act, 1956; provision of  Rs. 7,200 crore for Railway Projects; banks at Gram Panchayat level,  provision of Rs. 5,650 crore for providing telecom connectivity to rural and  interior areas, adequate funds to the Ministry of Road Transport and  Highways etc.     The rail density in the Odisha State should be increased.  Importance  should be given to the quality of National Highways in Odisha.  To Boost  tourism a Jagannath International Airport in Puri should be set up.  We need  more funds to pay unemployment allowance to workers engaged under the  Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act for the job  losses caused by COVID-19 lockdown GST on tendu leaves should be  reduced from 18 per cent to five per cent.  I urged upon the Government of  India to explore the possibility for availing of Local Currency Loan in INR  instead of LIBOR- based dollar-denominated loan from the World Bank and  the ADB. The budget has not provided any  special benefit to common people, working class, middle class and house  wives. It is my request to the Government to increase health budget and to  reduce the price of diesel and petrol. In this budget, the valuable assets of the  country such as rail, airport, LIC, roads, electricity, warehouses etc are being  sold. The Government has reduced around six thousand crores in the  education budget. The allocation for scholarship given to SC, ST and OBC  has also been reduced in the Central budget. I request to provide scholarship  to SC, ST and OBC as earlier. Thousands of people migrate from my  Parliamentary Constituency for employment. The number of people migrating  from my parliamentary constituency Lalganj will decrease with the setting up  of a industry or factory in Lalganj. I request to construct direct rail line from  Banaras to Azamgarh via Lalganj at the earliest. The poor people are still  deprived of the benefit of 'Ayushman Bharat Yojana'. It is my request to the  Government to implement the said scheme at the earliest. Every important point has been  taken into consideration in this budget. Gas pipeline connectivity is being  given in the urban areas and 100 new cities will be connected to this gas  pipeline. There is a large tribal area in my Lok Sabha constituency, where  more than seven lakh tribal students and people live. Amravati is our  divisional headquarters. Two public health units, two public emergency  operation centers and a mobile hospital should be established here. A  hospital should be opened exclusively for women in my area. My district  Vidarbha comes under severe drought zone. Therefore, I request to provide a  fund of 100 crore rupees under Jal Jeevan Mission to provide water  connection in every house. Cotton production is very high in Vidarbha region.  Therefore, a textile park should be set up in Amravati to help cotton growing  farmers. There are 24 tribal areas in my district where there is no light facility.  Light should be arranged here. The metropolitan municipality Amravati should  be connected to the city gas distribution network to facilitate women. Two  Eklavya schools should be set up in Anjangaon and Surji in our area. One of  the 100 Sainik Schools declared in the budget should be given in our  Amravati district. Attention should be paid to Bharat Dynamics Limited project.  Approval has been received for conversion of Akola, Akot, Telai, Dhulghat,  Dhabka, Khandwa railway line to broad gauge. This line should be made  operational as soon as possible. MPLAD Fund should also be made available  to all Members of Parliament this year. This budget has the perception of reality  as well as the trust of development. It has also the vision of  self-reliance and  all-round  development . Villages and farmers are in the centre of this budget.  It is aimed at generating employment opportunity. It has  the target of opening  one hundred new Sainik schools in education sector. Crores of families have  availed the benefits of Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana. The amount of Rs. 500  has been credited regularly in bank accounts to each  of the poor women for  three months. The hon'ble  Prime Minister of our country has provided the  facility of toilet to crores of  the families in the country. This is for the first time  when the hon'ble  Prime Minister has expressed his concern to increase the  income of the farmers. The Union Government will send the amount of Rs.  65000 crore in farmers' accounts. Hon'ble Modi ji has expressed concern over  the pension to the farmers. The  provision of Rs. 350000  crore has been  made for Covid vaccine. Aatma Nirbhar Swasth Bharat Yojana has been  announced in this budget. Crores of such families have been provided   houses in India. For my constituency I would like to make a demand of road  providing connectivity to the districts of three Lok Sabha constituencies- Gwalior,Bhind and Etawah. This road is required to be upgraded by making it  six-lane road. Bhind  is  a district falling under my parliamentary constituency.  This is the most backward district. I have a demand of opening a medical  college over there. If Government would have introduced  agriculture Bills with consent of farmers' Union and farmers it would have  brought cheers throughout the country and the agitation that is going on  presently,  would not have started. Government must think about these  agitating farmers. During Corona period , their crops and milk all were  spoiled. After conducting the survey of their loss, Government should give  monetary assistance to the farmer so that they could feel a sense of  belongingness with the Government. There are three Commissionerates  in  my constituency i.e. Meerut ,Muzaffarnagar  and Bijnor. I want that a Central  School should be opened in Bijnor, Sainik School should be opened  in  Muzaffarnagar and a training centre  should be set up  in the capital of  Western Uttar Pradesh i.e. Meerut and farmers should be trained there   for  doubling of their income.  Gujjar community is also a  brave community and  have always sacrified their lives for the nation. There are a number of  languages spoken on Jammu and Kashmir border like Dogari,Punjabi and  Urdu so, I request that Gurjari should also be included in the list of states  languages. The President's Address contains a  complete outline of the work done by the Government. The steps taken by the  Government to overcome the Corona crisis have also been mentioned in his  Address.  The whole world was looking at the country as to what India would  do to protect its 130 crore people from the Corona.  We have been trying to  get out of this problem since last one year. Both the state and the central  Governments have worked together to save the people from Corona.  Hon.  Prime Minister and the Chief Ministers of the States have worked for the  welfare of people.  We express our gratitude to them.  Today, we can proudly  raise our heads with pride all over the world and say that made in India  vaccine has become a reality now.  This made in India vaccine has been  manufactured in Hyderabad. So, it is a matter of great pride for our Telangana  also.  I would also like to say that we should provide this vaccine free of cost  to the poor people.  Hob\\u201fble President has also mentioned about the farmers  in his Address.  There are 80 per cent small and marginal farmers in our  country.  The Pradhan Mantri Samman Nidhi Yojana has been implemented  to provide assistance to all of them. I would also like to say that the farmers  should also be provided with electricity 24 hours a day.  Thus, villages should  be developed as Adarsh grams.  Similarly, free drinking water scheme is a  very good scheme.  At the sametime, I would also like to say that the  Women's Reservation Bill should be brought for the welfare of women.   Moreover, a scheme should also be brought for the welfare of the poor girls  across the country.  At the same time, I request that the demand for setting up  of Tribal University, steel plant, IIM, ISAR, regional ring-road, railway projects,  new airports, Navodya Vidyalayas in Telangana should also be met at the  earliest. Sir, I rise to support the motion of thanks on  hon'ble President's Address.  The year 2020 was full of challenges for the entire  world including India. On the one hand there was Corona crisis and earthquake,  attack of locusts, bird flu, tension along Chinese border on the other. But the way  government dealt with them is commendable.  During lockdown workers have to  face the problem of livelihood. But our government provided free foodgrains to  them for a period of 8 months.  Several vaccines have been developed in the  country at a very low cost to check corona virus. Our government announced  biggest ever economic package to bring economy on the track. I am pained to  see that certain farmers unions are carrying out agitation.  Our government has  launched various schemes for the farmers like soil health card, Pradhan Mantri  Fasal Bima Yojna, National Agricultural Market, e-NAM and particularly Kisan  Samman Scheme under which Rs. 6000/- per year is provided to the farmers.  Direct rail service from Jalore to Delhi or Jaipur is not available for the people of  this area even about ten years after broad-gauge conversion. Keeping in view  the problems of the citizens of this area there is a need to start a train from  Gandhidham to Delhi via Jalore (Samdari Bhildi). Sirohi district of my  Parlimentary Constituency is still not connected with rail network. Sirohi district  centre be connected with rail network through Marwad Bagra and Pindwara  route.  There is a need to connect Sirohi district Centre with Marwad, Bagra  Pindwara to Udaipur with rail line. About seven lakh people from Jalore Sirohi live  in various cities of South India. But these migrants have to face many difficulties  as there is no direct rail service.  So Jalore to Palanpur, Bangaluru to Jodhpur via  Samdari Bhildi, Coimbatore to Jodhpur via Samdari Bhildi, Hyderabad to Jodhpur  via Samdari Bhildi, and Chennai to Jodhpur via Samdari Bhildi be connected with  direct train services.  Rohit-Aroh-Jalore-Bhimnal-Karda-Sanchore road be  constructed at the earliest. There is a need to declare Jherda to Siroha road (via- Revdar and by pass at Mandar) as National Highway and construct it.  There is a  need to set up a medical college at Jalore district centre.  Under Udaan Scheme  there is a need to start air service from Manpur air strip located at Sirohi. There is  a need to connect both the districts Jalore and Sirohi with Atal Bhujal Yojna. Today country is witnessing all round  development in all sectors. 80 crore people have been provided 5 kg food  grain for 8 months free of cost under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan  Yojana. It is a commendable initiative. Hon. Chief Minister Shri Nitish Kumar  has launched Jal Jivan Hariyali Abhiyan for maintaining environmental  balance. I urge upon the Government of India to implement Jal Jivan Hariyali  Abhiyan along with Jal Jivan Mission. Bihar is moving ahead on the path of  development with the implementation of various schemes for the welfare of  women, students and senior citizens. The concept of Sabka Saath, Sabka  Vikas, Sabka Vishwas is being materialized through Atma Nirbhar Bharat  Abhiyan. The Government provided 80 crore people  with additional 5 kg. free food grains per month for eight months.  It launched  several schemes like Svanidhi for street vendors and hawkers, the Garib  Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyan.  Programmes like Ayushman Bharath, PMB Jana  Aushadhi Yojana met the challenges in pandemic times.  The three important  farm laws need necessary amendments.  I am thankful to the Prime Minister  for sanctioning the Kisan Rail.  To fulfill the dreams of Baba Saheb Ambedkar,  allocations to Jal Jeevan Mission need to be enhanced.  Schemes like  Suvidha Scheme, Rashtriya Poshana Abhiyaan, Atal Bhujal Yojana Scheme  are welcome.  Opening of 400 Ekalavya Model Residential Schools for  Divyangjans are really appreciable.  Safety of women must be given priority.   My state Andhra Pradesh should be provided a special category status. We are now manufacturing  but earlier we were importing expensive ventilators. Today, India's vaccine  manufacturing capacity is a global asset. We were the quickest to reach three  million vaccination mark. Made in India vaccines are being shipped globally  from Bhutan to Brazil. Even my State of Andhra Pradesh has done  exceedingly well in these difficult times. The State of Andhra Pradesh has  been ranked the best State in terms of ease of doing business. The YSR  Congress Party has repeatedly raised the demand for a Special Category  Status to Andhra Pradesh. Polavaram irrigation project is the lifeline of Andhra  Pradesh. We have repeatedly asked for the clearance of revised cost  estimate of Rs. 55,000 crore. I request the Union Government to release  these grants immediately. Andhra Pradesh is a revenue deficit State but  energy surplus State. President in his Address has mentioned about Adarsh  Gram. This is the vision of Mahatma Gandhi. Andhra Pradesh wants to  achieve this dream through free and fair panchayat elections.   I  pay my tribute to the people died due  to  the glacier burst in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand.  Several people are still  missing there. Secondly millions of people have died due to Corona pandemic.  Winter Session of  Lok Sabha could not be convened due to Corona pandemic.  This time, inspite of Corona pandemic, all parties have certainly given a good  message. The farmers' movement has been going on for last 90 days. It is the  largest peaceful movement and it has become a mass movement. This  movement is not restricted to just six states, it is the movement of the whole  country. I demand that all three black agricultural laws should be repealed. I  demand that the Government should accept all the main demands of the farmers  and implement the entire report of the Swaminathan Commission. My main  demand from the Government is that there should be a law guaranteeing the  minimum support price for agriculture produce.  The farmers of the country also  want this and the Government should talk to these farmers. The jawans of CRPF,  ITBP, BSF, etc. protect our borders as well as  fight against terrorism, separatism  and Naxalism. They also maintain law and order and help in conducting elections  in the country. But the irony is that inspite of all this, these jawans of para-military  forces are not given due importance.  Jawans of these para-military forces who  joined service after 2004, neither get pension, nor promotion and any other  benefit of social security schemes for ex-servicemen. I appreciate the initiatives taken by the  Government to develop indigenous vaccines, ventilators, PPE kits, etc., to fight  COVID-19 pandemic and for providing corona vaccine to other countries.   However, Government should provide it free of cost to all the Indian citizens.   Three farm laws were enacted last year but no consultation was held with the  stakeholders before enacting these three legislations which affect millions of  farmers.    Kerala is producing 90 per cent of the natural rubber in the country.    Rubber producers in Kerala are not getting adequate price for their produce vis- \\u00e0-vis the cost of production.  I urge upon the Government to fix the minimum  price of natural rubber at Rs. 200 per kilogram.  The misuse of laws such as  UAPA, NSA, etc., are used to suppress the voice of genuine human rights  activists, such as the arrest of tribal rights activist Jesuit priest Father Stan  Swamy.  I request the hon. Home Minister to intervene and release this old priest  who has spend his life for the upliftment of the Adivasis.  Our Samajvadi Party is with the  farmers and presently this country is struggling and it is in sympathy with the  farmers. The government should withdraw the three Acts that have been passed  against the farmers, only then there can be peace and brotherhood in the  country. Hon. President's Address has made no  mention about the working class or the problems faced everyday by the country  or the laws of the government providing solution to such problems. On the  contrary, this Address is just like a political campaign with lots of praises for the  ruling Party. Farmers' protests are being held for the last two and half months  along the borders of Delhi. Our Hon. Prime Minister has made his observations  about theses protestors which are demeaning. He called them as \\\"Andolan  Jeevi\\\". I strongly condemn the act of demeaning the protestors by Hon. Prime  Minister Respecting the sentiments of the people, the Government should take  back or withdraw these three farm laws. I also urge that a law should be enacted  so as to ensure Minimum Support Price. The Government of Srilanka has  recently accorded permission to the Chinese Government for setting up of power  generation projects in islands like Neduntheevu, Nainatheevu and Analaitheevu. I  urge that the Indian Government should work towards stopping the grant of  permission by the Government of Srilanka as regards the power projects in these  islands around Indian sub-continent. I urge upon the Indian Government that it  should raise at the UNHRC meeting, the issues relating to judicial action against  the perpetrators of war crimes and genocide in Srilanka. Brahmaputra is the lifeline of Assam and  North-Eastern India.  It has tributaries.  It causes flood every year.  We co-exist  with the flood.  But there are lots of problems created by soil erosion before and  after the flood.  The Government should have a policy to control soil erosion.  Various areas of Bamun Dongra, Baghbore and Jogighopa are affected by soil  erosion.  The scheme to control soil erosion caused by Beki and Brahmaputra  should be passed.  There is erosion by Aie and Manas in Bongaigaon district of  North Salmara division. There is a great protest of Citizenship Amendment Act  held in Assam.  Minorities are persecuted in Bangladesh, Pakistan and  Afghanistan.  We are always in favour of their protection.  All the organisations  and the political parties agreed to provide protection to those migrated before the  year 1971 and those who came after the year 1971 will be expelled from there.  Inner line permit should be enforced in Assam.  Express highway should be  constructed on either side of the river Brahmaputra. COVID-19 vaccination programme in India is a  daunting task  and matter of great pride. COVID-19 pandemic has shown the  urgent need to ramp up medical infrastructure in the country. We need a  second AIIMS in Odisha, in Sundergarh  and NIMHANS at Ranpur. We really  need  to ramp  up and decentralise the vaccination programme. We have  almost 82 lakh vaccination sites in this country for the universal immunisation  programme. There is a lot of vaccination hesitancy. I believe personally that  top leadership must come forward and get vaccinated. An impartial inquiry  should be conducted in the matter what happened  on  Republic Day at the  Red Fort and those who are responsible must be dealt with the most firm  manner possible. At the same time the sight of concertina wires, spikes and  concrete boulders on the road, is not a happy sight in Gandhi\\u2018s India .The  Government should ensure and find out solution to problems of  farmers. The  Swaminathan Committee recommendations must be implemented in toto.   Numerous difficulties faced by the country like Covid-19,  floods, cyclones,  etc. Odisha has borne a significant brunt of the damage caused by these  cyclones and floods. Special Focus Status\\u2018 must be there for States like  Odisha which are continuously facing natural disasters. Deogarh, Boudh,  Sonepur, Kandhamal, Nabrangpur, and Malkangiri, which are tribal and  Maoist-infested districts and need rail connectivity. I feel that the Women\\u2018s  Reservation Bill must be passed. For the last nine to ten  consecutive months, the entire world has been facing global epidemic. This  pandemic seems to be having comparatively lesser impact in our country than  other countries. The Indians faced this epidemic by following all the guidelines  given by the government and it seems that they are on verge of gradually and  steadily conquering this abnormal situation. During the Corona epidemic, our  government launched the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyan, especially for the  workers of five-six states who returned to the villages from the cities. Under  this new campaign a large amount of employment equal to 50 crore work  days has been created. All the new construction facilities, which had been  created by our government in the last five years, had a direct and immediate  result during this corona epidemic, due to which we fought this epidemic in the  country. I request the government, through this, to complete the pending  irrigation projects in my area at the earliest. To make the agriculture sector  more profitable, our government has set up an agriculture infrastructure fund  worth Rs 1 lakh crore to further strengthen agriculture infrastructure and  agriculture sector. Under this agricultural infrastructure fund, I urge the  government to build a cold storage for the banana cultivators in my area, and  to set up a research institute to make thread from banana bole/stem and the  environment friendly de-composable and disposable items from banana  leaves, which will create a new dimension for the youth of my region and this  will also contribute to the creation of new employment opportunities. In order  to recharge the land artificially in my Raver Lok Sabha Constituency, I  demand the government to construct the Mega Recharge Scheme at the  earliest, which is the first and pilot project of its kind to be set up in the country  through the Central Ground Water Board. All the Municipal Councils of my  constituency are also waiting for grants under PM Shari Awas Yojana, and I  request the government to release them immediately. My Lok Sabha  Constituency tops in banana production in the country, so through this, I  demand to create alternative farming measures to promote organic farming  alongwith cluster-based plantation. This Session began after two  hard times.  Farmers were sitting in the cold at the border of Delhi.  There was  no facility.  If the ruling party wanted, it could be decided by talking to them a  little bit.  The Government has announced to double the income of farmers by  the year 2022.  But, the income of farmers will not double if the farmers do not  go to the fields. So, if the Government wants, as soon as the motion of thanks  on President address is passed, the people of the ruling and opposition  parties should go and convince those farmers, then I know that some solution  will be found.  People are not getting opportunities because of Corona, people  are not getting work.  The paramedics who were given work during the  Corona epidemic, will also lose their jobs.  That is why I want the Government  to take such a step so that those whose jobs are about to go can get some  work.  I have come to know that new Sainik schools are about to open.  A new  school should be opened in my Satara district and keeping in mind the  financial problems of the schools that are running there, some efforts should  be made.  There is a double line from Pune to Londa, but it has not been  electrified.  Marathi is our mother tongue.  It should be given the status of  classical language. In the last quarter of 2020- 21, the prices of petrol and diesel were increased drastically, therefore, the  Centre should consider reducing the excise duty on petrol and diesel. Given  the large-scale protests by farmers, these farm laws must be withdrawn and  new Bills must be drafted taking into consideration the farmers\\u2018 concerns and  demands with the promise of continuation of MSP for farmers. I urge that the  MSP recommended by the Swaminathan Committee is to be calculated using  the more comprehensive C2 cost formulae and not the A2+FL formulae used  by the Centre. If we are to ensure sufficient supply of grains to the needy  poor, under-privileged and marginalised sections, food grains above the  minimum buffer requirement with the FCI must be mandated to be released  during times of grain shortage and price rise. The compensation arrear for all  States combined was Rs. 1,51,365 crore and delay in the devolution of funds  from the Centre has severely limited the States\\u2018 ability to spend on their  welfare and development including keeping COVID-19 under control. The  Centre must clearly specify the timeline by when it will transfer the GST  compensation cess to states.  I would like to question the   Centre as to what tangible results have been achieved so far through \\u2017Make in  India\\u2018 initiative and efforts being taken to make the Indian defence  manufacturing companies self-reliant in manufacture of advanced aircraft  (technical know-how) and to further the technological advancement at  Hindustan Aeronautical Limited (HAL) and other defence public sector  enterprises. I urge the Centre to consult all the stakeholders before drafting  policies and uphold the federal structure of our economy. Hon. President has mentioned about  the construction of a new Parliament Building in his Address.  It is a matter of  pride but keeping in view the priority of the country, I request the Government  to reconsider its priorities, our first priority should be hospitals and only then  new building of Parliament should be constructed.  As such, no one has made  demand for construction of new building of this Parliament, but demand for  development works in every Parliamentary Constituency under MPLAD Fund  is being made.  So I request the Government to restore the MPLAD fund  immediately.  Coordination between the central and state Government has  also been mentioned in the Address.  An amount of  Rs. 25,000/-  crore of  GST  is yet to be released to Maharashtra Government.  It should be released  immediately.  This Government had promised to provide employment to  two  crore youth  every year but instead they lost their jobs.  There is mention of  Atmnirbhar Bharat, self reliant India in the Address.   Everyone felt proud when  this Government said that  it won\\u2018t be let this at stake.  The future generations will  never forgive us if  under the guise of a free economy, we promote crony capitalism  and hand over the resources of the country to a few selected capitalists. There is  mention of a number of schemes for farmers but our farmers are staging protest at  borders of Delhi.  Violence cannot and should not be supported, but the conspiracy  to defame the movement is condemnable.  I would request the Government to solve  this problem sympathetically in the interest of farmers. We are discussing the  Major Port Autorities Bill, 2020. I understand that there is a need for improving the  management of major ports. The Bill adopts a three-step approach to achieve its  objective. First step is through a Board representing the Centre, the States,  Railways, Defence, Customs and independent members. Second step is by giving  greater autonomy to this Board to make master plans. Third step is by creating  transparency in the functioning of the ports. It is literally taking away the  involvement of the State Government from the Central Government wherein the  Board can actually decide on development of the port\\u2019s master plan and  everything. So, we have to take States\\u2019 interest also into consideration. The  fishermen and the communities which are dependent on the inland waterways have  to be taken into consideration. A pilot project can be taken up by the Government  in Visakhapatnam under the Sagarmala Project. We as the YSR Congress Party  repeat our support for this Bill. It has been observed that there was no  specific Act passed by the Parliament or State Assembly for taking the promoters  of such chit fund companies to task or to stop them from collecting money from  poor investors against promise of lucrative returns.  Initially in 2003, the West  Bengal State Assembly passed a draft Act and sent it to the Centre for assent.  But  the assent was not given.  Since then, on different occasions in 2013 and 2014, the  State Government of West Bengal communicated with the Central Government in  this regard.  In 2014, the Central Government again raised certain points.  The  State Government incorporated those points and passed the Protection of Interest  of Depositors in Financial Establishment Bill, 2013.  But, finally in 2015 that Bill  was enacted.  I would like to inform that the State Government of West Bengal  prepared a specific scheme for payment of compensation to the depositors in  distress and an amount of Rs.500 crore was earmarked for this purpose.  It was  known to everyone that a writ petition was filed in Sarada matter and it was  investigated by the CBI.  But the question is why till now charge sheets have not  been filed?   In the background of the fact that this august House has already  passed the Banking Unregulated Deposit Scheme Bill, 2019, is there any necessity  to continue with the Chit Funds Act?  I suggest the Government to scrap it as all  these provisions have already been in that Act.  Chit fund gives an incorrect  impression to the common people.  If chit funds are valid and ponzi schemes are  invalid, then how will the common people be able to make the distinction about  investing in chit funds or investing in ponzi schemes?   The investigation conducted so far puts a question mark on the role of regulatory  authorities like SBI, Registrar of Companies and officials of RBI.  The synopsis  goes to the extent of suggesting that regular payments towards bribe were paid  through middlemen to some of those who were supposed to keep an eye on such  ponzi companies.  This breach of the law, therefore, needs to be closely examined  and effectively dealt with.  My question to the Hon. Minister is as to why not a  single person from the regulatory agencies was not called for interrogation?  I will  ,therefore, request the Hon. Finance Minister to please finish the trial at the  earliest. People are being duped for a long  time by the chit fund companies in the entire country.  People have lost even their  lives owing to these companies.  During the past few years, several chit scams and  bank scams have come to the light and in these scams, mostly ordinary people like  pensioners, employees, small businessmen, farmers etc. have lost their deposits.   Today, money of ordinary people is not safe anywhere.  Several chit fund scams  have been unearthed in Maharashtra also.  In Nasik, an individual called  Bhausaheb Chavhan committed a chit fund scam to the tune of rupee ten thousand  crore.  Likewise, an individual called Mahesh Motiwar ran a scheme title  \\u201eSamriddh Jivan\\u201f in Pune.  Under this scheme, a scam of rupees four thousand and  five hundred crore was committed.  More than 180 complaints have been received  relating to scams of chit fund in Maharashtra.  The Government ought to take note  of these complaints and quick action should be taken against these chit fund  companies. Taking advantage of low  financial literacy and greed of people looking for higher returns on their  investments, many fraudulent chit fund companies have collected huge amounts of  money and vanished.  There is still no law that can recover the investors' money.   The existing legislation come into play after a fraud has occurred.  But by that time  the offenders will escape, leaving the chit fund investors in lurch.  Unless the focus  is on implementation without political interference and strengthening of the  judicial mechanism, any amendment to the law is not going to be of much help to  the poor.  With a reported 10,000 chit fund companies running in the country  handling over Rs. 30,000 crore annually, these funds are an important financial  tool for the growth of the Indian economy.  The current GST rate is 12 per cent  which is burdensome and it is requested that GST may completely be waived off  up to Rs. 50 lakh as regards chit funds.  There is a dire need to set up a Regulatory  Authority at the Central level and Regulatory Boards at the State level.  The  Registrar of Companies has to take immediate steps to register all the unregistered  chit companies running in the country. Today we want to attach the  property of the Chit Fund owners to return the money to the investors. But  actually, the money is with the agents. Today, police officials, political leaders, all are involved in the scams. We want the main culprits, the kingpins of the scams to  be arrested. The new legislation is all right, but first the law should be enacted for  the common people who have lost everything. We want to know how their issues  are addressed. Today lakhs of people who used to work in the hotels, resorts,  production houses run by the chit fund owners have become jobless. So we want  that the new Bill should be passed in this House. I do not believe that removal  of Article 370 would improve the level of education in any way.  The insurgency  in Jammu and Kashmir is related to economics.  Unemployment is one of the  biggest challenges there.  The hon. Prime Minister two years ago worked out the  framework with NSCN and they said that the State is unique and it has a different  history.  So, what is really the Government's line?  What would it be for Naga  framework?  My only humble question to you is when will you have elections  which are fair and transparent in Jammu and Kashmir.  As far as Ladakh is  concerned, it should also have an assembly.  We have supported dividing States  several times, but there has to be a way.  The Constitution is there to follow it.  The  Government must make sure that people in the valley feel safe. The Supreme Court  (Number of Judges) Amendment Bill, 2019 is a small but a  very important Bill.   Inadequate strength of judges was a major reason for backlog of cases.  There is  still a shortage of about 5,132 judges which led to a huge increase in the number of  pending cases in lower courts.   As the Hon. Minister has said there are many other  factors also such as frequent adjournments, indiscriminate use of writ jurisdiction,  vacation period of courts etc. which are causing pendency of cases in High Courts  and lower courts.  I would like to request the Hon. Minister to take immediate steps  to do away with these factors for early disposal of cases.  I would also like to  request the Hon. Minister to appoint more judges in the High Court of my State  Andhra Pradesh as many cases come from the High Court of Telangana to Andhra  Pradesh.   The Central Government had said that it would provide financial aid for  the welfare of advocates.   The Government should provide a common insurance  policy or separate policies for covering accidental and natural deaths in the  families of advocates. This type of Bill  should be realistic, pragmatic and difficult to circumvent and it should help the  genuinely needy persons.  I request the hon. Minister to widen the scope of clause  4 of the Bill.  My humble submission is that provision of an egg or sperm donor  should be incorporated in the Bill. Secondly, five years waiting period is too long  and it runs counter to right to reproductive autonomy.  As per the WHO standards,  after one year of married life, the couple should be considered infertile.  In fact in a  society like ours five year's wait may lead to divorce or second marriages and  disturb our social fabric.  Besides, the term 'close relative' has to be clearly defined.   I would request the hon. Minister to widen the scope of surrogacy to members of  the LGBT community, widows, divorcees, overseas citizens of India and to the  PIOs. I am supporting this Bill which has been  brought regarding increasing the strength of the Judges.  As on 1st July, 2019, even  in the hon. Supreme Court, number of pending admission matters were 38,982 and  complete miscellaneous matters were 25,419.  As on June 28, 2018, 3.3 crore  litigations are pending in the entire country.  Now I come to quality of the judges. I  saw judges spending hardly two or three minutes for taking admission of a matter.  Now the judges are taking 45 minutes or an hour for admission of matters.  This  speaks of the quality of lawyers who are being elevated as judges.  If you want to  pick up brilliant lawyers, then do not wait up till 45 years.  The second point  relates to behavior of the judges.  Behavior of some of the judges is really  shocking.  They do not treat the lawyers as lawyers.   There are recommendations  of collegiums for appointment of the judges.  One of the lawyer\\u2019s case in Calcutta  High Court, who had been recommended two years back, is still pending before the  Central Government.  If you want to have an independent Judiciary, please stop  giving appointments not only to retired judges but also to retired IAS officers and  retired IPS officers.  Everywhere vacancies are being increased.  Has the  Government ever thought how many Members of Parliament are now required  because of the increase in number of voters?  Only in the case of Members of  Parliament, there is no increase in strength.  In 1950, when the Supreme Court was  established, the strength of judges was eight. After this Bill has been passed, this  strength would be 34 which means more than 400 per cent increase.  But in case of  Members of Parliament, our strength is only 544. The Government should either  increase the strength of Members of Parliament or it should give them helping  hands. I want to bring this to the knowledge of the Central Government. I hope the  Government will hear it. I rise to support the Transgender Persons  (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2019.  The way this Government is making efforts to  provide proper education, healthcare facilities and employment opportunities to all  along with ensuring a quality and uncomplicated life for them irrespective of their  caste, religion and community shows that our Government is a sensitive  Government.  The transgender persons would constantly face discrimination right  from their home to the society.  So, the Supreme Court had issued directives direct  to the Central Government and the State Governments on 15th April 2014 to take  various steps for the welfare of the transgender community.  The Government has  defined the transgender persons and made a number of provisions for the  protection of their rights in this Bill.  We have taken a slew of measures to remove  the difficulties of the transgender children through this Bill.  The Bill provides for  27 such provisions that may facilitate the transgender persons to avail of the  benefits of all the schemes being implemented by the Union Government without  being subjected to any discrimination.  Our Government has decided to constitute a  National Council for the protection of the rights of the transgender persons.  Our  National Council has been entrusted with the task of preparing policies,  programmes, legislation and projects for the transgender persons.  A effort has also   been made to eliminate all sorts of discriminations in the matters of their education  and employment through this Bill.  Under this Bill, provision have been made to  issue certificates to transgender persons.  Our Government would provide the  benefits of welfare schemes to transgender persons without any discrimination.  I  would also like to request the Government to provide reservation benefits to  transgender persons in jobs.  Apart from that, facilities like housing, toilets,  electricity and cooking gas should be provided to these persons.  Our government  has made an endeavour to bring them into the mainstream of the society so that  their capabilities could be used in the nation building. It is a matter of immense pleasure for me that  most of the demands of the transgender persons have been incorporated in this Bill.   A demand was also made to bring a stringent law with regard to the cases of  harassment, rape and murder against transgender persons.  Similarly, there is also a  need to provide reservation in various sectors to these persons.  Moreover, people  need to change their view and inculcate positive feeling towards them.  Similarly,  arrangements should be made to provide education, job and skill development to  them.  A demand has also been made with regard to providing shelter for the  transgender persons who have been thrown out from their families.  Moreover,  instead of rehabilitation, focus should be given on their skill building and  providing them soft loans for entrepreneurship.  I would request that this Bill  should be passed unanimously. It is commendable that the Hon.  Minister has taken serious note of the shortage of judges and decided to increase  the number of judges in Supreme Court.  However, I would like to request the  Government that to sort out the problem of shortage of judges in the country the  retiring age of  Supreme Courts' judges can be raised from 65 years to 70 years and  for the judges of High Court it can be raised to 65 years.  Quality of judges should  also be maintained and justice should be delivered to the common man as early as  possible.  Lok Adalats are a good option.   I also request the Government that the  name of Bombay High Court should be changed to Mumbai  High Court.  There is  a long standing demand for Kolahapur High Court because people have to go to  Mumbai from Konkan in respect of their cases.  I request the Hon. Minister to  consider my demands sympathetically. This is an important Bill.  I would like to request  all the Members of this House to support this Bill.  My suggestion to the hon.  Minister is that the waiting time of five years after marriage should be minimized  to two years.  Further, the National Surrogacy Board should allow any friend of the  couples to become a surrogate mother. I want the Minister to  frame this Bill in such a way that it regulates rather than restricts the practice of  surrogacy.  The Bill should clearly define the term 'close relative' and this  restriction should be done away with.  Second, the provision of five years of  waiting period after the marriage should not be there in the Bill.  We should also  allow the people who are having same sex relationship of having a baby through  surrogacy.  The Bill should provide insurance cover for six years from the date of  confirmation of pregnancy.  The Bill also need to clarify as to how the NRIs, PIOs  and OCS card holders can go through this process. I would like that this Bill should be more stringent  in nature so that people do not misuse the practice of surrogacy.  This Bill intends  to support only those mothers who are sick and cannot conceive.  The practice of  surrogacy should not become an industry.  I thank the Government for bringing in  this Bill. Surrogacy is all about sacrifice and  happiness-sacrifice by a mother and happiness for a woman, who cannot become  mother.  However, it is unfortunate that India has become a surrogacy hub with  a  rise in unethical practices.  Therefore, the Government has come with the  Surrogacy Regulation Bill, 2019.  The path of surrogacy is adopted when women,  who have medical problems or are in such conditions that they cannot conceive.   At times, surrogacy is a great abiding solution even for those who are not able to  adopt a child because of their age or marital status.  This also includes the gays.   Where there is no biological connect, the Surrogate mother merely carries the baby  to term and delivers to the couple.  In the wake of the passage of the Bill, there  would be an effective check on the exploitation of women and the role of  intermediaries would be a thing of the past.  Further, as per the provisions of the  Bill Indian couples legally married for at least 5 years would be allowed to exhaust  the option of surrogacy.  However, there are a few concerns we need to look into.   In the first place, surrogate mothers should be adequately compensated for coupled  with proper strict rules in place lest it should be subjected to commercialization.  Moving further, in view of the reports of the failure of altruistic surrogacy in  several countries, I would like to urge upon the Minister to make the Bill more  inclusive and not to restrict it to close relatives alone. While the intended purpose of the Bill is  well founded, there are some issues that are missing.  As per the provision of the  Bill, the surrogate mother has to be a close relative of either of the two partners   whereas the term 'close relatives' remains undefined.  My suggestion is that even a  'close relative' chooses to be a surrogate mother, she should be adequately  compensated for.  Further, there is no mention of any specific time frame for  obtaining eligibility certificate from the competent authority by the intending  couple.  Besides, five years is a rather long period to be eligible, so it should be  reduced to 2 to 3 years.  Alongside,  transgenders including unmarried couples,  homosexual couples should also be included within the ambit of surrogacy.  More  importantly, couples with mentally or physically challenges child have been made  eligible to opt for surrogacy. It's not fair.  Last but not the least, complete ban on  commercial surrogacy would place surrogate mothers in a dangerous situation.  Therefore, I would urge upon the Minister to allow it on case to case basis subject  to close scrutiny of circumstances. Today, India is going to be  the hub of surrogacy at the global level which warranted some stringent legislation.   A lot of provisions have been made in the Bill to put a check on the  commercialisation of surrogacy.  However, I would like to strongly suggest to get  to the bottom of the problem and do the needful to fix the issue of infertility which  is on the rise for quite some time and can be largely attributed to air pollution,  water pollution,  lifestyle issues etc.  I hold the conviction that prevention is always  better than cure. Surrogacy is a viable option available to   women who are not able to conceive.  However, given the rampant  commercialisation of surrogacy, sale and purchase of human embryo and gamete  leading to potential exploitation of innocent and poor women, this Bill was  essentially called for.  Among the whole host of provisions contained in the Bill  what assumes greater significance is that a surrogate mother will be allowed to  enter into surrogacy only once in their life time.   This would put a severe check on  the alleged tendency of being lured to be a surrogate mother.  This apart, setting up  of a Surrogacy Board at the national level to regulate surrogacy is really a good  step in the right direction. Lastly, I would like to suggest that inclusion of the  provision of IVF and Donors' aids would prove to be very helpful. The present Bill is a welcome  effort on the part of the Government.  Regulating surrogacy is an urgent need and  the regulation of the same will go a long way in alleviating the difficulties faced by  the infertile couples.  But the Bill in the present form is thoroughly unrealistic and  self-defeating.  \\u2018Close relative\\u2019 is not defined in the Bill. Further, a close relative  surrogate may not be medically fit to be a surrogate mother.  Having a known  biological mother around is a serious issue and will have a bearing on the child  bonding with the intending parents, and it will surely impact the property rights  and succession laws. Hence, the word \\u2018close relative\\u2019 should be removed.   Altruistic surrogacy should be replaced with compensatory surrogacy as in the UK.   The modalities and terms of compensation may have to be worked out and  legalized.  The five-year duration after marriage is not correct particularly in those  cases where some congenital defects or serious medical disorders are present.  The  five-year wait clause has no meaning in cases where women are born without  uterus, that is congenital absence of uterus.  The insurance of the child born  through surrogacy should be included.  Maternity benefit should be given to the  altruistic surrogate mother if she is working, as per the Government law.  The law  should provide for surrogacy in legalized relationships as well.  The offence under  this Bill has been considered as cognizable, non-bailable and non-compoundable  which is too harsh and should be considered as non-cognizable offence only. Undoubtedly increasing the number of judges in  the Supreme  Court is  an urgent requirement and  I support this Bill.  However,  my concern is that as High Courts are the substratum of justice, it is important that  the  fearless and brilliant judges of High Court who form the bedrock of the pool  that come to the Supreme Court mostly on the very last day of their tenure at the  age of 62 years, should continue in High Courts. These extra three years that they  get when they come to the Supreme Court has made the race from the High Court  to the Supreme  Court which is totally undesirable. And unfortunately there is no  transparency in the entire collegium system and the system of appointment.  Many  High Court judges  would like to stay in High Courts only if they are in collegium  of the High Court or serving as the Chief Justice of the High Court rather than  joining the Supreme Court.  Therefore, the age of High Court judges should be  increased from 62 to 65 .  The Hon. Law Minister should consider it seriously.   Secondly, the National Judicial Appointment Commission has been struck down.  I  request the Government that this Commission should be brought back.  Lastly, I  believe that the time has come for bringing the National Judicial Service and the  entire House should support it.  It is the need of the hour.  I also feel that more  judges should be appointed from the SC/ST Communities. The problem of  opaqueness in  appointments can only be solved by a fresh National Judicial  Appointment Commission.   As the House is aware, 'justice  delayed is justice denied'.  I would, therefore, request that the number of Supreme  Court Judges may kindly be increased to, at least, 42 so that litigations can be  resolved expeditiously.  There is a dire need to set-up a Supreme Court Bench at  Hyderabad, which is the long-pending demand of the people, to provide timely  justice and to reduce the expenditure of the litigants.  Our hon. Chief Minister of  Telangana State, Shri K. Chandrasekhar Rao Garu is ready to extend full  cooperation and ensure adequate infrastructure required for running the Supreme  Court Bench at Hyderabad.  Post bifurcation of the Andhra Pradesh States,  Telangana High Court has a sanctioned strength at 24 Judges but it has on its rolls  only 12 Judges, which is just 50 per cent filled up. This Bill is an important  judicial reform and will assist in reducing the pendency of cases before the  Supreme Court, which is currently pegged at around 60,000. I request the  Government to make tenure appointments of retired apex court Judges and High  Court Judges under Articles 128 and 224A of the Constitution respectively to clear  backlog of cases pending for years.  I request the Government to bring a  Constitutional Amendment to increase the retirement age of High Court Judges  from 62 to 65 years.  At present, out of 1079 sanctioned posts, the actual Judges  are 673 which means, there is a vacancy of 406 Judges.  I also request that the  Bombay High Court should be renamed as Mumbai High Court.  There is one  other request pending which is the establishment of Kolhapur Circuit Bench. Our  hon.  Chief Minister has already taken initiative for that. As far as increasing the  number of Supreme Court Judges is concerned, it has been happening on a timely  manner.  Now, with the increase in the number of Judges by three, it is becoming  34 including the CJI.  There are a lot of cases which are waiting for justice in the  country.  The increase in the number of Supreme Court Judges will definitely help  in addressing that issue.  I would like to bring to the notice of the Government the  229th Law Commission Report which suggests that other than having the Supreme  Court sittings in Delhi, it needs to have other four Cassation Benches which need  to be set up in different regions of the country.  As my colleague from the TRS  Party has requested, one Bench can definitely be established in Hyderabad also.   There is a need to think over how to fill up the vacancies existing in the courts  across the country.  The retirement age for High Court Judges is 62 and the  retirement age for the Supreme Court Judges is 65.  I would also like to know from  the Government whether the Government is thinking of increasing age limit. This important Bill influences multipurpose  uses like irrigation, electricity generation, flood control, drinking water, industries  and storage of ground water. This law includes all the dams which have the height  of 10-15 meters and more.  This law gives the provision for the constitution of  National Dam Safety Committee, National Dam Safety Authority, State Dam  Safety Committee and State Dam Safety Organisation.  There are around 5,344 big  dams in the country in which around 293 dams are 100 years old or more.  1,041  dams are 50-100 years old. Around 40 dams are in a dilapidated state. Due to lack  of proper maintenance of dams in North Bihar, thousands of people are losing their  life every year.  Floods cause loss of life and property worth lakhs of rupees. The  excess water coming from Nepal during monsoon may be controlled and Bihar  should be saved from flood. According to the international policy, a treaty may be  signed between Nepal and Central Government for water. A high dam may be  constructed on Bihar-Nepal border. This will also help in the generation of  electricity and revenue as well. On the other side, Aurangabad, Sasaram,  Jahanabad, Nalanda, Arwal, Nawada and Sheikhpura districts in South Bihar are  facing drought due to the low rainfall by 36 per cent from average.  Immediate  action may be taken in order to free Bihar from its agonies by conducting a survey  of the flood and drought situation in Bihar.   I would say the Dam Safety Bill,  2019, which is before us today, is a much improved version of the Bill of 2010 that  was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee.  However, a number of  States have expressed their apprehension about the Bill. An apprehension is there  that the Union may take control over all the dams.  Through this Bill, the  Government is acquiring the power.  The Government wants to give certain things,  even advice from the top.  The States should be empowered so that they will take  care of themselves because these dams have been erected by the States themselves  from their funds.  The Dam Safety Bill, 2019 continues to suffer from a number of  lacunae.  For example, the whole dam safety mechanism is dominated by the  Central Water Commission with Chairperson of CWC being the Chairman of  National Committee on Dam Safety.  The CWC is also involved in policy making  about dams, in their approval, guiding designs, financing, monitoring, approving  seismic parameters, flood forecasting and so on and so forth. Dam Safety is  essentially a regulatory function and thus CWC has clear conflict of interest in  being involved in the dam safety mechanism.  The CWC also has had very poor  track record in dam safety and the Kerala episode is the latest instance. The second  point is that the dam safety mechanism has to essentially work in public interest  and the people at risk are the biggest stakeholders, not only the State Governments.  Unfortunately, the Bill does not even define who are the stakeholders of dam  safety.  The Bill requires appointment of up to three, out of a total of 21 members,  specialists in the field of dam safety and allied fields.  But there is no mention of  these persons having an independent track record, nor is there any mechanism  mentioned as to how they will be selected.  I should also mention that dam safety is  a primary concern of this country. To protect life and property of the people of our  country, there is a need, but it has to be a regulatory mechanism.  That regulatory  mechanism cannot be a top-down approach.  Empower the states, they should do it. The Government itself is  saying that aviation is one of the fastest growing sectors in the country.  I would  like to ask the Government as to why the Government is removing some airports  from the ambit of AERA.  The Government should expand the regulator rather  than making two separate regulators.    Now AAI will work as an operator and  the  regulator as well.  Aviation is a service industry and the past experiences have  shown that the service always goes down in the absence of checks and balances as  the regulator and the operator being the same.  Regulator is meant to be an  independent body but now the Government will become one.  We are not against  privatization.  It is good as long as it is transparent and fair. Firstly, let me pay my homage to the great  martyrs by recounting the tragedy of April 1919.  The Jallianwala Bagh massacre  took place on 13 April , 1919. It was with this tragedy precipitated by the British  that the freedom movement took an irreversible turn.   The Trust referred to in the  Bill is the Trust formed by the Indian National Congress in 1920 in memory of the  great sacrifice made by the freedom fighters of Jallianwala Bagh.  In 1923 the  Trust purchased the land for the project.  That being the fact, if the Government of  the day and the Ruling Party have any issue with the Trust, I ask the Government  to hand over the Trust back to the Indian National Congress to whom it  legitimately belongs.   So, let us not destroy our own history and its people by this  Bill which tries to obliterate the role of Indian National Congress and the symbols  of the freedom movement. I humbly request the hon. Minister not to delete the  \\u2018President of Indian National Congress\\u2019 as Trustee. The Bill aims at reducing the  workload of the overburdened AERA.  The Government must consider the fact that  the aviation sector in India is a booming sector with an annual growth rate of 10-11  per cent.  So, the Government must focus on ensuring that the AERA's capacity is  increased and also ensure that all airports must be regulated by a tariff regulatory  authority set up by the Government.  I would request the Minister to increase the  jurisdiction of AERA.  Only the presence of an independent regulator keeping a  watch on the revenue deriving practices of such operators would help to ensure that  the interest of the common man is protected.  I would like to suggest to the hon.  Minister to include the amount of cargo that is being transported through and  stored in airports as a category in classifying major airports. The Bill aims to provide a robust legal and  institutional framework of State and Central Governments for safety of dams. The  Bill further envisages prevention and mitigation of dam-failure related disasters by  way of proper surveillance, inspection, operation and maintenance of all dams in  the country to ensure their safe functioning.  Some states are opposing this on the  ground that it encroaches upon the sovereignty of States. I urge upon the  Government to show magnanimity and clear this scepticism.  In spite of having  abundant resources and an average rainfall in the country being about 4,000 billion  cubic meters, we are still unplanned.  Regarding Polavaram project, an amount of  Rs. 6727 crore has been released by the Central Government and still the balance  amount of Rs. 4554 crore is yet to be reimbursed by the Central Government to the  State.  This project should be considered to be a national project.  I would like to  remind this House that nearly 1300 dams were constructed in the British era, and  unsafe dams can cause hazard to human life, flora and fauna, public and private  assets and environment. There are about 5300 large dams  in India, out of which around 293 are more than 100 years old and 1041 are 50 to  100 years old.  Dams play a key role in fostering rapid and sustained agricultural  growth and development and they are vital for ensuring water security of the  country.  An unsafe dam can be a hazard to human life, flora and fauna, public and  private assets and the environment.  As many as 14 dams in Telangana State  require urgent repairs.  In September 2017, our Telangana State had sent proposals  to the Central Water Commission seeking Rs. 645 crore for rejuvenation of 29 old  dams. The said proposals were forwarded to the World Bank for funding. But the  funds are still awaited. I also request the Government to accord national status to  water projects in Telangana like Kaleswaram and Palamuru Ranga Reddy.  Additional grants may be sanctioned for irrigation purpose for reservoirs upto 20  tmc of water. States may be empowered with full powers to undertake their  maintenance, protection and everything concerning this subject. Krishna and  Godavari rivers have hundreds of small dams and reservoirs which are the lifeline  of our Telangana State people in their day-to-day life, and they need to be  protected on top priority.  I have gone through this Bill. Opposition Members  say that the Bill is a kind of challenge to the federal structure. Clear and detailed  guidelines have been set up. So, there is no scope of mismanagement and misuse  of this Bill in future.  The Central Water Commission has given clearance for  construction of a multi-purpose project in Dibang Valley with a capacity of 2880  megawatt. In my native area Siang, a project with 1700 megawatt capacity has  been approved. In Subansiri, a 2000-megawatt capacity project in Luhit has also  been sanctioned.  There is an apprehension in the minds of the people of Assam  and Arunachal Pradesh. So, we need to remove this apprehension from the minds  of the people and enlighten them about the usefulness of dams at the river basins of  Arunachal Pradesh.  I would like to see a unified government machinery to  establish good kind of strong mega dams in Arunachal Pradesh so that we can  regulate water flow to Assam and Bangladesh.  I would like to tell Ministry of  Jalshakti that it should not go with only safety but also go downstream. Develop  North-Eastern states so that power can be developed, as per the necessity of the  future, in the North-Eastern States of this country.  I would like to thank you for allowing me  to speak on the discussion taking place on Dam Safety Bill, 2019 in the House.  Certainly, the Centre and the States have equal right on the dams. The Minister has  also made it clear that the Government is not snatching away the right of the States  under it. The Bill will help in reforming the Dam Safety provisions and it will  ensure the safety of the dams under construction. Therefore, taking necessary steps  for ensuring safety of the dams becomes a national responsibility.  This Bill will  prove effective in increasing the irrigated area in those regions where irrigated  areas do not exist and also help in transforming them. A terrible situation has  occurred several times in Rajasthan due to flooding of seasonal rivers during  monsoon season. Therefore, a plan should be formulated for construction of dams  around their course of flow so that the water crisis can be resolved. Besides, I have  a suggestion for the Hon. Minister that a report should be sought regarding the  status of all the dams in Rajasthan. A lot of encroachment has taken place at the  Ramgarh dam of the Ramgarh area and even the Supreme Court has ordered to  remove the encroachment but despite that, the encroachment at the Ramgarh dam  is not getting removed.  Besides, water provision should be made for irrigation of  various areas of Marwad region. Today we are discussing the issue  of privatization of airports.  But one thing must be ensured that whenever we  privatize any airport, the workers working at the airports and in the airlines should  not face any difficulty.  If it is not ensured, many people would become jobless.  I  welcome the UDAN scheme introduced by the Government.  A few days back the  Chief Minister of Maharashtra has inaugurated the Belore Airport at Amravati.   The Maharashtra Government has also said that this airport would be included in  the UDAN scheme.  I would like to urge upon the Central Government to sanction  an amount of Rs. 101 crore for the construction of this airport.  If fund is provided  early for airport, its construction work would start soon. I would like to draw the attention of the  government to a serious problem being faced by my constituency. Behat,  Saharanpur and Deoband tehsils in Saharanpur Lok Sabha Constituency have  many intermittent monsoon rivers flowing there. Every year, flood causes massive  havoc and large scale erosion in this area.  I request the government to get repaired  the broken embankment and dams in these villages. The bridge in Maganpura  village at Badshahi Bagh, Behat tehsil was washed away during the flood of  2012.  The previous government announced to rebuild the dam, but the work has not been  started as yet. The flood turns Hussain Malakpur, Shahpur and Dabkora villages in  Behat Tehsil into island. So I request the government to construct the embankment  and dam there.  It is a very important Bill  given that a number of dams in our country are over 100 years old.  My State  Karnataka has 236 large dams out of which 44 dams are 100 years old or more.   Cracks have been noted in the structure of Krishnaraja Sagar Dam which falls in  my Parliamentary Constituency Mandya.  This is due to  illegal mining activity and  high intensity quarry blasts.  I would like to request the Hon. Minister to include  this dam also in this most important Bill to prevent any potential disasters arising  out of this in my region Mandya. The Dam Safety Bill, 2019 is aimed at  developing uniform safety procedure for all the dams across the country.  In the  locality of the place where I come from, there is Hirakud Dam, which is the longest  major earthen dam of the world.  During the construction of Hirakud Dam, 25,000  families were ousted.  These people have not been rehabilitated and neither they  have been paid compensation.   So, I demand that the relatives of the persons, who  have been displaced, should be paid adequate compensation.  The health of the  dam is very poor and many big holes are there.  The Hirakud Dam is dying a  natural death. So, it needs immediate repairing.  Unless it is repaired, this dam may  collapse at any time. Hirakud supplies water to industries and these industries are  discharging their waste in the river which is causing rising cases of cancer in  Bargarh Tehsil.  I request the hon. Minister to resolve the problems of Hirakud at  the earliest. I would like to raise some issues  related to the dams in Jharkhand.  The Government has acquired 94 Sq. Km. of  land from Jharkhand for Masanjor Dam but only 8,100 hectare of land in  Jharkhand is being irrigated through this dam whereas 2,26,000 hectare of land in  West Bengal is being irrigated through it.  An agreement was signed in 1978 to  build Sidusawari Dam for Jharkhand but that has not been done.  Only 12% of the  land is under irrigation in Jharkhand.  Godda district in Jharkhand was slated to  receive water from the Chanan Project in Bihar but no water has been supplied  here even in the 50 years.   Jharkhand is suffering most in respect of dam projects.    Radu river pond project was started in 1989 but it is still incomplete.  Maithen,  Masanjor, Panchayat Gumani projects are lying pending for the last two decades.  I  would like the Government to do justice with Jharkhand. Our hon. Prime Minister has the foresight that the  most prominent need of our country in future is the need of potable water.  The  Central Government should ensure the proper safety of all such dams which  receive water flow.  There are a number of dams around Alwar district namely  Silised Dam, Jaisamand Dam, Pratap dam, Baleta dam, Vijay Mandir dam.  I have  come to know that there is very large quantity of silt in these dams.  There should  also be provision of extracting out silt deposited in these dams and a proper budget  allocation therefore should be utilized in coordination of State Governments.  A  Commission should be constituted to identify the places at which dams can be built  in future. We have been providing water to each  place from Northern to Western India through a river system emerging from the  Himalayas.  The Bhakra Nangal Dam on the river Satluj has a lot of silt.  Firstly,  we will have to bring out this silt from the dam.  Secondly, the water during rainy  season spilling over from the dams built on the river Ravi, Beas and Satluj reaches  to Pakistan.  I request to construct a dam at Harik Port or somewhere near it so as  to supply water to Rajasthan through Rajasthan canal.  Bhakra Dam Management  Board has the majority of personnel belonging to Punjab who work as its technical  and administrative staff.  These officers use the water as per their requirement due  to which Delhi, Haryana and Rajasthan suffer.  Hence, there should be officers  from Haryana or Rajasthan for its share of water.  The Kishau dam supplies water  to six states and most of the water is to be supplied to Delhi, Rajasthan and  Haryana.  This is highly needed, this issue should be solved as soon as possible.   Sharada- Yamuna, a big project needs to be considered.    It is a very small amendment in the   Section 13 of the  original Act.   Earlier AERA was empowered to regulate  tariff  and other charges for aeronautical services but through this amendment that has  been changed.  Now this will be decided by the tender process.  Section 13 deals   with  various points like efficiency of the airport, quality and the services provided  by the airport, cost of improving efficiency and concession offered by the  Government.  These will not be removed rather these will be ensured on one to one  basis during tender process.   I am sure the Government will keep a check on the  costing also.   The Bill has increased the threshold for annual passenger traffic for  major airports from 15 lakh to 35 lakh.   It is also a positive sign that people have  shown interest in making investment in aviation sector.   The decision to privatize  the airports was taken for the first time during the regime of Shri Atal Bihari ji.   With the privatization of  airports at Delhi  and Mumbai, the profit of Airport  Authority increased manifold.  We have improved our ATC services.  Air traffic  controllers work under tremendous pressure.  I request the Government to do  justice with air traffic controllers.  The Government should also make some  provision for refund of ticket money in case of death of the person.   The  Government has proposed extension of Patna airport.  My submission is that it  would be better if a new airport is established in the eastern side of Patna.    The  Government should also reduce the tariff.    It will facilitate our passengers. As per this Bill the airports  handling 3.5 million passengers per annum will be classified as Major Airports.  I  request the Government to make it  2.5 million passengers per annum so that more  airports could come under the control of AERA.  Earlier AERA was regulating 30  airports but now it has come down from 30 to 13 airports.  The remaining 17  airports will come under the Civil Aviation Ministry and the passengers can expect  respite in charges here. It is unfair and unjust.  I would like to know whether the  Government is going to award full-fledged status of an international airport to  Tirupati Airport.   Now the Ministry of Civil Aviation is empowered to bid out  private airport projects on the basis of pre-determined tariff.  By doing this the  powers of AERA have been cut down and it will become an advisory body only.  I  request the Government to empower this body in all respects be it financial ability  or managerial ability or about taking decisions for improvement in services.  There  is wide variation in airport tariffs which is ultimately recovered from the  passengers.  The Government should look after the Public Sector Airlines for  regulation of tariff.   The Government has sanctioned green field airports in  Bhogapuram, Orvakal and Mangalagiri but no further development has taken place  so far. In my State of Odisha, we have seen a  massive increase in daily passenger count over the last few years, primarily due to  growth of the State under the able leadership of hon. Chief Minister, Shri Naveen  Patnaik.  Bhubaneswar itself is a smart city and Odisha constantly hosts national  and international events.  We understand the benefits this Bill brings in term of  competitive tariffs through privatisation.  The hon. Chief Minister of Odisha, Shri  Naveen Patnaik, has already made a request to the hon. Minister to introduce a  flight between Bhubaneswar and Dubai as currently there is no flight connecting  Odisha with the Middle Eastern countries.  Lastly, keeping in mind the tremendous  potential for growth in this sector of my home State of Odisha, I request the  Government to consider measures for increasing the number of both domestic and  international airports in Odisha as this will be a great boon for my people and for  the nation.   Air travel would become cheaper and  convenient through the provisions made in this Bill.  The threshold limit for the  major airport has been increased from 15 lakh passenger traffic to 35 lakh  passenger traffic, which is a welcome step.  There is an airport at Patna in Bihar.   Patna Airport is among some such airports which have been categorized as  dangerous airports.  It has been categorized as dangerous one due to its short length  of runway.  Alternative should be identified for this airport and the Government  has also made efforts for it. I would like to know from the Hon. Minister by when  domestic flights from Bihta airport would start, for which agreement has been  reached.  Gaya is an international airport.  People come here for tourism and  pilgrimage.  Only one Air India flight AI 433 was operational from this airport,  which has been cancelled for the last two months.  It should be started again.   Cargo service should also be introduced from this airport.   In respect of the Arbitration and  Conciliation (Amendment) Bill, 2019, I would have been happier to see that  Clause (3) is substituted by Section 11 itself and the system of choosing the  arbitrator by the third parties themselves as well as making appointment of a third  party by the High Court or the district court or whatever it may be is abolished by  establishing a permanent Arbitral Tribunal across India and all the arbitrations are  sent to such an institution and every arbitrator may be treated as a public servant  within the meaning of the Indian Penal Code as those appointed u/s 11 (1)(2)(3) of  the Principal Act do not have any accountability. The arbitration proceeding not  being only a Saturday-Sunday job, should be made a regular work followed by  bringing in a provision that an arbitrator should have not more than 5 or 7 or 8  cases of arbitration with imposition of a certain time limit for dealing with such  cases.  Referring to Part 1 (A) regarding Arbitration Council of India, the term  \\u2018function under the Act\\u2019 should be substituted by \\u2018function under the chapter\\u2019 to  avoid the confusion prevailing therein. Section 11 is required to be removed totally  and made it like Section 11 (3). Children are viewed as manifestation of  divinity.  Any harm to the children is harm to divinity and humanity.  The  proposed amendments show the gloomy and insecure situation of children,  particularly girl child in the country.  No legislation can foresee how the future  unfolds. If law is unable to meet the needs of changing situation, it must be re- examined.  \\u2018Nirbhaya\\u2019 happened in December, 2012.  Can law give such a long  rope to convicts of heinous crimes even after the Apex Court confirms the death  sentence.  In the \\u2018Saravana Case\\u2019, it took 18 years for the convicts to surrender.  In  our judicial delivery system, there is a long gap between crime and punishment.   This Bill seeks to increase the quantum of punishment by including death penalty.   My apprehension is that it may actually lead to the death of the victim in order to  destroy the evidence by the culprits.  Self-Help Groups and NGOs can also play an  instrumental role in conducting mass awareness programmes.  I would suggest that  there is a need to conduct campaign like \\u2018Child Sexual Assault Awareness Month\\u2019  to educate people and prevent sexual violence.  The compensation must include  rehabilitation of victim. This Amendment Bill is very  powerful but how much did we achieve in the last seven years after the Act came  into force? Crime of this nature has gone up.  The Government should strengthen  the areas which pull back reporting, investigation and punishment.  We should  provide a clear path way, compensation, guidance, or help to the victim till he or  she becomes self-sufficient.  In the case of rehabilitation of POCSO victims, the  skill development programmes designed for the children above 18 years could be  relaxed suitably.  A high value compensation should be fixed.  There is a need for  engagement of Counselors in our schools.  The amendments must include stringent  punishment for offenders in case the victim is a child with special needs or a  differently-abled child. Sexual violence against children  in any form is a heinous crime. The conviction rate in such cases has declined in  the last 10 years, while the pendency has climbed up.  While sexual offences  against children must be stringently prosecuted, the solutions also lie in preventive  efforts and in strengthening implementation of the existing laws and schemes.  The  process is lengthy which delays justice to the victims.  A hassle-free process is  required.  SHE Teams Division, which stands for Safety, Health and Environment  has been very much successful in Telangana.  Such initiatives may be taken into  consideration before finalizing the Bill. Steps should be taken for time bound  investigations, trial and disposal of appeals, restrictions on bail, new fast-track  courts, special forensic labs etc. with stringent implementation of laws to prevent  sexual offences to combat this menace on top priority. The most important aspect  of this Bill is setting up of Arbitration  Council of India.  The recommendations to  this effect had come from Justice Srikrishna Committee. This Committee  recommended that the Chairperson of the ACI should be a judge of the Supreme  Court or the Chief Justice of a High Court .  But we see that the Government of  India is  making the appointment. Why the Government of India has  to be  included in that clause which says that they have to appoint the Chairperson in  consultation with the Chief Justice of India. The term 'inclusion of an eminent  person itself is a little vague.  There has to be some boundary, some  limitation  on  the qualification of people from among whom  that eminent person can be picked  up. What  is the theory behind the inclusion  of an eminent academician having   experience in research and teaching?' Completion of pleadings within six months is  also proposed in this Bill.  It is definitely  a shorter period.  The Government may  please definitely look at this. Once the award is given, it should be made binding  on all parties.  Clause 9 of the Bill has a very important provision.  Definitely,   there is  the intention of going global in terms of arbitration and creating a nice  arbitration hub in India also. Reassuring  to support this Bill, I hope the Hon'ble  Minister would be kind enough to throw some clarity on the suggestions that we  have proposed. I would like to point out that all the  political parties and the entire House are unanimously supporting this Bill.  The  provision of the kind punishments made in this Bill would certainly be helpful in  removing the perversion and sexual offences against children in our society.   Moreover, I would like to request the hon. Minister to make provision for creating  awareness in the society at the Gram Panchayat level and at the family level as  well.   In view of the number of arbitration and  reconciliation cases in businesses, the Government must bring detailed guidelines  aided by legislation to ensure impartial and unbiased arbitration in the country.   Definitive provisioning of ethical clarity and probity are mandatory.  Clause 43(C)  of the Bill is vague and unclear.  I suggest that a separate clause be added to define  in detail the qualifications and pre-requisites and eligibility criteria for the eminent  member.  Similarly, ambiguity in clause 43C (f) will give way to unethical and  influenced inclusions thereby affecting the purpose of the process.  I suggest that a  detailed criterion be added as an amendment to ensure ethical probity.  Sir, I would  like to urge upon the Government that ethical probity must be the cardinal content  and principle of arbitration and the Bill must not be vague or unclear about this as  international arbitration is an area where even a single omission of honesty will be  damaging the integrity of the country and its standing. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act,  1996 has been brought up for discussion. This will be the right step towards  promoting institutional arbitration to settle any business dispute. With the  enactment of this law, the arbitration process will pave the way for easy, affordable  and speedy disposal. Also, intervention of courts will be less and impartiality will  also be ensured. There is a law of arbitration now, but due to not being fully  effective, the parties are not ready to accept it and are compelled to go for  protracted litigation. In international affairs, there is more trust in arbitration  abroad rather than arbitration in our country. Now this legislation will help in  planning to make India the best hub of institutional arbitration at domestic and  international levels. Foreign institutions, who used to go to the International  Arbitrator of London, Paris, Geneva, Singapore, New York for arbitration, will  now move to India. Niti Aayog also has made an important contribution to this. I  would like to suggest that under this law, except in the cases involving  constitutionality or otherwise, the intervention and interference of civil courts  should be completely abolished. Secondly, the arbitrator has the right to execution  of the award and execution proceedings, and all the relevant government agencies  are bound to abide by it, only then the law will be fully competent. Different types of contracts are  signed with the Government or private parties where there is a mention of courts,  etc. Would these contracts too come under the Arbitration Act? My request is that  we should think of district courts also. If the panel of the arbitrators agrees  completely and it has given the arbitration award, then it should not be allowed in  the court. Various States of the country are  wrangling over water disputes warranting immediate resolution.  It was way back  in the year 1956 that Inter-State River Water Dispute Act had been enacted.  Under  the Act there would be separate Tribunals for the resolution of Inter-State Water  Disputes.  In the first place, the Central Government used to make an attempt to  find a resolution of the disputes and subsequently in the event of the dispute not  being resolved, it would be referred to the Tribunal.  The irrigation potential of  every State is distinctly different from the other one.  So, it must also form the  basis for sharing of water.  Even in this day and age, in a few districts of  Marathwara region in Maharashtra water is made available by Rail.  It is essential  that in the event of disputes between the States over water the matter should be  referred to Dispute Resolution Committee or a Tribunal in order that the States  concerned may get their due share of water and there is equal distribution of water  across the country.  I would like to suggest that no member of the State concerned  should be taken on board in the Dispute Resolution Committee.  If at all there  arises a need for additional members on the committee, there should be a provision  to  increase the number of members in consultation with the Chief Justice of India. When for the first time  the Tribunal came  into existence in the year 1956, this did resolve water disputes to some extent.   However, the problem is far from being over.  Be it the State of Odisha or be it  Jharkhand, water disputes have not yet been settled.  As per Rihand and Bansagar  dam agreement Sone basin of Bihar was supposed to receive 5 lakh cusec to 12  lakh cusec water between December and April but even 1000 cusec water is not  supplied to the Bihar based Sone river, let alone its due share.  I demand that Sone  river basin must be given the quantum of water as per the Agreement.  Further, a  proposal for the construction of a dam over Sone barrage has been sent to the  Union Government by the Government of Bihar.  This proposal should be acted on  at the earliest possible.  Finally, I would like to suggest that the Bill should have  penal provisions for the State Governments not adhering to the judgement of the  Tribunal. Some people are selling 15 to 20  years old properties with the help of fake documents. Some cases of sale of  government properties by creation of fake documents have also come to light.  Hence legislation was required in this regard. I would like to request one thing that  some extra rooms and offices built in certain premises should not be demolished  because new occupant would be making extra investment. So this provision needs  a relook. I support this Bill. This Bill was very much needed.  So many  tribunals have been established to solve the river water dispute between different  States but there is no solution of these disputes till date.  Rajasthan did not get its  due share of water despite several agreements.  Punjab always deny that they don't  have enough water to share with Rajasthan.  Choudhary Kumbharam lift canal  project has come into existence and this project was to irrigate 2.40 lakh hectares  of land.  Farmers are waiting for water to irrigate their land till date.  Even today  flood irrigation is rampant in the entire State.  The Government should take  initiative in this regard.  If flood irrigation is checked, we can save 50 per cent of  water. I rise to support this Bill wholeheartedly as I  come from the State of Haryana that has had to suffer from the inadequacies of the  Inter-State River Water Disputes Act, 1956.  The first allocation of surplus Ravi- Beas River waters was made in the year 1976.  Thereafter, Haryana mooted the  construction of SYL canal to carry the waters allocated to it.  However, there was  no progress from Punjab side.  Ultimately, an agreement was signed among  Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. The construction of SYL Canal was inaugurated  on 11th April, 1982.  Thereafter, the situation became tense which ultimately led to  the Punjab settlement, popularly known as Rajiv Longowal Accord.  It was this  Accord which provided for the water allocation by a Tribunal.  The Tribunal  submitted its Report in 1987.  As some clarifications were sought under Section  5(3) of the Act of 1956, even after 36 years, it has not come to any conclusion.  So,  I want to say that it is not just a techno-legal but it is essentially a political issue.  I  hope this Bill will go a long way in addressing the issues as it provides for a new  Tribunal to be formed and for the dissolution of the previous Tribunal dealing with  Ravi-Beas waters. Vidharbha is one the most backward  areas of this country.  Availability of water in this area is inadequate for setting up  industries.  If water is made available in this area through water-lifting technology  then this area is likely to attract big industries which will ultimately help in  mitigating the unemployment problem also. So, I would urge upon the Government  to link the Wein Ganga Project to Pan Ganga so that the farmers of whole  Vidharbha and Marathwara regions may be benefitted and potable water may also  be made available to the people of this area.  So, I support this Bill.     I support this very important  Bill as this Bill has been brought to simplify and streamline the justice delivery  system in inter-state river water disputes.  Under the provisions of this Bill, various  tribunals have been subsumed into a single permanent tribunal.  The Eastern  Rajasthan Canal Project is a very important project and it is also the lifeline of the  farmers.  Under this project, water for drinking and irrigation purposes are  proposed to be provided in the 13 districts of Rajasthan. So, I would like to urge  upon the Government that this project should be included in the national projects  and work pertaining to this project should be completed at the earliest so that the  people of Rajasthan may get drinking water.  In addition to that, Ishabda Dam is  related with my district which is proposed to be completed into two phases.  I  would request the Government to complete it at the earliest.  Under this project,  landlords-farmers should be provided compensation as per the provisions of the  new Land Acquisition Bill so that their displacement process may be completed.    Apart from that, a dam project on Dubbi Banas river in Sawai Madhopur should be  approved so that water for drinking and irrigation purposes may be made available  in our area. This Bill is for the common  welfare. While filing election nomination one must give an affidavit that till the  time he/she holds the office, he/she will enjoy the Government facilities and the  day he/she relinquishes the office, he/she will vacant the official accommodation.  First of all we should act as a moral citizen. Thousands of people are in the waiting  list. Still there is ten years waiting time. This Bill is not only for accommodation  but it is for every piece of land which is in Delhi. There are more than 500 piece of  land in Delhi which have been illegally occupied. I urge the hon'ble Minister to  form a special investigation team in this regard. There are  almost 3,500 houses out of 15,000 houses to get vacated.  There is a clause in the  Bill which says that if some temporary structure is made on some premises, it has  to be demolished at the cost of whoever has stayed there.  I have another  suggestion to make. Let there be a special Committee to review the genuineness on  case-to-case basis.  But whoever goes to court in order to get more time should be  imposed a penalty of double the market rent. Then only the new MPs would get  houses. The fact that there are 3,081 such cases shows  that the law simply is not strong enough and it does not have enough teeth.  I  would urge the hon. Minister to seriously consider that there should be, as in many  other cases and in many other Acts, a bar of civil court jurisdiction in cases relating  to Public Premises Act.  I agree that you left the charges and the damages as  indeterminate, which is wrong. According to me, you should determinate the  charges.  I believe that there are one or two things that the hon. Minister left in the  realm of a little bit of subjectivity. For instance, you said, in section 3B that the  estate officer must forthwith issue notice in writing. Now, for an estate officer,  \\u2018forthwith\\u2019 could mean anything.  \\u2018Forthwith\\u2019 must be replaced with \\u2018within 12  hours or 24 hours\\u2019.  The person must be immediately put on notice. Please bring in  as draconian a law as possible because people who are in public service must set an  example, and if they do not set an example, then they must pay dearly for not  setting that example. If the law was present, then it should have  been brought much before. There are 15000 houses for  government employees  and out of these 3000 houses are under eviction process. A government servant,  when he is about to retire manoeuvres, to grab a constitutional post, so that he  could be entitle to retain his accommodation after getting the post. The government  should make a provision for providing a rental accommodation in open market for  the persons seeking extension of their services after attaining 60 years of age.  I  think that the government will definitely think about the practice of retaining  designated houses or accommodations on the pretext of government service. There  should be only two categories of accommodations for the Members of Parliament  and allot from whatever category you want. Let the government construct the  Type-7, Type-8, Type-9 or Type-10 houses for the officers or the Ministers. The  categorization of accommodations in government of India must be stopped.  The Bill had made sure that the  national level and the State level commissioners will be nominated or appointed by  the Central Government without specifying the qualifications for these  Commissioners.  I would like to say that rather than bothering about the revenue  that the Government can generate, it should bother about the civilians or  consumers.  We are talking about consumer protection but how can we expect a  common and illiterate person to get justice when he is cheated.  Sometimes the  products are sold above the MRP.  In this regard, there should be some kind of e- mail system and the complainant should be given a detailed reply about what  action has been taken.  Frivolous cases are being filed against medical  professionals.  I would suggest the Government to come up with a policy where  any complaint would be sent to the State Medical Commission and the case should  be filed only after obtaining the approval from the Commission. This Bill is an important step  towards safeguarding and promoting and enforcing the interests of the consumers.   Now a days, a number of people place orders  online.  In case, they get substandard  or faulty goods, the suppliers do not pay heed to their complaints on one or another  pretext.  This lead to a loss to the customers, ultimately.  We should have provision  in the Bill to fix the accountability on the suppliers in such situations.  Besides, the  Government should have mentioned the number of Commissioners which will  constitute the CCPA.  Further, the Government should ensure provision in the Bill  for judicial representation in the Redressal Commissions.  The Government should  form an independent selection committee with the representation of the judiciary  for the purpose of appointment of the Members of the Redressal Commissions.   The State Government should be given rights to appoint members in the Redressal  Commission in their respective States.  The Government should also set up a  regulatory framework to ensure the timely redressal of the cases in which the  consumers have been cheated by the multinational companies. The Consumer Protection Act was passed in  the year 1986 but a number of posts of president and members are still lying vacant  in several consumer forums. There are circuit benches of State Commissions in  several States but in the state of Uttar Pradesh, there is only a single State  Consumers Commission.  At least 5 circuit benches of State Commission should be  established in Uttar Pradesh also.   Eligibility of candidates to be appointed as  members of State Commission and District Forums should be at least law graduate  and prescribed reservation should also be ensured for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled  Tribes and the most backward classes. The sanctioned strength of employees  should be enhanced indifferent consumer forums so that cases can be decided  timely. The Code is going to merge four Labour Laws  as everyone has already mentioned to make it a single Code.  It mandates that  wages have to be revised once in every five years.  So, it is a welcome move.  I just  want to make one observation.  When MGNREGA was first introduced, it affected  the labour supply in the country for all the industries.  This has forced the  employers to re-look at their minimum wages and actually offer more lucrative  wages to attract that labour force back to industry.  So, my suggestion to the  Minister of Labour is to please interact and work with the Minister of Rural  Development also to ensure that the MGNREGA rate and the minimum wage are  synchronized in such a manner that benefits both the sectors.  I would request that  House Rent Allowance be included under wage.  The Code is also silent about the  discrimination in recruitment and I feel that it is a glaring gender discrimination  towards women.  Sub-Clause (3) to Clause 9, it says that the Central Government  consults the States in fixing the minimum wages. I suggest for considering of the  hon. Minister to substitute the word \\u201econsultation\\u201f with \\u201econcurrence\\u201f.  It is only  then you get justified wages for the workers. Given the pendency of cases in the  Consumer Forum there is really a need to have a new and a more dynamic law  which is in tune with the changing times and needs.  This becomes all the more  relevant in view of the growing popularity of online purchase.  The Government  has brought a new comprehensive Bill with the intention of protecting consumer  rights and the unfair and restricted trade practices have been well defined.  Though,  the Bill does not specify minimum judicial qualification for the person to be  appointed as President and members of Consumer Disputes Redressal  Commission.  Consumer Protection Councils are supposed to play an advisory  role.  What I fail to understand is who exactly the Consumer Protection Council is  rendering advice to.  I want the hon. Minister to clarify this.  The recommendations  of the Standing Committee have not been incorporated in this Bill.  I support this  Bill. The Old Consumer Protection  Act, 1986 is now being replaced by this new Bill. This Bill aims to protect the  consumers affected by e-commerce.  This new Bill will pave the way for a  Bureaucratic body to be run by bureaucrats and politicians and hence will totally  lose the identity and recognition of a quasi-judicial body.  This Bill should have  new provisions aimed at protecting the rights of the consumers, without taking  away the rights of the State Governments, and providing judicial powers to the  Consumer Protection Councils or Courts.  Besides, this Bill should have the  powers to appoint District Judges, High Court judges and the Supreme Court  Judges in the Consumer Protection Councils. The Second National Commission on  Labour in its report in 2002 recommended that the existing state of labour laws  should be broadly amalgamated among groups such as industrial relations, wages,  social security, safety, and welfare and working conditions.  With the consideration  and passing of Code on Wages Bill, 2019, it would become much easier to simply  refer to four labour codes as against existing 44 labour laws.  The provision  relating to timely payment of wages and authorized deduction from wages shall be  made applicable to employees irrespective of wage ceiling.  The provision of  Inspector-cum-Facilitator would end Inspector raj.  Equal remuneration to the  employees irrespective of the gender for the same work is a good reform.  I would  like to suggest an addition that the minimum wage structure proposed by the  National Minimum Wage Commission should be taken into consideration.  The  Central and State Governments will constitute their respective advisory boards  which will advise the respective State Governments on aspects including, fixation  of minimum wages; increasing employment opportunities for women, and any  other matter relating to this Code.  Regarding claims under the Code, application  may be filled within a period of three years.  The Bill prescribes one registration  for one establishment. The provision of \\u201eone licence, one return\\u201f in place of  multiple licences and returns in existing 13 labour laws is subsumed in the Code.   Through these provisions, we have initiated a step towards the welfare of workers\\u201f  lives. This amendment will boost the morale of the workers and ultimately the  productivity of industries and organizations. I would like the government to lay down such  provision that any Inspector or officer of the department may keep protecting  interests of the workers in unorganized sector. The issue of minimum wages is  discussed in the House or implemented in the organized sector but not in  unorganized sector. I want that such a system should be in place that the workers  working even at village level are identified and their interests are protected. The  working hours and minimum wages for the workers in unorganized sector should  be fixed clearly and overtime allowance should be provided for anyone working  beyond the specified working hours. The government should protect their interests. This Bill has been presented as a  consolidated Bill by including four Bills. Nothing has been said in this Bill  regarding the manner of resolving the problems arising out of this consolidated  Bill. There is much difference between the contract given to the contractor and the  payment made to the labourers by the contractor. This gap should not be so big. If  there are a lot of differences in minimum wages in different states, it would also  create more problems. So far as payment of bonus is concerned, if the profit is  higher, the bonus should also be higher. Consultation with the states is very  necessary so that the employees do not have to face much problems. The Government has introduced this  Bill keeping in view the interests of labourers.  However, I would like to mention  that the contribution  of women labourers should also be  considered  while  discussing labourers' issue. These  women contribute to maximum in every  sector,  be it construction, agriculture, cattle rearing or any other unorganized sector.   However, these women face exploitation in the hands of contractors.  I would also  like to mention that 80% of the labourers working in brick kilns are women.  I  request the Government to make such a provision in this Bill so that these women  may not get exploited by the contractors.  The Government formulates various  welfare schemes for the labourers but it  should take strong steps to provide benefit  of these schemes on grass root level.       *SHRI M. SELVARAJ: This Government is trying to block the interest and  rights of the labourers of the country through this Bill.  I think that it is aimed to  attract foreign investments in India.   The basic intention is to support the corporate  giants and businessmen.  Before bringing a Bill on wages, the trade unions should                                                              * Original in Tamil.  have been consulted and their suggestions should have been included.  Wages  differ from the State to State which should be made uniform.  The women  labourers face extreme hardships and face difficulties.  We should work in unison  to mitigate their sorrows and sufferings.  The wage should be revised once in two  years.  The job security aspect should be included in this Bill.  Otherwise the lives  of the labourers will not be protected.  Rs. 25,000/- should be fixed as minimum  wage per month.  If the labourers or workers end up in accidents at work places, an  assistance of Rs. 5 lakh should be provided.  If a labourer dies due to an accident at  work place, this Bill should ensure at least Rs. 10 lakh as compensation to his  family members. I have four objections on the introduction of  this Bill.  The first one is that water has been listed as the State subject and hence  Parliament has no competence to make this law.  There is no mandate to offer  compensation to people who are victims of dam failure and the environmental  impact has also not been taken into account in the Bill.  The Government cannot  have under our Constitution, according to the Supreme Court, a CWC functioning  both as an advisor and as the regulator.  There has to be a separate body.  My  fourth objection is about the stakeholder which has not been defined in the Bill.  If  there is a dam failure as we have been fearing in Mullaperiyar in Kerala, our  ordinary citizens will suffer.  So, this Bill should be withdrawn and brought to a  Parliamentary Committee. I stand here to oppose the  introduction of the Dam Safety Bill.  I had opposed it in 2018 also.  But the  concern here is about the legislative competence on which we are agitating about.   This Bill deletes a number of suggestions which were there in 2010 which was  introduced during UPA regime.  Everybody will agree that we need a dam safety  regulation but who has to do it.  It is not Central Water Commission who was  entrusted to prepare a Bill and through this Bill, the Union Government is  appropriating the powers of the States.  Therefore, I insist that let the hon. Minister  go back, reconsider the Bill and talk to respective Governments and come back to  us. I also harbour the same  contentions.  The Government should think whether it will be appropriate to  maintain the dam which is situated in Arunachal Pradesh from Delhi.  It is our  demand that the Bill should be brought here after holding comprehensive  discussion afresh on the matter concerned.  This Bill undermines the federal  structure.  The 2010 UPA version of the Bill was introduced under Article 252 and  all the States were taken on board.  We all want dam safety but that should be  ensured in sync with the law.  The Bill is too focused on the structural safety of  dam and does not address the issue of operational safety in a sufficient manner.   This is a critical lacuna.  Hence, this Bill should be referred to the Parliamentary  Standing Committee. My first objection pertains to Search  Committee which should be strengthened enabling the inclusion of distinguished,  honest and scrupulous people.  This must not be limited to those belonging to  medical profession rather, the specialists from divergent field should be taken on  board.  In case there is dominance of people hailing from solitary group, this will  make an elbow room for the prevalence of  vested interest.  Medical Council of  India was an autonomous body whereas  National Medical Commission has not  been accorded autonomous status.  Fixation of fee for 50 per cent seats is  appreciable, however, I would like to demand that 50 per cent seats in the notified  village areas should be reserved for the students of villages.  In regard to National  Exit Test all I have to say is this test is not at all required after pursuing education  for a period of five years. I would like to speak on two or three  points on this Bill. First, the Government has not given any power to the State  Governments while constituting the Governing Board.  Second, the Indian doctors  have been doing very good job in other countries like UK and USA.  We need to  ensure that some kind of consultation is held with such eminent doctors.  I request  the hon. Minister to carry out some corrections in the Section 10(1), 14(1), 15(1),  15(5) and 32(1) of this Bill.  I also request the hon. Minister to set up two medical  colleges in Bhadradi Kothgudam and Khammam districts of my Parliamentary  Constituency. The students get admission in private medical  colleges too on the basis of NEET score only.  Three projects were placed from  West Bengal under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana which have not  been approved yet.  I would like to suggest that not only the college fees but also  the hostel fee should be capped.  Besides, there is a need to fix the tenure of the  Members of the National Medical Commission.  This will create a good and  transparent scenario.  This Bill will lead to improve the health care system for 130  crore people. I appreciate the  Bill. It would be better if we also really think of increasing the number of Post  graduation seats with some more support services. When we have so much  shortage of senior lecturers or eminent doctors, why can we not consider allowing  these eminent doctors to give at least two lectures weekly so that the quality of  students can also be improve? Some of our friends have said that the Government  is depriving the meritorious candidates by giving 50 per cent seats for quota.  Kindly increase the number of seats to that extent that such anomalies can be  removed. The Companies Act, 2013, which superseded the  Companies Act, 1956 has turned out to be one of most disastrous pieces of  legislation in this country.  My only grievance to this Government is that this  Amendment Bill also does not go far enough.  Otherwise, everything that they do  do amend this Bill is unexceptionable.  I would like to suggest some of the very  urgent improvements that this Act requires, which will facilitate ease of doing  business.  Section 185 and Section 186 have many restrictive conditions whereby  promoters are not able to bring their own funds into their own organizations. The  Government should cap all the penal provisions in regard to non-filing of forms.   Further, the time has come to impose 25 per cent corporate tax across the board.   The discretionary powers of the Regional Directors and the ROCs to impose  penalties should be removed.  The Act does not differentiate between large and  MSME companies. I would like the hon. Minister to explain  Clause 2 of the Bill by which the companies have been asked to submit  applications to the Central Government to determine any period as their financial  year.  I am not in favour of the proposal to change the financial year as this may  not be the right time for that.  The Bill has put restrictions on every company  having share capital not to commence its business or to get borrowings unless the  Directors file declaration within 180 days.  I request the Government to please  consider increasing this period to one year.  I would request the hon. Minister to  please iron out anomalies between SEBI regulations for governing the listed  companies on the one hand and the provisions of the Companies Act on the other.   The Government should look into the contradiction between the Companies Act  and the Listing Agreement for payment of remuneration to the managing director  and the related party transactions.  In the  Indian perspective, these provisions may  create some hurdles because majority of the business in India are family owned. Voting is the foundation for any democracy and it  should be an essential part of democracy if we want to strengthen the democracy.   Similrly, larger voter turnout would is also necessary for strengthening the  democracy in our country.  In our country, poor voter turnout has been recorded  during the elections.  As far as my Parliamentary Constituency is concerned, 75 per  cent voter turnout was recorded during recent elections.  More than 33 countries  across the world have provided for compulsory voting.  I wish that there should be  provision for compulsory voting in our country also.  If a person do not exercise,  his vote then he may be deprived of his voting rights or may be penalized for the  same.  Voting should be made compulsory and the term of reservation should be  doubled in order that in case of a candidate winning from the reserved constituency  he stays assured of his contesting election from the same constituency next time  and remains motivated to work properly.  If somebody desists from voting, he  should be penalised or be made to pay fine so that he may remain conscious in the  next election.  Compulsory voting would strengthen democracy and the  Government would be formed with the participation of everyone.  I support this  Bill. The conduct of the Members of  Parliament must not be such as to make the common man disillusioned with the  polling.  Besides, the elected representatives must be wary of social audit.  On  attaining the age of 18 years there should be a ritual like other Samskars for the  individual as he or she becomes eligible  enough to cast vote.   In the recent past, it  has been witnessed that nearly 2 to 3 per cent of voters are subjected to deletion  from the voter list for some reason or the other.  I would suggest that there should  be one electoral roll for all the elections right from Gram Panchayat to Parliament. In Shayara Bano versus the Union of India  case the Supreme Court set aside the practice of Talaq-e-Biddat.  Talaq-e-Biddat or  instantaneous talaq being followed by some misogynistic Muslim men is not in  consonance with the Quran.  Many Islamic countries have either banned triple  talaq or regulated it.  According to the Bill, if a husband leaves his wife  pronouncing triple talaq, he is punished with imprisonment for a term which may  be extended to three years and a fine.  I would like to ask the Government what if a  Muslim man does not say triple talaq and abandons his wife?  This aspect must  seize the attention of the Government.  Rules and laws should apply equally to  everyone in this country irrespective of caste or religion one belongs to.  The  Government has made triple talaq a cognizable and non-bailable offence, subject to  scrutiny by Magistrate.  On the one hand, the husband is expected to provide  financial assistance to wife and children and, on the other hand, he is being  forwarded to jail.  This Bill seems to be discriminatory.  Therefore, I oppose this  Bill and urge the Government to withdraw it. My party wholeheartedly supports the  Government in matters of national security.  I feel better coordination with the  States and an all-inclusive structure is needed at the national level through  cooperation of multi agencies and joint task forces.  Many more offences such as  espionage, money laundering, drug trafficking, hijacking, assassination, bio  terrorism, narco-terrorism etc also needs to be included within the ambit of  scheduled offences.  Prevention is more important than execution and prosecution.   The NIA is not clear as to what preventive powers it has got.  Prevention is always  best served by acquisition of information.  So, prosecuting agencies must work in  close coordination with the other allied agencies like IB, FIU, DRI etc. to ensure  that they are equipped to prevent rather than merely prosecute.  Given the high rate  of acquittal, the firming up of the entire judicial system is essentially required.  The  180 days' time period given to the police under the NIA to file a chargesheet  should be brought down to 90 days.       The chit fund companies are engaged in  depositing the money of the poor, labourers, shopkeepers etc. by luring them with  higher rate of interest in the whole country. These companies after some time fly  away with the money of such poor people. An stringent law should therefore be  enacted to control such companies and the chit fund companies should be banned  in the entire country. The Sardha Chit Fund Company and the Sahara India  Company have looted the poor people in the country. I would request the hon.  Minister to make a provision in this Bill to ensure that the shopkeepers and the  labourers get small amount loans from the banks easily so that they are  not trapped  by such companies and money lenders. I stand here today in support  of the Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Bill, 2019.  There are a few  questions that I would like to ask the hon. Finance Minister and the MoS, who has  initiated and clarified most of the points that are required.  There are several  schemes pan-India, which are suffering and people are suffering. So, I appreciate  the initiative that this Government has taken. When will the depositors get the  money?  I think that we all have to walk that extra mile to make sure that the final  destination is not just punishment, but the final destination is to make sure that the  person who has lost money in good faith gets it back.  I would request you to  kindly clarify this issue.  Secondly, with regard to benami properties, a lot of  people have talked about it.  You got the law and we all passed it unanimously; but  how are you going to reach and get these properties as there are so many people  who take their money out of the country? So, we need to make sure that money is  repatriated and given to the person who deserves it.  Ponzi schemes obviously have  arms and roots which are so deep that they go where normal banks do not reach.  So, what is the mechanism with which we are going to find out these Ponzi  schemes?  What is the mechanism to spread literacy amongst people and bring in  more awareness?  I would request the Minister to sensitize, walk the extra mile so  that the depositor gets the money especially those who lost their money in Rs.  3,000 crore case of Samruddi in Maharashtra. Non-banking finance sector is very  large, diverse and complex. Repeated attempts have been made to bring in  legislation to curtail and discourage this type of deposit making which is illegal.   There are several regulators.  Non-banking financial companies are under the  regulatory and supervisory jurisdiction of the Reserve Bank of India.  Chit funds  and money circulation schemes are under the domain of the State Governments.   Housing finance companies are under the purview of SEBI and deposit-taking  activities by companies other than NBFCs are regulated by the Ministry of  Corporate Affairs.  Section 45(s) of the RBI Act prohibits acceptance of deposit by  individuals and unincorporated entities.  A time-bound process for settlement of  dues of depositors affected by unregulated deposit schemes should be there. There  should be a regulatory mechanism for the Central and the State Governments to  work against illegal deposit taking activities.   The way chit fund companies are  doing fraud with common man, there is a great need to curb it. In India, at least 6  crore people have been affected from this scheme. At least the deposits, which  have been recovered so far, should be given in the accounts of the people. There  should be proper coordination between Centre and states after enforcement of this  Act. States and the Center should have a coordinating committee and this Act  should be implemented effectively. Depositing is banned at  several places. Small shopkeepers, small traders, small partnership firms which  take loans for their businesses, do not take deposits. They have to do business, set  up small industries, and they take loan for these purposes, there should be  clarification in it in this regard.  Those who are taking loans for their industry or  their shops or their businesses, will be out of its purview.  Investors are not getting  back their money for four, five or seven years. PCL is a big company and it has  deposited the money of a large number of depositors but investors are not getting  back their money. In this regard a law should be enacted so that if the money of  depositors or investors get stuck they may get their money back at the earliest.   There are many small societies in which money of the people has got stuck.  A law  should be enacted to get such money back. All are directly and indirectly related to  this subject. Deposits and withdrawal by people, deposits in banks by bogus  companies and fraud with people, these are the problems that have come to the  fore. Thousands of account holders' money is stuck. I request you to take action on  this, seize their properties and help the people of Maharashtra and these account  holders. I support the amendment made in the Multi-State  Co-operative Societies Act 2002. The amendment made in the Act is that in place  of nominal voters, only permanent voters will be able to deposit money in it and  they will be given interest. I request that our nominal voters should also be retained  in this. The way SARFAESI Act allows banks to recover loans, in the same way  these rules should be applied on these small cooperative societies as well.   Our TRS party support the  Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, 2019.  Every year about 1.5 lakh people die  and about 5 lakh people get injured in road accidents in the country.  So cashless  treatment may be provided to the accident victims.  There are different taxes in  different States.  The Government should think over to modify the tax in smaller  and major States.  Duty hours of drivers should be fixed in order to reduce road  accidents.  Duplicate spare parts are being used in many States and this causes  damage to the vehicles.  Non-availability of parking facility in many places is also  a major problem. Transport sector has been facing a lot of  problems since independence.  Fuel prices are changing on a daily basis.  I think, if  that issue is addressed, the transport sector will benefit.  Similarly, there is heavy  taxation on motor vehicles.  I would like to bring to the notice of the Government  that once the Government of India gets back investment on a particular road, I  think, toll can be removed on that particular road.  This will give a little relief to  the overburdened transport industry.  I would also like to give one suggestion.  To  encourage electric vehicle industry and electric vehicle movement in the country, I  think, giving small incentives, like no toll, will go a long way.  Also, there is lack  of infrastructure on the state highways.  I would request the Government to  impress upon the Minister of Finance and reduce the income tax on the transporters  for the betterment of the industry.  The Bill proposes a heavy penalty in case of  violations.  But this opens up opportunities for more corruption.  Hence, I request  the Government to assure the House that all measures to tackle corruption will be  taken.  I would also request the Government to establish one Government training  institute in each and every district of this country.  The last and the most important  point is related to my Constituency, Vijayawada.  I request the Government to  instruct the officials to start the work pertaining to bypass in the city of  Vijayawada immediately and instruct them to complete it as early as possible. It is for the first time that a provision has  been made for imposing penalties on the road contractors in the cases of accidents  caused due to the shortcomings in the construction and upkeeping of the roads.  It  is a very good step.  It is also for the first time that the failure of giving way to the                                              * Original in Tamil.  emergency vehicles like Ambulance has been made a punishable offence with the  penalty of Rs.10000 in this Bill.  I would like to urge the Government to formulate  a law for population control also.  The provision for increasing the amount of  compensation in the cases of road accidents along with determining a time-frame  of 6 months for the disposal of the claims of compensation is a welcome move.  I  would also like to submit that a large chunk of fertile land has gone in the roads  from Jodhpur and Barmer to Punjab along the border areas under the Bharatmala  Project and hence the compensation should be provided for the same.  I would also  like to know the time by which a green corridor which is under construction  between Amritsar and Bhavnagar is likely to be made operational. Hon. Minister has permitted the transporters in the  entire country to transport additional four tones of load than earlier.  However, this  permission has not been made available to the transporters of Bengal as a result of  which they are facing losses in comparison to the transporters of other States.  I  would, therefore, request the Government to ensure that the transporters of Bengal  also get this permission.  The other problem relates to Toto rickshaw.  Toto is a  good means of transport and also a good source of earning for  the youth and the  poor people.  Toto transports people at low cost.  Commercial tax has been  imposed on Toto in Bardhman district but no such tax has been imposed on similar  vehicles in the entire country.  Hon. Minister should pay attention to this issue so  that it is resolved.    Hon. Minister has brought in a good Bill  in the House.  People should have fear of law.  I would like to submit to the hon.  Minister that he had brought a proposal but later on withdrew it, but I think instead  of withdrawing it, it should have been amended.  Minimum qualification should be  laid down.  A condition should have been laid down that those who were born in  the year 2005 or in the year 2010, when they would turn18 and seek to get a                                              * Original in Tamil.  license, they should have a minimum qualification.  I would also like to bring into  your notice that roads are unnecessarily blocked when people do not get   compensation.  Therefore, a system should be evolved to ensure that   compensation is paid in time. Rajasthan is a desert State which always grapples  with the scarcity of water.  Had the vision of Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayeeji  to  interlink the rivers been realized, the country would have been able to provide  water in drought affected areas for the purpose of drinking and irrigation.  Now the  BJP Government is trying to ensure that water reaches to every farmer's field.  This  Government has provided a budget of Rs.3200 crore for Rajasthan canal.  For the  first time  a large amount has been provided for renovation of canals in Rajasthan.  And also for the first time we have taken up the cleaning of Harike Barrage since  its inception in 1952. Rajasthan is not getting its share of water even after reaching  four inter-state water agreements. I request the Government to provide Rajasthan .6  M.A.F. water which is its legitimate share. The Chairman of BBMB is appointed  from 3 States on rotation basis but it has not been appointed from Rajasthan till  now.  I request that Rajasthan should also get this chance.  The Mukhya Mantri Jal  Swabhiman Abhiyan initiated in Rajasthan is a very good scheme and should be  implemented in the entire country to enhance water conservation.  Another   sensitive issue is that the toxic water from 383 factories is released to Harike  Barrage which is polluting  water in  Indira Gandhi Canal and causing serious  diseases like cancer etc. to the people of 13 districts in Rajasthan including my  constituency.   I request that these 383 factories should be closed immediately so  that the lives of people there are not jeopardized.  I hope the Government would  take steps to ensure that Rajasthan gets its due share of water. The depleting water level cannot be improved  unless  we interlink the rivers in the country.  Today the condition of ponds in the  country is  very pathetic and people are using them as dustbin.  I request that the  beautification of ponds should be done under MGNRGA.  Also, there is a need to  create awareness among people not to use the sources of water as a dumping site.   Besides, the crops should be sown as per their sowing time so that adequate  production could be ensured even by using less water.  My Parliamentary  Constituency Farrukhabad is also facing the problem of Anna cattle who often  destroy the standing crops in the fields.  Legal action should be taken against the  farmers who let loose such animals and leave them to wander.   I request that the  problem of Anna cattle should be addressed properly.  Secondly, if the water  problem continues, the young people will be forced to migrate to big cities in  search of employment because they would  not be able to cultivate  their land due  to scarcity of water.  We all need to pay attention to it.  Immediate action should be  taken for interlinking of rivers.  It will also help in tackling the problem of floods.   We will not be able to save the ground water level without interlinking the rivers. In Odisha, we still celebrate from 6th  of April to 13th of April, those 8 days, as \\u2018National Days\\u2019.  So far as the condition  of the memorial at Jallianwala Bagh is concerned, it is not kept well.  The  photographs have already become very yellow.  I am really thankful to the  Government that they have brought this Bill.      The first Government which came into being after Independence, to form a  memorial and, quite rightly so, Dr. Ambedkar moved that resolution as the Law  Minister, when the trustees pass away without bequeathing the property to  subsequent trustees, that property  becomes an escheat property because ultimately  the escheat property will be vesting with the Government.  During that period, as  many lawyers were part of the struggle for independence, they said that make it the  property of the Congress or form a society where Congress leaders would be  heading that property or society.  That is the way in which in 1951, a memorial  trust was created.  Now, amendments have come and I fully endorse the  amendments that are there with the Prime Minister as the head of the trust.  The  Leader of the Opposition or the leader of the largest party in opposition has been  added in the trust and that is a welcome step.    The massacre of Jallianwala Bagh  reverberated in Odisha.  Utkalamani Gopabandhu Das brought the nationalist  fervour to Odisha as Bhagirath brought Ganga to Bharat.  He dedicated his whole  institution to the cause of Lala Lajpath Rai to the Servants of People Society.  In  every way, this Jallianwala Bagh had an impact on everybody's mind.  That was  the pathetic situation which Punjab went through.  This whole nation bows its head  in memory of those martyrs.  I would request the Minister to build this National  Memorial in a grand way.  The 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma  Gandhi and the centenary of the Jalliawala Bagh happen to fall this year. Through  this Bill, some amendments have been made in respect of the Jalliawalan Bagh  Memorial Trust.  Earlier, President of the Congress party used to be the Trustee of  this trust which is not proper at all. This is a good Bill. Now, the Hon. Prime  Minister would be the President of this Trust and Secretary (Culture), the Chief  Minister and the Governor would be the members.  I would like to urge the  Congress party to welcome this Bill brought by this Government.  This is a commendable budget providing  relief to the citizens of the country. I have certain suggestions to make. The  Government has given income tax exemption to citizens having income upto Rs.  five lakh. This exemption should be increased upto to Rs. 7.5 lakh for senior  citizens. Zero percentage GST on health care services should be introduced. Stamp  duty should be scrapped for home buyers since GST is levied on purchase of home.  GST levied at the rate of 12 per cent on houses should be reduced to 5 per cent  GST levied at 5 per cent on advertisements should be scrapped so as to provide  relief to small and medium newspapers. L.T.C. facility should be provided to the  retired Government officials once in four years. The Government should make  efforts to provide one community centre, one hospital and one primary school in  each village. Toll tax should be scrapped by the Government to free the common  man of this burden. Appropriate measures should be taken to make Delhi pollution  free. 0.5 percent income tax inquiry cases should be withdrawn so as to provide  relief to the common man and income tax officials. I welcome this Interim Budget from the  bottom of my heart. The changes brought about in the CRZ rules by the Central  Government way back in 2011 is far from being complete leading to constraints in  giving a final shape to the reconstruction of settlements not to talk of the sad plight  of the fishermen along the seashore as no amount has been allocated for it.  Due to  the accumulation of garbage along Versova, Andheri  West seashore,  the  fishermen are faced with huge hardships. Under Sagarmala scheme, a corpus of  Rs.80 thousand crore had been sanctioned for clearing garbage piled over here.  I  place my demand for the remaining amount in this Budget.  At the same time, I  would like to thank the hon. Minister for making Andheri to Goregaon harbour line  operational.  Funds should be sanctioned for the expansion of Goregaon to  Boriwali Harbour line.  The METP should be given financial assistance by the  Railways.    The encroachments made on the Central Government's land should be  removed.  The number of pipes of the Mahanagar Gas Nigam should be increased.   A Dak Bhawan at Lokandwala in Andheri West, Mumbai should be constructed.    The exemption in the personal income tax should be given upto Rs.8 lakh per  annum.  All types of necessary facilities should be made available for the  handicapped persons at all the railway stations in Mumbai.  The allocation of funds  for Kaushal Vikas Yojana should be enhanced.  At least one government school  should be opened at the localities inhabited by the Government employees in my  parliamentary constituency.  The sportspersons who play the games like Kho-kho  and Kabaddi should be incentivised under the Khelo India Scheme.  Relief should  be given to 100 employees of MIDC in my parliamentary constituency.  The  services of 130 employees engaged with the Central Fisheries Training Institute,  Varsova in Mumbai should be regularised.  The fishermen should be provided  succour in the event of natural calamities and they should be given facilities in the  export of their produce.  All the pending irrigation projects in Maharashtra should  be completed.  Attention should be paid towards mobile and internet network.   Recruitment should be made for the post-offices.  There is an airport at Juhu in my  parliamentary constituency.  Slums  have come up on the land of Airport Authority  around that airport.  If these slum dwellers are rehabilitated, this airport can be  used for the launch of private flights.  The Government should rehabilitate around  18000 slum dwellers who have been displaced because of the expansion of  Chhatarpati Shivaji Terminus International Airport.  The cities like Kolhapur,  Ratnagiri, Solapur and Satara in Maharashtra should be connected with Mumbai,  Pune and Delhi under the Udaan Scheme. I welcome the  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Yojana.  I request the hon. Finance Minister to remove GST  from the agriculture implements.  Maharashtra Government has made it mandatory  for the farmers to take solar energy connections.  Electricity connections should  also be an option for them.  Prices of onion should be increased.  There is no  mention of development of Vidarbha region in this interim budget.  The  Government claims that it will provide bus connectivity to every village but where  are the roads in rural areas?  I hope, the Government will take forward the river  interlinking project.  The Government has exempted the income of upto Rs.5 lakh  from income tax.  We welcome this move.  I request the Government to levy  income tax at the rate of 10 per cent on the income from Rs.5 lakh to Rs.8 lakh, 20  per cent on Rs.8 lakh to Rs.15 lakh and 30 per cent on the income above Rs.15  lakh.    Ayushman Bharat is a welcome scheme but the hospitals in rural areas are  not fully equipped.  I demand to provide stoppage of Humsafar train at Gondia and  that of Gondavana Express at Tiroda.  There is a need to complete the work of  Sipen-Virar-Narevi to Katangi railway line.  Doubling of railway line is required  between Katangi and Tiroda.  This Government has reduced the budget allocation  under MNREGS.  Village panchayats have been renamed as Nagar Panchayats  without any real upgradation as such the works under MNRGS cannot be  undertaken there.  The Government has announced a pension scheme for the  workers in unorganised sector.  A provision should be made in the said scheme to  provide pension of Rs.3000 per month to the families or the dependants of such  workers.  There is no guarantee that a subscriber to that scheme will survive till the  age of 60.  This scheme should be implemented in both the districts of Gondia and  Bhandara. This Budget reflects mantra of \\u2018Sabka  Saath, Sabka Vikas\\u2019 in which every sector has been taken care of. I would like to  place the following demands for consideration of the Government.  Introduction of  Air services from Chakarbhatha, Bilaspur, the need to set up an Akashvani Kendra  in newly formed district Mungeli (Chhattisgarh), setting up a Railway Tribunal  under Bilaspur railway zone, expediting the works of proposed Kendriya  Vidyalaya, and the need to including Ratanpur (Mahamaya Temple) in Bilaspur  district of Chhattisgarh in the list of national tourist destinations. The Centre has, as expected, presented a pre  election Interim Budget 2019-20 keeping broadly a myopic view of the happenings  around. The situation of agriculture in my constituency Jagatsinghpur, Odisha  needs special attention from the Central Government and more central allocation is  needed for implementation in the district. The Centre has adopted the 'KAALIA'  Scheme but does not admit it. The animal husbandry has not been given  importance in the Budget. I don't think the proposal will benefit the fishermen. For  workers of unorganized sector Central Schemes like 'Aushmaan Bharat, Pradhan  Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana etc. are not so effective at the ground level. For the  Poor and Backward Classes, the Budget proposes 25% additional seats in  educational institutions to meet the 10% reservation for the poor, but it lacks  proper planning, programming and implementing. For the Digital Villages it  proposes to convert 1 lakh villages into Digital Villages over next five years, but  this Scheme will make the same end as that of the 'Sansad Adarsh Yojana'. Proper  and timely monitoring of the Central funds are needed in my district, which this  Budget will fail to achieve. I also take this opportunity to thank the Leader of Biju  Janata Dal, Hon'ble Chief Minister of Odisha for whom I am in a position to raise  these matters in this August House. The Budget offers a lot of optimism and  is a ray of hope for the farmers and the middle class. Whatever has been promised  to the farmers is only with election in mind. There is nothing concrete for the  farmers. The Government should have cut the tax rates instead of increasing the  rebate as it would have helped all sections of the population. There is no concrete  proposal in the Budget for the manufacturing sector. I request the Government to  further strengthen the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana so as to cover price  fluctuation and simplify the claim process. There are certain areas which require  further consideration of the Government and necessary modifications may be  announced to benefit agriculture labour, farmers, middle class employees and  handloom weavers. It is very disappointing that there is no mention of the Special  Category Status for Andhra Pradesh and nor there is any mention about the railway  zone at Visakhapatnam. I would again request for establishment of the AIIMS,  especially in my constituency. I support the General Budget. It  is the first time ever that 95% people of the Country are benefited out of Budget.  There is no section of the society which has not received any benefit in this  Budget. Farmers have been granted Rs. 6000 per year. Income tax rebate is granted  upto Rs. 5 lakh which will benefit 3.5 crore people. The farmers who repay their  loan on time will get 2% more rebate. Bank accounts of 34 crore people have been  opened under Jan-dhan Yojana. Loan worth Rs. 7 lakh crore has been given to 15  crore people under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana. This called Sabka Sath Sabka  Vikas. I have few suggestions- Rs. 3000 pension should be given to workers  including agricultural workers. The proposed amount of Rs. 6000 per year meant  for farmers must be increased to Rs. 12,000 rupees per year. The agriculture must  be made self dependent. Agriculture equipments should be exempted from GST.  The agriculture land must be treated as one unit. A corporation must be established  for crop insurance. The check dam must be constructed and they must be desilted.  We should merge Consumer Affairs, Irrigation, Mining and Forest Ministries.  Irrigation must be brought under infrastructure and it must be prioritize. Special  incentive must be provided to 'Kandi Area'. There must be Cargo system at Mohali  Airport. I demand that a train must be started from Dera Baba Nanak to Pakistan. While supporting the interim Budget 2018- 19, I would like to request the Government to start urgently newly constructed 200  bed hospital in my parliamentary constituency, Lakhimpur Khiri in Uttar Pradesh  and introduction of the proposed Heritage train from Dudhwa National Park to  Katarniya Ghat and start the work on proposed new rail line Palia-Nidhasan-  Belroya. So far 12 interim budgets have  been presented, but it is for the first time that major announcements have been  made like a full-fledged budget, which is violation of the established constitutional  traditions. This interim budget has been prepared to woo the voters in the  forthcoming general elections. There has been steady decline in the growth rate in  the agriculture during the last four years. No work has been done for the farmers  during the last four years and this year, being the election year, it has been  proposed to provide Rs. 6000/- to the farmers, out of which Rs. 2000/- would be  given by the month of March. This is a meagre amount. So I would like to demand  that if the government is really interested in the welfare of farmers, it should give  at least financial assistance of Rs. 50,000/- annually to the farmers. Etawah,  Mainpuri, Agra, Aligarh and Farrukhabad are potato growing areas and potato  farmers are not getting cost price for the last two years. This year the farmers were  somewhat hopeful, but they had to suffer heavy losses due to hailstorm and  untimely rain during the last week. The payment of dues of approximately Rs.  10,000 crore of sugarcane farmers in Uttar Pradesh has not been made till date. I sincerely thank the Hon'ble Finance Minister  for presenting a budget committed to the development of the middle class  taxpayers and poor people of our country.  Our party had demanded that the  income tax exemption limit should be raised from Rs. 2.5 lacs to Rs. 8 lacs.   I  thank the Hon. Minister for raising it to Rs. 5 lacs in this budget, though in part.   Further, my demand to create a separate Department of fisheries has been duly  accepted.  I rise here to support the budget with my request for certain additional  allocations in respect of the overall development of Mumbai to develop it as a  world class city.  I reiterate that a Mumbai Development Plan Implementation  Authority must be constituted by the Central Government.  For a planned and  holistic land development of Mumbai, a special package of Rs. 14,00,600 crores  may be sanctioned and released at the earliest. I request Hon'ble Finance Minister  to allocate Rs. 2,000 crores to BEST for smooth operation of its services.  The real  estate sector must be recognized as a priority sector by the Reserve Bank of India  as well as other banks and given the 'industry' status.  It will ease the project  approval process and attract foreign investments in several forms. BMC is  suffering huge amounts of loss as a result of the abolition of octroi.  I request the  Hon'ble Minister to provide for a fair provision to compensate for this loss of  BMC.  There are certain concerns regarding the leather industry in the Dharavi  area of my constituency.  I request the Hon'ble Finance Minister to duly incentivize  the leather exporter.  The 720km long coastline in Maharashtra provides livelihood  to lacs of fishermen.  The financial condition of fishermen is getting worse with the  increase in the cost of fishing for several reasons.  I request the Hon'ble Finance  Minister to waive off the loan of these fishermen. Mumbai has an overstressed  suburban railway system and hence, to ease it down, we need provisions for  emergency medical care for accident victims, introduction of car rakes to reduce  overcrowding, more FOB and subways to prevent the hazards resulting from  crossing railway tracks, CBTC system for signalling etc.  Due attention has to be  given to Dadar Station.  These measures will require substantial amount of  expenditures, for which I request the Hon'ble Minister for additional allocations. Finance Minister has presented a  very popular budget.  There is a provision to provide Rs.6000 per year to more  than 12 crore farmers in this Budget.  More than 3 crore middle class people have  been exempted from Income Tax limit.  I congratulate the Minister for making a  provision of exemption from income tax on income upto Rs.5 lakh.  The  Government has made all effort to remove the hardships of the people belonging to  all the sections.  Direct tax has  increased through GST.  A large number of tourists  visit my Nalanda Parliamentary Constituency.  There is no airport.  All effort  should be made to provide an international airport there.  A five star hotel may also  please be constructed there with the help of the Department of Tourism. I support and welcome the Interim  Budget presented by the Government. This is a pro people budget.  This budget is  infact a boon for the farmers, labourers, small traders and lower income group  employees. This budget promises 6000 rupees per annum to the farmers holding 2  hectare of land and also allocated 75000 crore rupees for the Kisan Samman Nidhi.  Per month pension of 3000 rupees for the labourers has been decided. Persons  having  Annual Income of Rupees 5 lakh have been exempted from paying tax.  Nearly 3000 crore people are likely to be benefited by this. GST slab has been  enhanced to 40 lakh rupees, turn over slab for the traders coming under 9 percent  have been increased one and half crore and quarterly filing criteria has been  relaxed for them. I urge upon the Government to relax the criteria of land holding  upto 5 hectare for the small and marginal farmers  of Bundelkhand area so that the  farmers holding 5 hectares of land be covered under the schemes of the  Government. I would like to request that special status should  be accorded to Bihar along with the special package. Secondly, educated  unemployed youth should be provided at least Rs.5000 as unemployment pension.   Thirdly, I would like to state that tourism is significantly important for the  development of Bihar.  Similarly, concrete measures should be taken to safeguard  Bihar from the menace of flood.  I would also like to request that a campus of  AMU should be set up at Kisanganj. Apart from that, AIIMS should be set up in  Kosi and Darbhanga.  Also, steps should be taken with regard to Purnia High  Court. The government has taken a number of steps to  double the income of farmers. 22,000 rural haats will be developed into  Gramin Agricultural Markets. All farmers otpu gnivah 2 hectares of land will be  provided assistance of Rs 6000 per year which will be transferred directly into  accounts of the farmers under Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme. The  government has proposed allocation of 200 crore rupees to the organized  agricultural sector and to its ancillary industries alongwith a budgetary provision of  1400 crore rupees for  the food processing sector. People who have a monthly  income of 15000 rupees  or less will be granted a pension of 3000 rupees per  month after attaining the age of 60 years under the Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi  Maan-dhan Scheme.  Under the Saubhagya Yojana steps have been taken to  electrify each household . It is the dream of the Prime Minister that each and every  poor person in the country should own a house by 2022. The government has also  distributed free LPG connections. The seven lakes situated in the hills of the  Rajori-Poonch region need to be developed. Budgetary provision should be made  for further  development of Khwas Gandho ghati, Mandi Budha Amarnath and  Mandi in my parliamentary constituency. Also, provision should be made for  metro rail in Jammu.  Provision should also be made for construction of an  international airport in Jammu. The Central Government has once  again reaffirmed its commitment to the all-round development of the agriculture  sector and enhancing the income of farmers. The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima  Yojna was launched by the BJP Government in January 2016 to provide insurance  support to farmers. I would like to suggest that the government may consider to  eliminate the premium amount paid by farmers for the crop insurance scheme \\u2013  Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. If it is done it would be a great help to farmers  of the country. I would like to know whether the  Government is going to consider this 90:10 allocation of Government grant - 90  per cent from the Union Government and 10 per cent from the respective State  Governments - where there is larger concentration of Scheduled Castes and  Scheduled Tribes.  The State Government of Odisha has been demanding that the  cess should be distributed among the coal-bearing States so that they can invest  that money for pollution control.  I would like to know whether the Government is  going to deal with that in the near future.  In its reply to a Right to Information  query, the Government has said that they cannot disclose black money reports as a  Parliamentary panel is examining them.   This is a very serious matter.  Can I know  from the Minister why he has put a restriction to reveal it among the Members of  Committee? In view of General Elections knocking  at the door, the government has tried to appease the middle class and bring a  populist budget. Every small and marginal farmers has been assured of an income  of Rs. 6000 per annum under PM Kisan Yojana. But this is not sufficient. The  Union Government has failed to copy partially the Odisha Government's Scheme  \\\"KALIA Yojana\\\". In the Kalia Yojana the farmers who are landless marginal  farmers are assured of an income of Rs. 10,000 per annum. Odisha should be given  Special Category Status. But there is no such information in the Budget. There is  no reference to MSP of rice which should be Rs. 2930 per quintal. The Budget presented by the hon'ble Minister  of Finance has been welcomed by people across the country. Allocation of  requisite fund should be made for construction of bypass road from Gaimukh to  Bhiwandi under my parliamentary constituency Thane. Construction work of 2  kilometre long Airoli-Kalwa rail link with the cost of 428 crore rupees under  Central Railway in my parliamentary constituency Thane should be started at the  earliest. CCTV cameras should be installed and provision of escalators should be  made at all the railway stations in Navi Mumbai. The incomplete work of parking  plaza in the Thane station premises should be completed without delay. More  number of local trains should be started on Thane Panvel railway route. The first  passenger train in the country ran between Mumbai to Thane under my  parliamentary constituency on 16 April, 1853. Therefore, this station should be  given the status of historical station and measures should be taken for its  redevelopment. This budget is a historical and  praiseworthy budget.  All the classes of the country have been fully kept in view in  this budget.  Bringing about a major change in the income tax slab, proposal has  been put in place to give tax exemption on income upto Rs. 5 lakhs.  This will give  benefit to three crore middle class families.  A provision has been made in this  budget to directly transfer Rs. 6,000 per annum in the bank accounts of farmers  having agricultural land upto 2 hectares.  This Bill will give benefit to  approximately 12 crore farmers.  The Government is going to launch Kamdhenu  Yojana for cows.  A commission will be constituted for pisciculture.  There will be  interest subvention of 2 per cent for animal husbandry and pisciculture which will  give a boost to employment and farmers' income.  The benefit of Pradhan Mantri  Shram Yogi Maan Dhan Yojana will accrue to the employees earning upto Rs.  15,000.  A provision has been made that a sum of Rs. 6 lakh will be given in case  of the death of a worker.  Besides, an insurance of Rs. 6 lakh will be provided to all  the employees having EPF deduction.  Announcement has been made that there  will be no TDS on the fix deposit interest of banks upto Rs. 40,000 which was Rs.  10,000 so far.  Concrete step is evident to materialize the dream of every person in  this budget.    After five years, provision pertaining  to annual assistance of mere rupee six thousand has been made in this Budget.  As  far as education sector is concerned, Government has not increased the percentage  of GDP to be spent on this sector.  The Government has also not mentioned  anything about sports in this Budget.  I would like to request the Government that  data obtained from satellite system should be used for the welfare of farmers and  fishermen.  Large scale computerization and automation by private companies  have resulted in joblessness.  Similarly, Skill India and Make-in-India programme  have failed.  The Government has not seriously considered about constructing  dams and interlinking of rivers in this Budget.  Apart from that, Smart City scheme  has also not been implemented successfully.  Government should streamline the  process of filing GST and income tax.  I would like to express my gratitude to the  Government for setting up 22nd AIIMS in Haryana.  I thank the government for  initiating an important Bill to set up a Tourism Promotion Corporation of India to  promote and develop tourism in the country. I am from Bundelkhand Region of  Uttar Pradesh. Chitrakoot Dham in Uttar Pradesh is an important place as Lord  Rama spent 12 years of his exile here. Every day, it attracts thousands of pilgrims  from inside and outside the country. A very big fair is held on every new moon day  and millions of people attend it. There are many quaint places near Chitrakoot  region like Kamadgiri Parvat, Ramghat, the holy Mandakini river, Hunuman  Dhara, Gupta Godavari, Sphatika Shila, Laxman Pahari and Valmiki ashram which  need to be developed. The development works are being carried out with the funds  of more than Rs. 125 crore to set up to Ramayan Circuit. No work has been started  in Kalinjar fort for which Rs. 8 crore was given. The work of Rope-way on  Laxman Pahari has also been completed. It is awaiting for inauguration. The  original manuscript of Ramayan of Tulsidas has been kept in Rajapur. I am  grateful to Nanaji Deshmukh who set up Tulsi Peeth and also carried out many  development works there. The entire Bundelkhand region can be developed as  tourist hub which has many places of attraction. Special efforts are required for all  these things. The Chitrakoot region is spread across Uttar Pradesh and Mandhya  Pradesh. It should be integrated as one region and declared as free zone. A railway  halt named as Chitrakoot Dwar should be established at the earliest. I thank the government for awarding Bharat Ratna  to Nanaji Deshmukh. The tourism contributes 9.3% in the GDP of India. A large  number of domestic and foreign tourists attend religious pilgrimage. There are  many areas which can be developed and promoted for tourism. Entire Rajasthan  has big sand dunes. But, we have failed to develop these places. The works have  not been started with the funds given for the promotion of tourism in Rajasthan or  in my constituency or in border areas. The temple of Jaharveer Goga Ji, Ramdevra  temple and Pallugarh temple are among the largest temples of North India. In my  neighbourhood, there is a village named Khatkar Kalan near Navashaher of  Punjab, which is birth place of Saheed Bhagat Singh. The government has not  started any work there. The original grave of Laila-Majnu is also located in my  area. My constituency has a village named Hindumalkot. When Indo-Pakistan war  was fought, it was started from here. All these historical places, temples, old  buildings and place of ancient civilization in Rajasthan should be included in the  list of tourist places and the fund should be provided for their development and  promotion.   I thank the Hon. President for  addressing hon. Members of both the Houses.  But in his Address he has repeated  the same things which have been narrated by our Prime Minister during the last  five years. An effort has been made in the Address of Hon. President to compare  the achievements of this Government with that of the previous Governments.  It  would have been better to mention the ideas of this Government only.  The  Constitution of India has given equal rights to every citizen but this Government  has weakened every Constitutional institution. Reservation for dalits and backward  classes is also being abolished.  Our Prime Minister always asks as to what we  have done during the last 60 years?  I would like to tell him that during the last 60  years, we have enhanced literacy rate, life expectancy, irrigated lands, production  of foodgrains, production of milk, road construction, construction of rail lines,  establishment of colleges and so many things and we have also reduced the infant  mortality rate. Besides, we have also developed so many projects under the Five  Year Plans.  This Government has abolished the Planning Commission.  NITI  Ayog has become a superficial institution. We have established several public  sector undertakings to create jobs and also launched satellite like Aryabhatt.  In the  year 1974, India had conducted a peaceful atomic test. Congress Party has  enhanced the GDP of this country almost 33 times during the last 60 years.  It was  claimed that demonetization would eradicate corruption but poor people suffered a  lot due to demonetization.  Farmers too have suffered a lot due to demonetization.   During the year 2011-12, the rate of unemployment was 3.8 per cent whereas as  per the survey of NSSO, this rate has been increased to 6.1 per cent during the year  2017-18.  According to the data of NSSO, the unemployment rate of rural youth  was 5 per cent in the year 2011-12 which has increased to 17.4 per cent in the year  2017-18.  The rate of unemployment among rural women was 4.8 per cent which  has increased to 13.6 per cent.  Unemployment has increased in almost every  sector.  Trade has been badly affected due to frequent changes in the GST rates.   We have raised the issue of Rafael deal in this House several times but we have got  no reply.  I would like to request the Government to constitute a Joint  Parliamentary Committee in this regard. Growth rate in agriculture sector has come  down.  When this Government can waive the loan of Rs. one lakh ten thousand  crore to benefit corporate sector then why do they not waive the farmers\\u201f loan?   There is a huge scam in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana.  We had electrified  6,32,000 villages during the last 60 years.  The law and order situation in the  country has deteriorated. The prices of petrol and diesel kept falling in the  international market but the Government did not reduce the price.  This  Government has failed to bring the Women Reservation Bill and also reduced the  allocation for MNREGA upto 14 per cent.  Hon. President in his Address did not  utter even a single word about \\u201eBeti Bachao, Beti Padhao\\u201f.  The Government has  put the Lokpal Bill in cold storage.  This Government has only altered the names  of old schemes. This Government claims to have launched new schemes but after  little scrutiny we find that all schemes are old ones and they have changed the  names only.  When Baba Saheb Ambedkar handed over the Constitution to the  nation, he had said that no man can be grateful at the cost of his honour and no  nation can be grateful at the cost of its liberty.   Hero worship is a sure road to  degradation and to eventual dictatorship.  Hon. President in his Address at Para 28  did mention about the Citizenship Amendment Bill. Immediate withdrawal of the  Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2016 is the need of the hour. If this Bill is not  withdrawn immediately the fall-out will be very dangerous and situation will be  out of control. If the Bill is passed in its present form there will arise a huge  demographic challenge in the Northeast in general and Manipur in particular. I  strongly urge upon the Union Government to immediately withdraw the  Citizenship Amendment Bill 2016 in the best interest of all concerned. Address by the hon. President  mainly highlights the Government's policy priorities and the economic plans in the  coming year. It provides a comprehensive framework to the social and economic  agenda of the Government. India is rapidly emerging as a new economic  superpower on the global platform. India is now the 6th largest economy in the  world. Better infrastructure has been the priority of our Government. While  supporting the motion of thanks on the President's address, I would like to draw the  attention of the Government to Uttarakhand where there is immense potential for  development. I would like to make special requests for its all-round development.  There is a need for special strategy for agriculture and horticulture to bring a  change in the social and economic life in the Himalayan states including  Uttarakhand, for which these states need a financial package to set up special  missions under which special focus should be on organic farming, enhancing  production, storage, processing and marketing in horticulture. Steps should be  taken for industrial package for Uttarakhand. I request that while allocating  resources, we should be at par with the North-Eastern States. It is my request that  an economic package should be announced for integrated development of entire  Kedar valley and other disaster affected areas. Along with announcing loan  waivers for the farmers, special steps should be taken to revive the tourism  industry in this area. Uttarakhand has great potential for medicinal education and  research. Establishment of medicinal education and research institute in IDPL  premises will prove to be a milestone. A Herb Research Institute should be  established in Haridwar region. Urgent establishment of the Himalaya Studies  Center in the country is absolute necessity. I urge the Government to construct  Iqbalpur canal in Haridwar district of my Parliamentary Constituency. In view of  the sensitivity of all the Himalayan States, additional battalions of Eco Task Force  should be set up immediately. Local citizens, forest panchayats, voluntary  organizations should be included in awareness activities of Eco Task Force.  International Ganga Museum should be established in Haridwar. In Haridwar, lack  of transport infrastructure causes traffic congestion for hours. In such a scenario,  introducing Metro / Mono Rail between Haridwar-Rishikesh will not only  strengthen the transport system in the area but will also help in establishing it as an  excellent tourist spot on the world map. The Government's commitment to curb the Ponzi  scheme is needed to be acknowledged. I suggest for more steps to finish the so- called Bitcoins/Cryptocurrency scheme. The Government appointed Committee  must come out with final report and recommend that it is illegal. Hon'ble President has made a mention of all  the schemes of the Government launched during its entire tenure.    Swachh Bharat  Abhiyan is a good scheme.  Only 40 per cent toilets were constructed till 2014 and  during the tenure of this Government a 98 per cent increase has been achieved.   But at the same time it needs to be ensured that toilets are utilised for the purpose  they have been constructed.  We need to make arrangement for water in the toilets.   I feel that Ayushman Bharat is the best health scheme of the world provided it is  implemented properly.  This will solve the big problem of our poor families.   Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana and Pradhan Mantri  Jeewan Jyoti Bima  Yojana are other good schemes.  But hon. President also mentioned in his Address  that demonetisation was a defining moment in the Government's war on corruption  and black money.  I have serious objection to it.  In fact, this impacted our  economy in a negative manner.  Our Road Transport and Highways Minister is  doing good road development work.  Everyone appreciates him.  River  connectivity is also the similar proposition.  With river connectivity all our fields  will get irrigation water and drinking water will also be available.  We can check  the losses caused by heavy rains as well as by famine.  This will also check the  suicides committed by our farmers. I would like to point out that in India's  capital majority of Ministries are in shambles and untidy, particularly, Shastri  Bhavan where the Law Ministry and its officers are located. Regarding Hepatitis B  there is need to give wide publicity so that people can be made aware to its  seriousness. Under Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Pariyojana, 4900 Jan  Aushadhi Centres have already been opened. But in Mumbai suburban railway  stations, at least, one Jan Aushadhi Centre should be opened at each railway  station. It would be better if an AIIMS is set up in Mumbai sub-urban.  In  Maharashtra there are lots of people of the Central Government. If the Central  Government gives \\\"No Objection Certificate\\\" a lot of people could be rehabilitated  on this land. In Mumbai suburban trains a lot of Divyangians are commuting in  trains to reach their workplaces. The Government should provide escalators on  every platform at all the railway stations in Mumbai for their convenience. I urge  upon the government to install a Doppler Weather radar with the latest technology  immediately so that fishermen could get advance and accurate weather  information. Under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana which provides credit  facilities for professional and business requirements, the Lead Bank unnecessarily  asks for more documents and adopts delay tactics to sanction loans. My suggestion  would be to open a single window system and provide a simple application form. I  urge upon the Government to sanction a Kendriya Vidyalaya for my Parliamentary  Constituency Mumbai North-West forthwith. The key to India's success is it  diversity. Despite that, we have seen in the last four years violence against SC/ST  people, incidents of atrocities, mob lynching and communal violence increasing  day by day. The President did not mention about the situation going on all over the  country, and did not take any steps to provide minimum support price to farmers as  per the recommendations of Swaminathan Committee Report. In health sector  there is need to improve the doctor-population ratio for providing better medical  facilities in the country specially in rural India.  Due to hasty implementation of  GST there is an adverse effect on economic, on micro, small and medium  enterprises. Each citizen of India is a nation builder and custodian of India' well  being and the legacy we will pass to the coming generations. For that, we have to  ensure compulsory and uniform education across the country. BSNL is the largest State owned  telecom provider in the country. Sindhudurg & Ratnagiri Districts of my  Constituency are costal and hilly areas. Unfortunately, for the last more than 2  months, BSNL connectivity in these two Districts is very poor. The connectivity  from BSNL Towers to consumers is provided through the electricity supply. BSNL  is unable to pay the electricity bills due to which electricity service provider is  disconnecting the electricity supply resulting in the collapse of BSNL services.  BSNL is also unable to pay salaries to its employees.  Due to total mess of BSNL  services, private Mobile companies such as Jio and Airtel etc. are encroaching in  the arena of BSNL. These are not the good signs for this largest State owned  Telecom Company.  I, urge upon the Govt. to take some urgent steps to improve  the functioning of BSNL in the country.   Just by giving the  household free connection under the Ujjwala Yojana and not subsidizing the future  use of LPG cylinders, the high prevalence of usage of wood in rural India is not  addressed.  There has been a record delay in the release of funds to the States under  the Ayushman Bharat Scheme, also less funds have been allocated for the scheme.   The report of Justice Reddy Committee on OROP implementation is yet to be  made public.  The veterans are demanding for annual revision of pension and that  2015 be taken as base year and not 2013.  Army personnel opting pre-mature  retirement must also be eligible for OROP.  There is a need to provide reservation  for Pardhis, ST status to Dhangars and inclusion of Lingayat community in the  OBC category.  Unemployment has increased to 6.1 %, highest in last 45 years.   There is lack of employment under MGNREGA in drought hit regions of  Maharashtra.  I demand the Centre to release sufficient funds to drought hit States,  so that the States can provide more work in these areas. Hon'ble President has not  mentioned about giving special status to Odisha in his address.  I have been  making efforts to set up  metro services in the capital city of Bhubaneswar.  In the  meantime, Monorail should be started immediately to mitigate traffic congestion.   There should be more flyovers in the city as it was announced under the smart city  project.  Hon'ble President  has also not mentioned regarding the Paika Rebellion.   So, I would appeal to the Government to sanction two hundred crores rupees for  setting up of museum, statues and Paika Library. Apart, I am of the opinion that  probe into Rafale deal is also needed. Hon. President has not mentioned about the  request made by the Chief Minister of Odisha to give special status to Odisha.   There should be a flyover from Cuttack to Paradip.  The displaced persons in  Paradip should be engaged in Paradip Port.  An airport and a super specialty  hospital should be constructed in port area.  A metro and monorail should be  started immediately in Bhubaneswar.  Hon. President has not mentioned about the  Paika Rebellion of 1817.  I appeal to the Government to sanction Rs.200 crore  to  set up a museum, statues and Paika library and a flame should be constructed at the  hill top in Khorda.  The innovation of Khorda Fort should be started immediately.   An enquiry should be held into the Rafael deal. The Government should make a comprehensive plan to  do away with all the problems of the downtrodden people.  I want to congratulate  hon. Prime Minister for extending all the medical facilities to the poor and helpless  people.    Negotiations with regard to Assam and Nagaland are going on and  negotiations between underground groups and the Government of India have been  going on for the last 22 years under different successive Governments.  On August  3, 2015 the Framework Agreement has been signed between the Government of  India and NSCN-IM, and we were expecting that solution is going to be there  within this time, but election is knocking at the door and I believe that a final  solution may not take place.  Our Government has taken a lot of  initiatives/programmes for development, but in Nagaland development works are  held-up due to insurgency problems.  I would like to request the hon. Prime  Minister, hon. Home Minister, senior leaders and the Leaders of this august House  to kindly extend all assistance to resolve this Naga political issue. The Government has made tall claims  through the hon. President and has mentioned about the initiatives taken during the  last years or are likely to be taken in future for development and prosperity.  The  Government keeps on reiterating about the Skill India Scheme but it is very  shocking that the youth are not getting employments as claimed.  Today the  situation has become so grave that even the posts of principals and teachers are  lying vacant in Kendriya Vidyalayas.  Whether it is Union Government or the State  Governments, they are promoting none else but contractors and thereby impeding  employment generation.  Money is being squeezed out of the farmers in the name  of the Fasal Bima Yoajana but farmers are not getting  their due amount under the  said scheme.  I would like to know about the Digital India whether any set-up has  ever been developed in order to make a village digitized despite the optic fibre laid   in Gram Panchayats.    Railway claims that all the unmanned level crossings have  been closed down but no under-bridge and over-bridge has been constructed in  Jind  during the last 15 years of the  regime of the Congress and the BJP.  If you  want to see the model of the electrification of hamlets, then you should visit Hisar.   The PMJAY is a very good scheme and in this regard I would like to suggest that  investment should be made therein to implement it properly. Sikkim Democratic Front party supports this Bill.   In fact, the Bill, as it is passed and will flow into the hands of the State  Government for operationalizing the same, will only strengthen the hands of our  Government.  Limo and Tamang communities have got their status as tribals and to  get the reservation in the State Assembly they need to get Cabinet approval and  approval of this House. This Bill makes minority community hailing  from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh viz. Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain,  Christian who had been compelled to take refuge in India for fear of being  persecuted eligible for acquiring Indian citizenship.  The objective of the Bill is  appreciable.  Assam must not be made to bear the burden of any Bangladeshi or  anyone else belonging to foreign territories.  If feasible, the residents concerned  should be deported to the other States.  Those who came here until 1971 have been  settled down here through an Accord.  However, those visiting subsequently  should not be allowed to reside there.  This Bill would jeopardize the identity of  the Assamese.   There is an influx of Muslims from Bangladesh.  There is a good  number of districts in the hilly areas of Assam where Assamese are in minority.   The Government of Assam should provide this community with aid and succour.   With the passage of this Bill, the Assam Accord would be repealed which is likely  to have a severe onslaught on the secular fabric of the Constitution.  Of late, NRC  has been conducted which produced the data of 40,70,707. Through NRC it has  been divulged that so huge a quantum of illegal migrants are there that cannot be  facilitated with National Registration.  Hindus too constitute a fair share of them.   Earlier, NRC had identified as many as 70, 000 people as illegal migrants,  however, only 2,400 of them could be deported.  My submission is that the  Government should embark on a solution taking the views put forward by the  Assam Gan Parishad  and of course the sons of the soil concept must not evade our  attention. This is an important Constitution  Amendment Bill.  The economically backward section of our population is  required to be supported in all respects.  While these kinds of amendments, Bills  and very particularly, Constitution Amendments come, the Party in power would  discuss with all other Parties.  There is a proposal for 10 per cent reservation in  jobs, education etc.  But today, where are those jobs?  The working class of this  country is demanding that the Government should ensure jobs with minimum  salary of Rs. 18,000 per month.  It comes to Rs. 2.16 lakh per annum for the  unorganized workers.  Now, the Government has brought the Bill that reservation  will be given to persons having income up to R.s 8 lakh per annum.  The  Government is propagating that reservation will be given to the other economically  backward persons also.  We have to make this Bill more comprehensive.  This Bill  should be referred to the Joint Parliamentary Committee or Standing Committee so  that there may be more discussion and this Bill may be passed more  comprehensively in this House.  We support this Bill. On behalf of my party, I  welcome the Bill that has been brought in by the Government today. However, I  would like to know what the urgency to bring such an important Bill was.  It is  being passed by consensus but if we had a more detailed discussion it would have  been much better in the interest of the nation.  I appreciate that this Bill is being  passed.  But why has this Bill come in the last Session? I urge this Government to  look into reservation of Dhangars, Kolis, Gowaris and several such communities  who are demanding for it. I on behalf of my party strongly  support the Constitution amendment bill.  However, it raises question about the  manner and the intention with which the bill has been introduced.   I have stated in  this very House a number of times that the caste based census should be done first.  Make it public and provide 100% reservation to all in proportion to their  population be it is forward classes, backward classes, Dalit or scheduled caste  communities.  This bill has been brought for the 10% forward classes in the  country.  They also know the intention and the policy of the Government, which  completed its tenure of       five years with massive majority, to bring this last bill  of their tenure on the last day of the session.  The Constitution amendment bill has  been introduced here.  I have mentioned it to the  Minister of HRD several times  that the manner in which the UGC has changed its roaster system, it seems that the  backward, Dalit, SC and ST communities will not be able to receive  cooperation,  participation and the status of equality in the Universities even in the coming 200  years.  We want the Government to ponder over all these issues to bring equality.  I  have come to know that 24 lakh posts are vacant in Central Government.  We want  that the backlog vacancies should be filled up first. I am happy that reservation is being  provided for the unemployed youth belonging to the upper castes.  However,  reservation is not a remedy for economic prosperity. Only through reservation,  economic prosperity cannot be attained.  It is about bringing a change in the  mentality of people through reservation.  I would like to thank the Government for  providing 10 per cent more reservation in overall reservation.  I would like to  suggest the Government that the reservation may be provided to those on priority  who have studied Government schools.  If this is linked in this way, the  educational system would improve very soon.   A decision may be taken urgently  to set up an All India Judicial Service.  Provision of reservation should also be  made in the private sector.  The barrier of 50 per cent may be broken through a  Constitutional Amendment to provide reservation for the SC/ST and the OBC  communities as per their population. The present Bill seeks to remove  discrepancies in the Aadhaar.  The implementation of Aadhaar has stopped the  leakage in social welfare schemes and saved millions of rupees.  More than 90%  people have enrolled themselves for Aadhaar and only 10% people are left.  The  people who are getting the benefits of the social welfare schemes will not be  excluded if they do not have Aadhaar.  The Aadhaar enrolment process should be  made better to enroll the remaining people.  The banks in my constituency have  been asked to enroll the people.  But these banks should be directed to increase the  number of counters and manpower.  The Bill has made special provisions for the  disabled. The Government has the bounden duty to  explain to this House as to when the Report of the CAG was examined by the  PAC.  The Chairman of PAC is on record saying that PAC has never examined the  CAG report on Rafale.  This clearly indicates that the Government, which is  misusing every institution in the country has even tried to mislead the highest  Court of the country.   I demand the hon. Minister to explain why the Government  misrepresented before Supreme Court.   The Government has eliminated HAL  altogether from the contract and brought in Reliance ADAG.  I request the Defence  Minister to explain this.  There is an audio clip which has gone viral in the social  media.  I question how are the files of sensitive, confidential, secret, classified and  relating to national security, lying in the bedroom of the present Chief Minister of  Goa?  Rafale aircraft is approximately Rs.670 crore and if you calculate the total  for 36 aircrafts, it should come to Rs.24,000 crore. Dassault Aviation clearly says  that the actual price to be paid for 36 aircrafts is about Rs.60,000 crore.  That  means the Government has misled the Parliament and it is tantamount to a  privilege issue also.  When the PM visited France in connection with this deal, who  else were travelling with him and how the cantors of the deal have changed during  those meetings?  I hereby submit that a Joint Select Committee be formed without  any delay, so that the role of the Prime Minister and the Government is enquired in  order to find out the truth of the matter.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":19}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["combined_speeches['Speech'][0]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":178},"id":"5WnsX_jWh57U","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710795619609,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"045_Punerva Singh","userId":"02056743895864260867"}},"outputId":"5555247d-4834-4a0a-d6fc-2ee0e48cfca7"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'Lord Ram is a symbol of dignity.  Lord Shri Ram is the ideal of supreme character all over the world. He is also a  symbol and ideal of social harmony and national unity. Lord Rama incarnated to  organize society. He gave respect to the forest dwellers belonging to the neglected  section of the society who joined his army and he displayed social harmony through  his conduct and awakened the consciousness of love for the people. Some anti-social  elements are trying to destroy the Sanatan values and create confusion. The king  worships the people in the rule of the Hon. Prime Minister. The poor, mothers, youth  and common people are worshipped here. Lord Shri Ramchandra is the epitome of  our faith. He is the identity, pride and self-respect of this nation. On the basis of all  the evidence, the Shri Ram temple has been constructed as per the decision of the  Hon’ble Court. This temple is our National temple and Lord Shri Ram is a symbol  of virtues. Matri Bhakti, Pitri Bhakti, Guru Bhakti, patriotism, sacrifice, and national  effrontery all these find their basis in Lord Shri Ram. The previous Government had  compromised the defence of the nation but our Government, be it Pulwama or Uri,  responded through surgical strikes. We will not tease anyone, but we will not leave  anyone who teases us. The temple was built at the birthplace of Lord Rama by his  son Kush. This temple was destroyed by a foreign invader in 1033. Then in 1528,  the foreign invader Babar sent his commander called Mir Baqi Khan and got the  temple demolished. Efforts were made to free this temple continuously for 500 years.  Those supporting the Ram Temple never carried weapons with them. Hundreds of  Kar Sevaks died in the Ram Mandir movement. It is impossible to imagine India  without Ram. Only Ram can unite this country. When this country was divided on  caste lines owing to the recommendations made by the Mandal Commission, Ram  Temple ushered in unity to this country. It tied the country in the thread of unity.  During the tenure of our Government, this temple was inaugurated and Lord Shri  Ram was also consecrated. Lord Ram was completely non-communal, he  emancipated the fallen and embraced everyone. Lord Shri Ram is the symbol of this  universal sense of values. Our Government also works on the principle of \\'Sabka  Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Prayas and Sabka Vishwas\\'. Unprecedented work has been done during the  17th Lok Sabha under the leadership of Hon. Speaker. We, the Members of all  parties have done a very good job working together. Before being elected to this Lok  Sabha, we contested elections with NDA and we were all elected MPs. But,  unfortunately, our leadership took a different decision after the Lok Sabha polls. We  didn\\'t like that decision from that point on. Later, the Chief Minister of Maharashtra  state decided to join the NDA once again. We have full faith that Hon\\'ble Prime  Minister Modi will fully cooperate in taking forward the ideas of Balasaheb  Thackeray Ji. He fulfilled that faith. He fulfilled Balasaheb Thackeray’s dream of  abrogating Article 370 and constructing a grand Shri Ram temple in Ayodhya. The  17th Lok Sabha is a historic Lok Sabha for us. In the tenure of five years, we have  fulfilled all the promises made to the people like Article 370, Women\\'s Reservation  Bill. I would also like to thank the voters of South Central Mumbai who elected me  here. The way everyone was given an opportunity  to speak in this House, I did not even know how five years of the seventeenth Lok  Sabha passed. Our journey from the old Parliament building to the new Parliament  building has been historic. We have seen so many historic bills being passed here.  Whether it is the matter of triple talaq, the removal of Article 370, the reservation of  women, or replacing British law with Indian laws, for the first time after so many  years of independence, it is a matter of great pride for us. There have been many  sessions in which if the House is disrupted, it causes a big problem and hurts the  heart. The message that reaches the public, especially the youth and young children,  is very sad. My party always believes that no one should come to the well, we always  believe in debates and deliberations. I would like to thank all the leaders and workers  of Biju Janata Dal who elected us here and the people of Kendrapara. I would like  to assure all the people of Odisha who have placed so many expectations on us that  in the coming times also we will work as hard as we have been working to date. While speaking on Ram Mandir, I would like  to say that Lord Ram is not a mere imagination. Lord Ram incarnated 22 thousand  crore years ago. Today Ramayana is more popular than Ramcharit Manas. I have  distributed 51 thousand Ramayana in my Constituency and I have been awarded  with the Golden Book of World Records. Only those who are pure can ultimately  seek God. Hon. Prime Minister is a pure Soul and he is preparing human beings for  living in Ram Raj. While working with keeping God in the conscious, every wish is  fulfilled. It is the wish of the Hon. Prime Minister that responsible youth is groomed  in every village.  This Lok Sabha term has been a very  unforgettable period for me. Big issues like Women\\'s Reservation, Article 370 etc.  were discussed. In these five years, we have learned a lot here. I want to thank all  the Members of our Treasury Benches As well as all our colleagues from the  Opposition for everything. I was elected to this Lok Sabha for the first time.  Everyone held my fingers and explained and taught the practice of this House. In the  17th Lok Sabha, we have had the opportunity to refine ourselves. We are elected  here so that we can represent our people well and work with full force to fight for  their rights in the biggest panchayat of the country, the biggest temple of democracy. After being selected as a Member of this 17th Lok  Sabha, I said in my first speech that my experience is just like that of a new student  when he goes to a new class in school. It is a matter of our good fortune, a matter of  pride that we have got the opportunity to become a Member of the House at a time  when the House has taken such historic decisions, in which indigenous Parliament  was constructed, Article 370 was removed and things like triple talaq were removed.  During the COVID period indigenous vaccine was made and an important decision  was taken on women\\'s reservation and we got the privilege of being a part of it. It  was a privilege to sit here with all the hon.Members.I would like to thank everyone  from the bottom of my heart. Hon.SupriyaSuleji said that the differences should be  political, not personal. I absolutely support it and we also go by the same ideology  that whatever difference you have, it should be political. A personal relationship is  different and we feel that we have made a personal relationship here with everyone,  we have a connection with everyone. I wholeheartedly thank the people of  Samastipur Lok Sabha constituency for giving me the opportunity to be a part of this  House with their blessings. I especially thank Hon. Speaker Sir for  inspiring the new Members of the Parliament and for giving them opportunities to  express their views in the House. 17th Lok Sabha has added many pages of history  during his term which will make our country more splendid. The white paper presented by the  Hon’ble Finance Minister is a very substantial step and the country should know  about it. There is also a discussion going on here to tell the country about it. It is a  very important day because economic reforms are also being discussed. I would like  to thank the Prime Minister who announced to confer Bharat Ratna on the architect  of reforms in the country\\'s economy Narasimha Rao ji, farmers’ leader Charan Singh  ji, and great agricultural scientist Dr. Swaminathan ji. Our Government honours  those who work for the country. When we visit abroad, we should not criticise our  country. India has moved from the \\'fragile five to the powerful five\\'. We have driven  the country from the world\\'s eleventh economy to the fifth economy and will take it  forward to the third position in the next two years. Earlier, a scam used to be  exposed  every week but now the Government is headed by an honest Prime Minister and no  corrupt person will be spared. If someone indulges in corruption, he or she will  surely be punished. During the UPA regime, scams were committed everywhere.  The 2G scam was carried out under the guise of \\'first come first serve\\'. Land was  taken from people in lieu of offering  them jobs in the Railways. Due to these scams,  the confidence of investors in the country was shaken and they started feeling that it  is no longer appropriate to invest capital in this country. But the situation has  changed after our Government was formed. The IMF and the world\\'s largest  companies are saying today that India is one of the best economies in the world.  Now India has received the highest foreign investment. During the Corona  pandemic, under the leadership of the Hon\\'ble Prime Minister, the people of the  country were administered   Made in India vaccine free of cost, which has been a big  achievement. Our Government has improved India\\'s economy and today 25 crore  people have been brought Above the Poverty line. India has made great strides in  the digital electronics sector and it is now the second-largest mobile phone  manufacturer in the world. As far as inflation is concerned, during the NDA regime,  the inflation rate was 3.9 per cent in the year 2004. Moving further, during the tenure  of the UPA, the inflation rate was 9.1 per cent in the year 2009, 12.3 per cent in 2010  and 10.5 per cent in 2011. Likewise, when the NDA again formed the Government,  the inflation rate was 6 per cent in 2015 and today it is only 5.5 per cent. It is a  universally acknowledged data. This White Paper is going to be a milestone in  parliamentary history. Our country is moving forward under the leadership of the  Hon\\'ble Prime Minister because the Government led by him functions with rectitude  and integrity.  The White Paper on the economy  has exposed the dark truth of the UPA. I think that this Paper should be renamed as  ‘Black Paper on Governance. I would like to focus on the reasons behind the  economic and policy stagnancy during the UPA regime and how dangerously it  compromised our economic and social security. A democratically-elected  Government was run by the unconstitutional authorities. I saw the translation of the  dreams of Late Bala Saheb Thackeray ji being fulfilled in this very House when the  Hon. Minister of Home Affairs abrogated Article 370 in this House. Today I feel  that the opposition here is talking about reforms under whose government there was  rampant corruption. In the last 10 years, the incumbent Prime Minister has honoured  all those who were betrayed by the opposition parties while in power. Today we are  passing through Amritkaal and the era of developed India. All our economic  indicators are positive. Our average inflation rate is  5 per cent which was 8.2 percent  during your tenure. Our forex reserves have leapfrogged from 303 billion dollars to  617 billion dollars. Our capital expenditure has increased from Rs. 2 lakh crore to  Rs. 9.5 lakh crore and the Non-Performing Asset (NPA) ratio has come down from  16 per cent to 6 per cent and we are the fastest-growing economy in terms of GDP  growth. Our defence production has crossed Rs. 1 lakh crore today. We built a  defence corridor. Our defence Budget is of Rs. 6 lakh crore. Secondly, we are proud  of our capital expenditure today that world-class infrastructure is being developed  across the country. The length of the high-speed corridor was 500 kilometers which  is 4 thousand kilometres today. The number of airports was 74, which has since more  than doubled to 149.  It is very necessary to present this White Paper  before the country. There was a legion of renowned economists in the UPA  Government, nevertheless, even then they spoilt the economy. We had no such  economists of that calibre, but still, we reformed the economy. During the reign of  Atal ji, sanctions were imposed on India. There was an Asian financial crisis, and  there was a war in Iraq, despite all these crises, Atal Ji\\'s government had given us a  booming economy. The GDP growth rate was 8 percent, the fiscal deficit was around  3-4 percent, and inflation was 3-4 percent at that time. The fiscal deficit was also  around 6-8 percent during the UPA era. During the UPA period, capital expenditure  had come down to 16 percent, which has now again reached 28 percent. The  construction of national highways was only 12 km per day during the UPA reign,  which has increased to 28 km per day during our time. We are confident enough to  say that our economy is of four trillion dollars, it will cross five trillion and ten trillion  too. Our Government has made the banking system very robust. During Atal Ji\\'s  Government, the net NPA was almost reduced to 6-8 percent. The UPA had increased  it to 16 percent. Now the bank NPA remains around 4 percent. Today our banks have  become strong once again after changing the creditor culture through the Insolvency  and Bankruptcy Code. Today, the rupee is one of the strongest currencies in the  world. The stock market which was at 6 thousand levels ten years ago, is now around  22 thousand.  Before 2004, India emerged as a strong economic  power with strong policies of Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, for the first time four-lane  roads were constructed, roads were constructed in every village, Sarva Shiksha  Abhiyan initiative was started. The 5-year tenure after Atal ji was full of scams.  Inflation touched the double-digit mark. During the tenure of the coalition  government, the Commonwealth scam, 2G telecom scam, INX Media scam,  Emerald deal scam, Pilates Basic trainer aircraft scam, Hawk aircraft scam, Adarsh  Housing scam, AgustaWestland scam, Saradha Chit Fund scam in Bengal took  place. The UPA government had only one job, borrow a lot and do not spend that  money on infrastructure, but distribute it to their loved ones. We had no ammunition,  they were not in a position to provide night vision goggles-like equipment. Our  government exported arms and ammunition worth Rs 26 thousand crore. We  manufactured arms and ammunition worth Rs 1 lakh crore indigenously. Today our  government gives the befitting reply to the enemy country. The Opposition has  brought a Black Paper but there is not a single word against our ministers during the  tenure of last ten years. During the 50-year tenure of  Congress government 75 airports were built and in the last 10 years 74 airports have  been built. In  50 years, 98,000 km of roads and highways were built and in the  tenure of this Government, 50,000 km of highways have been built. 400 Vande  Bharat trains are currently running. This government has opened 600 Eklavya  schools for tribal children. 262 medical colleges have been built in the last 10 years,  the government has also set up 17 AIIMS in the last 10 years. Only 16 IITs, in 50  years, and now 7 new IITs have been built in the last 10 years. Through Prime  Minister Awas Yojana, 4 crore people have been given houses since 2014 till date.  Shri Ram Mandir and Kashi were only trailers,  Gyanvapi and Mathura are yet to  come. It is the misfortune of the country that the  Congress Government completely indulged in corruption for 60 years. Therefore,  the White Paper had to be brought. Our government has provided houses to four  crore poor people. Pension was given to 61 crore people. People benefited from  DBT. The number of Jan Aushadhi Kendras increased manifold. Maternity benefit  is given to 3.6 crore people across the country today. The number of metro trains has  also increased a lot. Water facility was provided to every house. The number of start- ups has increased from 300 to 1 crore 70. In 2004, the price of wheat flour was Rs.10  per kg, it was increased to Rs.30 per kg due to corruption. Through the Ayushman  Bharat Yojana, the coverage of Rs 5 lakh is being provided to every poor Person  after the opening of Jan Dhan Account. The House and the country is witness to the fact that  whenever BJP comes into power it has always done good to the tribals of this country.  Hon’ble Prime Minister has declared that the birth anniversary of Bhagwan Birsa  Munda will be observed as Janjatiya Gaurav Divas. If tribal area, tribal forest had  shrunk it was during the rule of previous Congress Governments. Tribals were  evicted, tribal land was snatched and industries were set up. Today, there are more  than 400 Eklavya Residential Model Schools which are likely to increase to 700 by  the end of this year. The present Government has given utmost attention to Extremism  in North-Eastern States and Naxalism in Central India. The tribals are very emotional  and very sentimental and their issue should be tackled accordingly. The tribals can  become good citizens by their inclusion in the mainstream. The ‘Primitive tribe’ word  should be omitted from the dictionary as it is no longer good for society now. The  Sentinel Island in Andaman Nicobar islands is also our tribal area and it is necessary  to bring it in the mainstream and develop that by connecting it to the world. The  Yobin Tribe in Arunachal Pradesh should also be included in Scheduled Tribes. We have seen that through the Swachhta  Abhiyan, air pollution has reduced and the air index quality has also improved.  Thanks to this, Indore is number one in air index quality. The basic mantra of the  government is how to reduce the problems of industries through ease of doing  business. A provision of penalty has been made in this Bill, which is very beneficial  for the industries. The Central Government can also give exemption to some  categories of industries under Section 25 and will also issue advisory to the states in  this regard. Guidelines for the appointment of Chairperson of the State Pollution  Board will also be issued by the central government including guidelines on how the  State Pollution Boards should be run. Another good thing added in this Bill is that  whatever penalty will be collected, that penalty will be used only for environmental  protection. I support this Bill. I support this Bill. It is a  very important Bill because all the people, farmers and animals are facing the problem  of water contamination today. We must establish a strict mechanism to hold industries  accountable for their actions. So, it is essential to implement stringent penalties for  those found violating environmental standards. Promoting pollution prevention  technologies is a paramount need in our efforts to minimise the discharge of pollution  into water bodies. By encouraging industries to adopt the environment-friendly  technologies, we can significantly reduce the impact of pollution on our water  resources. We must prioritise the protection of our citizens from contaminated water.  Utilising penalties collected under this Bill to fund initiatives aimed at de-polluting  water bodies and addressing water-borne diseases is essential. Collaboration between  different Government Departments, agencies and stakeholders is key to the success of  our endeavours. Along with that, establishing a robust monitoring system is essential  for tracking progress and promoting transparency in this regard. The Water Pollution Prevention and Control Cess Act  was enacted in 1977 to levy a cess on water consumed for certain industrial activities.  Saving water, making water free from pollution, control and distribution of water  should be the goal of every countryman. It is also to promote cleanliness of rivers and  wells in different areas of the States by prevention, control and minimization of water  pollution. Under the Act, the SPCB can issue directions to immediately stop the flow  of harmful or polluting substances into water bodies. The officer determining the  punishment should be of the level of Joint Secretary to the Central Government or  Secretary to the State Government. If a complaint has been made by the CPCB or  SPCB or a complaint has been lodged by any person by giving notice to the Board, the  court can take cognizance of the offence. I would like to congratulate the hon. Minister of  Jal Shakti and the hon. Prime Minister Modi ji, because, today the river Ganga has  been rejuvenated from Gangotri to Gangasagar.Under the ‘National Mission for Clean  Ganga’ (Namami Gange), a campaign has been launched to clean not only the river  Ganga but all its tributaries. A new Ministry was also formed in 2019 for this purpose.  There is also a need to release a \\'White Paper\\' on the \\'Ganga Rejuvenation Plan\\'  prepared to clean the river Ganga from 2004 to 2014 so as to find out the utilization of  funds. Chemical, pharmacy, sugar and paper industries cause water pollution. even  ponds in villages have become polluted nowadays because household waste is  discharged into ponds. There is a need to pay attention towards this.  Fertilizer pesticides are adversely affecting the land. Amroha has a large number of chemical  industries. There is a need to pay attention towards this. I want to make a small point  about Baghpat. There are the Hindon and Krishna rivers. There are 122 villages in six  districts. The National Green Tribunal has ordered that the groundwater there has been  contaminated which causes different types of diseases among people. There is an  urgent need to take preventive measures in this regard.  I rise to support this Bill. The Bill  intends to amend the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, of 1974 to  make it more effective. During the last 10 years, the Central Government has allocated  an amount of Rs 774 crore for cleaning the Sutlej river of Punjab and to set up  treatment plants on it. Not a single STP plant has been set up on the Sutlej River till  date. Today, in Rajasthan, we are getting water for Gang, Bhakra and Rajasthan Canals from Punjab. None of the works on STP of the sewage plants in Punjab have  been completed. This law is being enacted to ensure compliance and to provide clean  water to all the states. Sahabi River in Delhi and Mithi River in Mumbai have turned  into drains today. Groundwater has completely depleted in Chennai. One in every nine  people gets drinking water from unsafe sources. 90 per cent of sewage is discharged  into water bodies. Every day 2 million tons of sewage and other waste  are discharged  into water bodies. This Bill will stop all such activities. According to the Central  Pollution Control Board, 61 per cent of untreated urban sewerage is discharged into  rivers and other water bodies. Fluoride and arsenic have been detected in the  groundwater of 276 districts in India. This Bill is likely to bring a change.  Since this Government came into  power in 2014, there has been a lot of improvement in the tax system.  The number of  taxpayers has increased to 2.5 times as compared to the taxpayers at that time. Hon\\'ble  Minister has given a relaxation that the sub-judice, disputed, income tax related  accounts and outstanding demand in departments accounts upto Rs. 25,000 till the  year 2010-11 and Rs. 10,000 till year 2015-16  have been written off through this  Finance Bill and it is a good step. Tax revenue, which was Rs 30 lakh crore in the year  2022-23, has increased to an more than   Rs 38 lakh crore in the year 2024-25 budget  estimates. More and more people are filing tax returns due to the simplification of the  tax system. GST is One Nation, One Tax System.  This has resulted in the increase in  the country\\'s tax revenue significantly. The problem with GST is that the people who  are in E-Marketing have offices in different places. In GST every state has its own  system of registration and a businessman completes the registration process in a state  within 15 days, while in another state the registration is not completed in three months  or even in a year. There should be uniformity for this in the entire country. The interim budget presented by the Union  Finance Minister has a vision of a developed India, the resolve of Antyodaya and the  road map to make New India the growth engine of the world. This welfare budget  reflects the visionary thinking of the government, which includes every citizen, and  every section of the society focusing on the poor, women, youth and farmers along  with the all-round development of the country. The Government focused on  accelerated development by declaring such districts as aspirational districts which  were lagging behind in development, including the Sitamarhi district of my  constituency. More than 25 thousand kilometers of railway tracks have been laid. Rs  566 crore has been allocated for the construction of a 28 km new railway line from  Sitamarhi to Sheohar under my constituency. Today, the world has recognised the  Indian economy as a bright star. This welfare budget presented by the Finance  Minister under the leadership of Hon\\'ble Prime Minister Shri Narendrabhai Modi Ji is  a historic budget with a strong foundation towards building a self-reliant and strong  India.  Our Prime Minister has honoured crores of  us by giving the Bharat Ratna award to Jannayak Karpoori Thakur ji on the occasion  of his birth centenary. This Government has done many such works. I represent the  Patliputra constituency, the land of Chandra Gupta, Chanakya and Emperor Ashoka. It  is the good fortune of India that after two thousand years, the basis of India\\'s growing  economy is the Hon’ble Prime Minister\\'s economic policy, foreign policy and  diplomacy, which is based on Chanakya\\'s policy. In the third inning of the Hon’ble  Prime Minister, when the scope of action against corruption from all sides will be  increased, then India will become the third-largest economy in the world.  The digital  economy stopped leakages in Government schemes. Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana,  Ayushman Yojana, Ujjwala Yojana, PM Kisan Nidhi, Free Ration Scheme, Mudra  Loan, SVANidhiYojana, Electricity, Water, Irrigation, Railways, Highways,  Waterways, has proved instrumental to bring 25 crore people out of poverty line in ten  years due to the rapid implementation of many schemes of the Panchayats funded by  Finance Commission. Whether Lord Krishna\\'s life of self-employment not gives the  message of making oneself self-reliant? I want to tell the youth of the society through  you that this century belongs to India. We now have to move from \\'job seekers\\' to \\'job  creators\\'. Extensive provisions have been  made in this budget for the progress of youth, women, the elderly, small industries and  labourers. The opposition should understand that the more mud you throw, the more  the lotus will blossom. Indian agriculture has become modern and for its  promotion   efforts have been made. The government had also decided to give one and  a half times of the MSP while implementing the recommendations of the  Swaminathan Commission. Under the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi, farmers have  received Rs 2.80 lakh crore so far. Under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana,  farmers paid a premium of Rs 30,000 crore.  In the last 10 years, about 18 lakh crore  rupees have been received by paddy and wheat farmers as MSP. This year\\'s budget  envisages a \\'developed India\\' by 2047 with all-round, all-pervasive and all-inclusive  growth and very important announcements have been made. Every month 300 units of  electricity will be provided free of cost. Three rail corridors will be operational.  40,000 ordinary coaches to be converted into Vande Bharat trains. Female  entrepreneurship increased by 28%. More than 1000 new aircraft were ordered in the  country. Girls aged 9-14 will be vaccinated against cervical cancer. Now all ASHA  workers and Anganwadi workers will get the benefit of Ayushman Bharat. We believe  in empowering the poor. Poverty has come down due to government schemes. With  the mantra of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, the government overcame the challenges and  the economy has got a new strength. I fully support this budget that promotes growth  and inclusive growth. Since 2014, we are also making the country a temple  of development. Today, GST of Rs 1.7 lakh crore is being collected every month. We  strengthened our Banking system. The NPAs which were more than ten percent at that  time have now come down to less than four percent. Our Banking system has become  very strong, on the basis of which our economy is making progress. Everyone knows  about DBT. We Provided Bank accounts to 50 crore people and deposited Rs 34 lakh  crore directly into people\\'s Bank accounts through DBT and about Rs 3 lakh crore has  been saved through this. We have brought this revolution through DBT. It is being  praised all over the world. More than 11 crore toilets have been built under the  Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. We have lifted 25 crore people from extreme poverty. We  are saying this under the Multidimensional Poverty Indicator. Don\\'t just look at the  data obtained from foreign agencies. You also look at the data collected in India. From  2014 to 2019, when we started Amritkal, we achieved second place in the world in  smart phone manufacturing through Production Linked Incentive. We gave  production-linked incentives for solar panels and batteries and today these are being  made in our country. Today we have ordered more than 1000 planes. No other country  in the world has placed so many orders. We have doubled our airports. More than 10  lakh people have got employment through startups. Unemployment has come down to  3.2 percent. Every month 18 lakh crore transactions are taking place through UPI. If  the previous regimes used to make passenger trains, then we are making Bullet Train,  Amrit Bharat and Vande Bharat Train. Three more railway economic corridors are  being built. A Green Hydrogen Mission is going on and we are making biofuels,  which will benefit our farmers. When one crore houses get solar panels under  Suryodaya Yojana, every family will save Rs 15 to 18 thousand every year. We are  also lending top priority to science, technology and innovation. We have millions of  start-ups. Be it space, drones, or agri tech, our start-ups are coming up everywhere.  Our policies are good which is why the investment of venture capitalists and private  equity has gone up five times.  The Government has continuously fulfilled all  the resolve and aims that it has taken since 2014. Our Government is dedicated to the  village, poor, farmers, labourers, mothers and sisters of the country and with this aim  our Government has provided free of cost electricity connection to each household of  the poor under ‘The Saubhagya Scheme’ and more than 13 crore gas connections were  provided under ‘Ujjawala Yojana’. For women empowerment 2 crore sisters were  made Lakhpati didi under ‘Lakhpati Didi Yojana’ healthcare facilities to the tune of  Rs. 5 lakh were facilitated under ‘Aayushman Bharat Yojana’. Grand Ram temple was  constructed in Ayodhya and Kashi Vishwanath, Mahakaal corridor was developed by  the Government. Article 370 and 35A were abrogated, and borders were secured by  wiping out terrorism. By showing gratitude towards the legends of the country their  memorial was built. This Budget clearly shows the way forward for the  Prime Minister\\'s Vision of Developed India by 2047. In 2014, the country was tainted  by the name of Fragile 5. But today India has become the largest and fastest growing  economy in the world. In five years, two crore people were given new houses, three  major economic rail corridors were built and a budget of more than 11 lakh crore  rupees was allocated for infrastructure. The budget of the Defence sector has also been  increased to 3.4 percent of GDP. Now 44 thousand rail coaches similar to Vande  Bharat coaches will be manufactured. Now Anganwadi and Asha workers will also  get Ayushman Bharat Cards. Our Government has provided more than 34 lakh crore  rupees through DBT. As a result, more than 2 lakh 75 thousand crore rupees have  been saved from being misused. Earlier 30 percent of India\\'s GDP used to come from  West Bengal, which has come down to less than 3 percent at present. Today, in the  year 2023, West Bengal has a debt of more than Rs 6.5 lakh crore. In West Bengal,  3.78 crore job cards were issued under MNREGA but as soon as they were linked to  Aadhaar more than 1.5 crore fake cards were cancelled immediately.  The present budget tries to lay a strong  foundation for the future. It lays emphasis on investment in modern infrastructure. A  balance has been struck between investment and fiscal deficit. The focus is on  innovation, and rural development has also been kept in mind. Vaccination for the  prevention of cervical cancer in girls aged between 9 and 14 years is a commendable  step. I express my gratitude to the Central Government for conferring ‘Bharat Ratna’  on a true leader of the Masses - the late Karpoori Thakur ji of Bihar. About 4 crore  and 94 lakh people in Bihar are below the poverty line, the resolve to develop the  country will be fulfilled only when the poor of Bihar also come out of the poverty  line. I demand that the Vande Bharat train should be stopped at Jahanabad station in  my parliamentary constituency. Jahanabad and Arwal districts should be declared  aspirational districts. Arwal should be connected by rail. The previously announced  gas pipeline scheme should be started soon in Arwal and Jahanabad.  I would like to mention the achievements of  tax reforms carried out by our Government. The Direct tax Collection has increased  by threefold during the last 10 years and the number of people filing tax returns has  also 4 times. GST collection has also increased substantially.  It is all because of the  transparency ensured by our Prime Minister.  One Nation, One Tax system has  facilitated the taxpayers.  Under the leadership of our Prime Minister, it is the policy  of our Government to reform, perform and transform.  I would also like to thank the  Hon. Chief Minister of my State for his recent visit to Dullat village has inspired the  local panchayat to take steps to revive the ponds.  I would also like to thank him for  starting the construction of a national highway between Hisar and Sirsa via Khara  Kheri, Badopal and Dariyapur.  It would benefit around 50-60 villages. Due to the all-round development of the country in  the last 10 years under the leadership of the Prime Minister, India has achieved great  success and good fortune to move from the 11th position to the fifth position today.  This Budget is pro-people, pro-poor, pro-women, pro-youth and pro-farmer. This  Budget touches the lower class as well as the middle class of the country. A budget of  Rs. 3.8. lakh crore has been allocated for the eight states of  North East during the last  10 years. It is almost double the budget used to be allocated for the North East before  2014. I would like to give my gratitude to the Hon’ble Prime Minister in this August  House on behalf of the 8 crore people of the North East for establishing peace in the  North East. I specially request the Railway Minister that the Darang district of my  constituency may be connected with the railway line. The work on the National  Highway of Sikkim has been started.  NH-15 has also been approved.  I am thankful  for these works. If a nation needs to thrive to its full potential all  three goddesses’ i.e. Lakshmi, Saraswathi and Durga are equally important. Since  2014, the PM has been leading the nation and giving equal importance to all three  divine elements. Today thousands of kilometers of National Highways are being laid  under the Bharat Mala Pariyojna in every state. This has given impetus to the  developmental works and also created an ecosystem conducive to growth. It has led to  the growth of industries and in turn generating employment opportunities for our  people. Along with job creation, Goddess Lakshmi is blessing our people which is  reflected in the payment of taxes. As far as the goddess Saraswati is concerned, seven  new IITs, seven new IIMs, 15 new AIIMs and 390 new Universities were established  in the country. Apart from this, a separate independent ministry of skill development  too was started. Besides this, the Union government has opened a number of  educational institutions and the National Education Policy was implemented to do  away with the old practices in the system of education. To empower the people of this  country Jal Jeevan Mission was launched. Today, every village in the country  including those in Karnataka has a tap water facility. The Centre has given a lot of  projects to the State of Karnataka. Before 2014, the state had a total length of  Highway at 6,760 km. today we have 13,560 km of Highways. Bangalore-Mysore  satellite ring road is being constructed. The PM has provided whatever was demanded  by the people of the State. Near Bangalore, there is a project named Mekedaatu  Reservoir Dam which is still pending. The project aims to provide drinking water to  the people of Bangalore. The 15th Finance Commission considered factors such as the  population, geographical area and the physical capacity for the allocation of funds. I support this budget. The  Government has changed the condition of this country with its successful  policies.  Our Government overcame the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and  took the biggest step towards a self-reliant India and laid the foundation stone of  “Amrit Kaal”. Under the development programmes, all people were provided with the  facility of housing, electricity, cooking gas and water to every household. Our  Government will work towards more sustainability and more resource-efficient  economic growth in line with the \\'Panchamrit\\' goals. In pursuance of the principle of  \"Reform, Perform and Transform\", the Government will now take up next-generation  reforms. The \\'Direct Benefit Transfer\\' of Rs 34 lakh crore through PM-Jan Dhan  accounts has led to savings of Rs 2.7 crore for the Government.  This saving has  enabled the Government to provide more funds for the welfare of the poor. 78 lakh  street vendors have been provided loan assistance from PM-SVANidhi Yojana. An  immunization program will be launched for girls in the age group of 9 to 14 years for  the prevention of cervical cancer with a focus on “Nari Shakti”. To further the Digital  India initiative of the Government, it was proposed that a new U-WIN platform be  rolled out expeditiously throughout the country. In the Interim Budget 2024-25, it was  also proposed to open new medical colleges. The budget also proposed that ASHAs,  Anganwadi workers and helpers will also be covered under the Ayushman Bharat  scheme. Actual incomes of the people on an average have gone up by 50 per cent and  development programmes and big projects are being completed effectively and on  time. Three major economic corridors identified under Pradhan Mantri Gati Shakti are  to be launched.  The number of airports in the country has doubled to 149 in the last  10 years. More cities have been connected by air routes under the UDAN scheme. Our Prime Minister has resolved to make  India the third-largest economy in the world in the coming five years. The  Government has announced to provide free ration to 80 crore people for the next 5  years in the budget. The Government, through digitalization, has eliminated  corruption in the economy and transferred the funds of the schemes directly into the  accounts of the beneficiaries.  The Government is building a strong nation by  formulating public welfare schemes. Four crore farmers have been provided crop  insurance under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. Under the Skill India  Mission, 1.4 crore youth have been trained and the skills of 54 lakh youth have been  upgraded. Many big enterprises including 3000 new ITIs have been set up in the  country. The implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana continued despite  challenges like Covid.  Arrangements have been made for the construction of 2 crore  additional houses, providing free electricity upto 300 units per month to one crore  families and vendors for installation of charging  stations to  meet the requirement of  electric vehicles  in  the next five years.  It has been decided to increase the target of  \"Lakhpati Didi\" from two crore to three crore for the empowerment and self-reliance  of 83 lakh Self-Help Groups of 9 crore women. I thank the Government for  developing tourist centres and expansion of railway infrastructure projects such as  Metro rail and Namo Bharat in the coming days. This is an all-round, all-touching,  visionary, all-inclusive and progressive Budget. Construction of rail ROB at Bhagwan  Chowk and Chhitabari in Katihar Mukuria railway section of Katihar Railway  Division; Construction of the proposed new four-lane road from Katihar to  Bangladesh border via Bastaul, Rohia-Khopra, Azamnagar, Barsoi, Vighor, Wahin- Makra of West Bengal and Raiganj; immediate construction of road from NH-131A  Manihari under Katihar district to Mahananda River Bridge Nakkati at Ahmedabad  Bengal border for which tender has been awarded; construction of proposed four-lane  road from Kolashi to Dalan Chowk in Katihar district and the proposed new four-lane  road from Pirpainti NH-80 to Phulwaria NH-31 via Kadhgola connecting Bhagalpur  and Katihar districts and construction of bridge may be done in Katihar Parliamentary  Constituency of Bihar. In this interim Budget, works will be carried out on doubling  of railway lines, laying of new railway lines, construction of ROB and underpass  besides the increasing of amenities for passengers in Bihar. This will help a lot in new  Projects. The youth, poor, women and farmers of the country have been transformed  through many Schemes including Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Vishwakarma  Yojana, and Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana. Taking people out of the poverty line is a  major achievement of the Union Government. This is the first budget presented in the  new Parliament House by the Hon. Minister of Finance under the leadership of Hon.  Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, which is an all-inclusive, all-encompassed and  all-round development oriented budget. Under the leadership of the Hon. Prime  Minister, there have been positive changes in the country\\'s economy in the last 10  years. Today every Indian is feeling proud of himself and India is going to become the  third largest economy in the world in the coming times. There has been all-round  development of every person from every section of the country. The implementation  of rural development schemes has been expedited and every public welfare scheme of  the Government has reached the last section of the people. During the Corona  pandemic, free ration was provided to more than 80 crore people and despite the  Corona pandemic, 3 crore Pucca houses have been built under the Pradhan Mantri  Awas Yojana (Rural) along with economic essential supplies. Today, India is moving  forward at a fast pace under the “Atmanirbhar Bharat” scheme, the sales of Khadi and  village industry products have increased by more than 4 times. The number of startups  has increased in the country. India\\'s defence production has reached Rs 1 lakh crore.  Taking decisions in the national interest, One Rank One Pension was implemented by  the Government. 25 crore people in the country have been able to come out of  poverty. The aim of the Union Government is the development of the poor, women,  farmers and youth. Under the Government\\'s Skill India Scheme, 4 crore youths have  benefitted and financial assistance of Rs 43 crore has also been provided under the PM  Mudra Loan Scheme. Women empowerment has been emphasized by the Government  during the last 10 years. By giving 33 percent reservation to women their participation  in Lok Sabha and Assembly has been increased. Under the Lakhpati Didi Scheme, one  crore women have become Lakhpati Didis. The MSP of farmers has been increased by  the Government. 38 lakh farmers have benefitted under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan  Sampada Yojana and 10 lakh employment opportunities have been created.  Recognizing the importance of helping the fishermen, the Government has established  the Department of Fisheries. The three-fold increase in capital expenditure outlay in  the last 4 years has resulted in increased economic growth and employment  generation. I support the \"all-friendly, all-inclusive and all-round\" interim budget of  the Central Government presented by the Hon. Minister of Finance Smt. Nirmala  Sitharaman under the leadership of Hon. Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi.   Ten years ago, India was considered one among  the fragile five but today, it has emerged as the fifth most powerful economy in the  world. Karnataka State has also developed significantly. The Prime Minister has  rewarded Karnataka with various projects such as expressway, highways, new  airports, new railway lines, electrification of railways, smart city projects,  development of urban areas under the Amrut Yojna and the development of rural  areas etc. Thus, in several ways, Karnataka is marching on the path of progress. India  is the root of the tree. The provinces are her branches. Further, the onus of running the  nation is on both the Centre and the states. The “My tax, my right” argument is  against the spirit of the Constitution as well as against the Federal structure of the  nation. The time is ripe to condemn such a divisive and anti-constitutional mentality.  Those who claim to be socialists argue that redistribution of wealth is the basis of  socialism and have won elections on such claims, are talking about “my tax, my right”  issue. If one goes on pressing for “my tax, my right” claim, is it possible to run the  nation or the State of Karnataka? If taking a cue from their “my tax, my right”  argument, the coal-producing states such as Bihar, Jharkhand and others refuse to  supply coal to Karnataka, is it possible to run the country? During the last five years,  Karnataka has been at the top of the FDI chart. The reason is the schemes such as  Make in India, Digital India and the Prime Minister\\'s foreign policy success. All these  initiatives helped Karnataka to progress. So, it is not appropriate to make allegations  against the Union Government which is to function in the federal system. The Prime Minister has shown in 10  years how we can develop our country. The Government led by the famous Prime  Minister of the country believes in fulfilling regional aspirations for the progress of  the country.  I\\'d like to thank the Hon. Railway Minister that one station of our  Badaun Area is also included in the 157 new stations which are being constructed  under the Amrit stations. I would like to thank the Finance Minister of this country,  Hon. Nirmala Sitharaman ji, who introduced the cervical cancer vaccine in this budget  so that our girls of 9 to 14 years of age can be protected from cervical cancer.  Today,  the way the Prime Minister of this country is handling the challenges of the last 65  years during last10 years and putting his energy into nation-building, the day is not far  when this country will be a developed nation.  The Finance Minister has presented a  visionary budget towards making India a developed nation till 2047. The Government  has paid special attention to strengthening the infrastructure of the country. Despite  the slowdown in the world, our current growth rate is around 7.5 percent. Today India  is free from backwardness, poverty and corruption and is making a strong identity as a  strong nation in the world. During the last 10 years, 4.75 lakh km of new rural roads  have been constructed and the length of national highways has increased from 90  thousand km to 1 lakh 46 thousand km. Today there are more than 1 lakh registered  startups in India. About 11 crore households were provided with piped water. More  than 4 crore poor families have been provided with pucca houses. 10 crore women  were provided gas connections under the Ujjwala scheme. Free ration was distributed  to 80 crore countrymen and from 1 January 2024, it was also extended for the next 05  years. The Government has passed the \"Nari Shakti Vandan Act\". Thank you. I rise to appreciate the remarkable progress made  under the visionary leadership of the Prime Minister. The efforts of the Government  have led to a reduction in poverty and made a significant improvement in the financial  condition of households. With the Jan Dhan Yojana, 51 crore bank accounts have  been opened in which total deposits of over Rs 2.1 lakh crore have been made. More  than 35% of these accounts are held by women. It has proved to be a game-changer  for millions of such people. Our Government is working tirelessly to meet the needs  of the coming generation. The Skill India Mission has trained 1.4 crore youths. The  Government has launched schemes like PM SVANIDHI Yojana, which aims to  empower and uplift our informal sector. Large capital expenditure has been invested  in infrastructure development during the last 10 years. The previous year\\'s budget  (2023-24) saw a 37.4% increase in capital expenditure as compared to FY 2022-23.  This huge capital expenditure has led to exceptional infrastructure addition. Other  countries look at our DBT (Direct Beneficiary Transfer) and Unified Payments  Interface (UPI) with great aspiration. All this is the result of Modi ji\\'s foresight and  concerted efforts of his Government. I welcome the all-inclusive and people- friendly Union Budget  to fulfil the resolve of \"Developed India\" during the Amrit  Kaal of Independence. Through this budget dreams of people of every section will be  fulfilled. This budget of Amrit Kaal is a budget that will lay the foundation for  building a developed India. This budget will also be capable of fulfilling the dreams of  the poor, middle-class, aspirational society including farmers and women. The country  is emerging as a global leader and is moving towards becoming a world leader.The G- 20 Summit was successfully organized under the leadership of Hon\\'ble Prime Minister  Shri Narendra Modi.  The government has saved Rs 2.7 lakh crore through the Rs 34  lakh crore (DBT) through PM Jan Dhan accounts. Through rooftop solarization and  free electricity rooftop solarization, 1 crore households will be able to get free  electricity up to 300 units every month. Under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana,  direct financial assistance is provided to 11.8 crore farmers every year. Today we are  very close to achieving the target of about 4 crore pucca houses under the PM Awas  Yojana. In this budget, provision has been made in the budget to construct two crore  additional houses in the next 5 years. Women entrepreneurs have been given a Mudra  Yojana loan of 30 crores. Making triple talaq illegal, one-third reservation of women  in Lok Sabha and state assemblies, and giving more than 70% of houses under PM  Awas Yojana in rural areas to women as single or joint owners have enhanced their  dignity.  Our government is working to further empower the women of the country by  promoting cervical cancer vaccination for girls between 9 and 14 years of age, free of  cost. Further, to extend the benefits of Ayushman Bharat to more people, the scheme  will be extended to all ASHAs, Anganwadi workers and helpers.  There has been a  substantial increase in the number of airports in the country, which has now reached  149. Our Government has laid a lot of emphasis on making the passenger trains safe  and de-congesting the railway system. In order to increase safety and convenience for  middle-class people, a provision has been made in this budget to convert 40,000  normal railway coaches according to the standards of the Vande Bharat train. Apart  from this, 83 lakh self-help groups along with nine crore women are transforming the  rural socio-economic scenario with empowerment and self-reliance. In this interim  budget, a target has been set to increase the target of making Lakhpati Didi from 2  crores to 3 crores.  Under the PM-Kisan Samman Yojana, 11.8 crore farmers are  provided assistance through DBT every year and so far 4 crore farmers have been  provided crop insurance under the PM Fasal Yojana. 1.4 crore youth have been  trained under the Skill India Mission, 54 lakh youth have been skilled and 3000 new  ITIs have been established. This budget is a pro-people budget. Keeping in mind such  all-inclusive development and the lifestyle of the common man, I express my heartfelt  gratitude to the Hon\\'ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and the Finance Minister  for presenting the Amritkal budget of about Rs. 47.66 lakh crore dedicated to the  development of the nation. I have been a Member of this House  for 10 years, which I would call the decade of development and achievements. In  these ten years, I saw the country transform from one of 5 fragile to one of the top 5  economies. On 22 January, the idol of Lord Shri Ram was consecrated in Ayodhya. I  congratulate the Hon\\'ble Prime Minister and the Finance Minister because they have  brought this budget for the development of all sections. This budget is a source of  hope for 140 crore Indians. Budget is not just a game of numbers, rather the  government gives an account to every citizen of this country through the budget where  the hard-earned money is being used and for whom. Today, tax is not a burden but a  contribution of the people – for the bright future of India. In this interim budget, the  Rooftop Solarization Scheme has been announced. Crores of households will get free  electricity up to 300 units and this will save 15 to 18 thousand crore rupees annually.  A housing scheme for the middle class has been announced. Under the leadership of  the Prime Minister, parliament has also passed the Women\\'s Reservation Act which  was pending for 3 decades. The budget also has a provision for the skill development  of 3 crore women through the Lakhpati Didi Yojana. Keeping in view the interests of  ASHA and Anganwadi workers, they have been included in the Ayushman Bharat  Scheme. The youth today are getting stronger through Start Up India and Khelo India.  They will be given an interest-free loan of for a period of 50 years. From Elon Musk,  and Joe Biden to Vladimir Putin, everyone is praising India\\'s development. In the last  10 years, about Rs 18 lakh crore has been received by paddy and wheat farmers as  MSP, which is two-and-a-half times more than that in 2014. The government has  created a Ministry of Cooperation for the first time to promote cooperatives in  agriculture. Despite the global crises, the government kept inflation under control in  the country and did not allow the burden of the common Indian to increase. In the 10  years before 2014, the average inflation rate was more than 8 percent. The average  inflation rate in the last decade was 5 percent. The construction of Atal Setu, which  was pending for many years, was completed. Today, be it MTHL Samruddhi  Mahamarg or Coastal Road, all these projects are being constructed within the time  limit. Today such infrastructure is being built in India, which every Indian dreamt of.  During the last 10 years, 3.75 lakh kilometers of new roads have been constructed in  the villages. The length of national highways has increased from 90 thousand  kilometres to 1 lakh 46 thousand kilometres. The number of airports has almost  doubled from 74 to 149. The number of broadband users has increased 14 times.  About 2 lakh village panchayats of the country have been connected with optical fibre.  A 10,000-km gas pipeline has also been laid in the country. Today, 20 cities have  metro facilities which are limited to just 5 cities. More than 25 thousand kilometers of  railway tracks were laid. This is more than the total railway track length of many  developed countries. Today, Vande Bharat trains are running on more than 39 routes  and more than 1300 railway stations are being transformed under the Amrit Bharat  Station Scheme and all these projects have been completed in just ten years. I welcome and support this interim  budget on behalf of myself and my party. During the tenure of Shri Narendra Modi Ji,  25 crore people have been lifted out of poverty and 80 crore people have been  provided free foodgrains through various schemes. PM Jan Dhan Yojana\\'s account is  an important achievement of the Government. The Government under the leadership  of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has achieved many such achievements. This is  more than any Prime Minister\\'s tenure. Artisans and street vendors are being helped  through the PM Vishwakarma Yojana, PM-SVANidhi Scheme etc. Mudra Yojana  loans are being distributed to women entrepreneurs. 43 crore loans sanctioned under  PM Mudra Yojana. Under the leadership of the Prime  Minister, inflation has come  down economic growth has accelerated and the average real income of people has  increased by 50%. The Government decided to subsidise the construction of 30  million affordable houses in rural areas. Ayushman Bharat Yojana is an important  government scheme meant for the well-being of the people. The Government\\'s  decision to promote ‘Nano DAP’ is a welcome step.The effort of the Government is to  make the country self-sufficient in the production of oilseeds. Under the leadership of  Modi ji, the Government has decided to convert 40,000 general railway coaches  according to Vande Bharat standards, this will increase the facilities of rail passengers.  The Government is taking revolutionary steps in every field such as fisheries, tourism,  aviation etc in the public interest. There has been no change in income tax slabs in the  interim budget 2024. I hope that when a new government is formed at the Centre  under the leadership of Modi ji, a full-fledged budget will come and it will definitely  take care of the middle class. The interest earned on pensions or deposits of senior  citizens should be exempted from tax. Interim Budget 2024-25 is a budget  dedicated to farmers, poor, youth and women empowerment. This budget emphasizes  creating new employment opportunities for the poor and middle class. It guarantees to  strengthen the foundation for the envisaged developed India in 2047. This budget has  a special focus on health schemes, industry and trade, the agriculture sector, farmer  insurance schemes etc. Through this budget, the Government has promised to improve  the economic condition of every person in the country. In the last ten years, the Indian  economy has gained new strength. Our Government has taken long steps towards self- reliant India with its mantra of \\'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwas\\'. In the  last ten years, every household and individual has been tried to be touched through  development programmes like Har Ghar Nal Se Jal Yojana, SAUBHAGYA, Ujjwalal  Yojana, PM-Jan Dhan Yojana and through other financial services in record time.  Free ration to 80 crore people has removed the worry of food. In our Government, the  Minimum Support Price for the produce of the farmers has been increased  appropriately from time to time. Our vision of development is holistic, all- encompassing and all-inclusive. We focus on outcomes and not on outlays so that  socio-economic change can be achieved. For us, there are four major castes: the \\'poor\\',  \\'women\\', \\'youth\\' and \\'annadata\\' (farmers). The Government has helped 250 million  people come out of multidimensional poverty. Using PM-Jan Dhan accounts, the  Government has transferred direct benefits worth Rs 34 lakh crore to the accounts of  the poor, which has helped it to save Rs 2.7 lakh crore. 78 lakh street vendors have  been provided credit assistance through PM-SVANidhi. Our Government is  committed to the welfare of tribals, artisans, disabled and transgender persons. Under  the PM-Kisan Samman Yojana, direct financial assistance is provided to 11.8 crore  farmers every year, which includes marginal and small farmers. Youth and women are  the priority for the Government. The National Education Policy 2020 ushers in  transformative reforms. 1.4 crore youth have been trained through Skill India Mission.  A large number of new institutions of higher learning, namely 7 IITs, 16 IIITs, 7 IIMs,  15 AIIMS and 390 universities have been established. Under PM Mudra Yojana 43  crore loans worth Rs 22.5 lakh crore have been sanctioned for the entrepreneurial  aspirations of our youth. In addition, Fund of Funds, Start-Up India and Start-Up  Credit Guarantee schemes are helping our youth. The highest-ever medal tally at the  Asian Games and Asian Para Games in 2023 shows a high confidence level. Mudra  Yojana loans have been given to numerous women entrepreneurs. Female enrolment  in higher education has increased by 28 per cent in the last ten years. Making \\'triple  talaq\\' illegal, and reserving one-third of seats for women in Lok Sabha and State  Assemblies, shows the commitment of the government. The average real income of  the people has increased by fifty percent. Inflation is moderate. Attention is being paid  to the development of historical and cultural places to promote tourism.The target was  to make 2 crore  Lakhpati Didi, which has been increased to 3 crore. Important  decisions have been taken for the farmers in this budget, which include the use of  Nano DAP, a new scheme for animals, the expansion of PM Matsya Sampada Yojana  and the Atma Nirbhar Oil Seed Campaign.The Government is doing commendable  work in the field of health and public well-being. I urge upon the Hon\\'ble Minister to  take steps to establish medical colleges in the Chatra and Latehar districts of  Jharkhand. Besides, speedy action may be taken to establish a Kendriya Vidyalaya in  the Barwadih block of Latehar district. Six Eklavya schools which have been already  sanctioned for my constituency should be made functional soon. Apart from this,  Eklavya schools should also be opened in different blocks of the Chatra and Latehar  districts. Allocation of funds for the Chatra-Gaya new railway line should be  increased. I urge the Minister of Railways to take concrete steps towards the  completion of the Barwadih-Chirimiri railway line which was proposed before  independence.  Apart from this, approval should be issued soon to extend the  operation of the Ranchi-Tori passenger train upto Balumath and Shivpur. In  conclusion, I would like to say that the interim budget is Modi\\'s guarantee to reduce  poverty, accelerate the pace of infrastructure creation and build a strong, self- confident New India. I thank Hon\\'ble Finance  Minister and congratulate Hon\\'ble Prime Minister for this interim but historic budget.  Keeping in view the large-scale developmental activities of the Government, it seems  that the target of developed India by the year 2047 will be achieved earlier.  This  second budget of \\'Amrit kaal\\' will lay a strong foundation to fulfil the resolution of a  developed India. In this budget, preference has been given to the underprivileged. This  budget will fulfil the dreams of today\\'s aspirational society, village, poor, farmers, and  middle class. This budget is full of possibilities for faster growth, rapidly expanding  new infrastructure, new sources of more investment and more jobs in the country. In  fact, this budget is also going to ensure a bright future for the youth of the country.  This budget is a budget to strengthen the youth, poor, women and farmers because the  Government led by Hon\\'ble Prime Minister has considered them as four pillars of  developed India. The government has allocated Rs. 13,000 crores to the Ministry of  Tribal Affairs in the interim budget 2024-25, which is 70 percent more than the  allocation in the previous financial year. The Government has allocated Rs 6,399 crore  for the construction of Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRS) in 2024-25. The  allocation for Pradhan Mantri Adi Adarsh Gram Yojana has been increased from Rs  300 crore to Rs 1,000 crore. Financial assistance to tribal research institutions has  been increased from Rs 50 crore to Rs 111 crore. At present, 3000 new ITIs have been  opened in the country. About 10 million youth have been trained under Skill India in  the country. At the same time, 15 new AIIMS and 390 new universities have been  developed. Transformational reforms are being made in the National Education  Policy, 2020. Holistic and all-round development of children is being undertaken. In  this budget, loans worth Rs 22 lakh crore have been approved to meet the  entrepreneurship-related needs of the youth. Apart from this, assistance is also being  provided to the youth by the Government in schemes like Startup India and Startup  Credit Guarantee scheme. Youth are becoming job creators. This is a golden period  for today\\'s tech-savvy youth.  A fund of Rs 1 lakh crore will be created to provide  interest-free loans to the youth for 50 years. This will encourage the private sector to  increase research. At the same time, the Government will bring a new scheme for  deep-tech technology keeping in mind the defence needs to establish self-reliance in  the defence sector. The country is feeling proud when our youth have achieved new  heights in sports. The highest medal tally at the Asian Games and Asian Para Games  in 2023 shows a high confidence level. Today, there are more than 80 chess  grandmasters in India. Mudra Yojana loans worth Rs 30 crore have been allocated to  women entrepreneurs. Female enrolment in higher education has increased by 28  percent in ten years. India has successfully led the G-20 Presidency for the world  during a very difficult time. Our country has shown to the world the way to move  forward and build consensus on solutions to global problems. The recently announced  India Middle East Europe Economic Corridor is a strategic and economic game  changer for India and other countries. The trinity of democracy, democracy and  diversity supported by the effort of all, has the ability to fulfil the aspirations of every  Indian. Guided by the principle of \\'reform, perform and transform\\', the Government  will undertake next-generation reforms. The Modi Government is keen to assist states  in the faster development of aspirational districts and blocks. Despite the challenges  posed by COVID-19, the implementation of PM Awas Yojana (Gramin) continued  and we are close to achieving the target of three crore houses. Through rooftop  solarization and free electricity rooftop solarization, one crore households will be  enabled to get free electricity up to 300 units every month. The Government is  planning to setup more medical colleges using the infrastructure of existing hospitals  under various departments. Due to the commitment of the Government to provide  quality healthcare services, 15 new AIIMS have been dedicated in the last 9 years.  Seven new Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), 16 IITs (Triple IT) and 390  universities have been setup across the country. Apart from this, 15 All India Institutes  of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) have been opened. The basic mantra of this Government  is the welfare of the poor and the welfare of the country. By using the PM Jan Dhan  account, the Government has saved Rs 2.7 lakh crore through a \\'Direct Benefit  Transfer\\' of Rs 34 lakh crore. This saving has helped in providing more funds for the  welfare of the poor. PM-SVANidhi has provided credit support to 78 lakh street  vendors. The PM Jan-Man Yojana provides access to particularly vulnerable tribal  groups. PM Vishwakarma Scheme provides ultimate support to artisans and craftsmen  engaged in 18 trades. Under the PM Kisan Samman Yojana, financial assistance is  provided directly to 11.8 crore farmers. Under the PM Crop Insurance Scheme, crop  insurance is provided to 4 crore farmers. The Government plans to introduce  vaccination against cervical cancer for all girls aged 9-14 years in this budget has  shown good intentions of this Government. For this, Rs 90,657 crore has been  allocated to the Health Ministry for the financial year 2024-25. The Government\\'s  flagship scheme, Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PMJAY)  will be extended to Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) and Anganwadi  workers and helpers across the country.  Hon\\'ble Finance Minister has announced the  nationwide launch of the UWIN portal. From the railways\\' point of view, three major  economic railway corridor programmes will be implemented. These are - (1) Energy,  Minerals and Cement Corridors, (2) Port Connectivity Corridors (3) High Traffic  Density Corridors. The aviation sector has expanded in the last ten years. The number  of airports has doubled to 149. Measures will be taken to meet our commitment to  \\'Net-Zero\\' by 2070. A new scheme of Bio-Manufacturing and Bio-Foundry will be  launched to promote green growth. Climate-related activities will be promoted under  Blue Economy 2.0. States will be encouraged to undertake comprehensive  development of spiritual tourism centres, branding and marketing at the global level.  FDI inflows during 2014-23 were 596 billion US$ marking a golden era. The  Government will form a high-powered committee to comprehensively consider the  challenges posed by rapidly increasing population and demographic changes. The  Government has reduced and rationalized tax rates. The presumptive taxation limit for  retail businesses has been increased from ₹2 crore to ₹3 crore. By integrating the  highly fragmented indirect tax regime in India, GST has reduced the compliance  burden on trade and industry. The Government has taken several steps related to  customs duty to facilitate international trade. The Finance Minister has not proposed  any changes relating to taxation and has proposed to retain the same tax rates for  direct taxes and indirect taxes including import duties. The budget has been presented  to bring the plans for the coming 25 years on the ground and implement them, in  which special attention has been paid to ease of living. From every corner of India, be  it those living in inaccessible mountains or plains, farmers or young entrepreneurs  doing startups or developing industrial sectors, every perspective has been included in  this budget. Discussion in respect of granting  SC status to the people of the Valmiki community through the Constitution  Scheduled Castes Order Amendment Bill, 2023 and ST status to the Paharis  through the Constitution Scheduled Tribes Order Amendment Bill, 2023 is going  on. Both of these Bills are very important and historical ones. In Jammu and  Kashmir, the National Conference, PDP and Congress families continued their  plundering and looting for 70 years and deprived the people of Jammu and  Kashmir of the rights conferred upon them by the Constitution. Our Gujars,  Bakkarwals, Gaddis and Sippies had been shouting for their rights for years. They  have now been given ownership rights of the land. Gujar and Bakkarwal were  given political reservation. The demand that the OBC class had beem making for  50 years has now been fulfilled. Earlier, PoK refugees were not given citizenship  in Jammu and Kashmir. Now they have got citizenship and the allied facilities. The  hill tribes living in PoK have been fighting for their rights for 50 years and today  efforts are being made to grant ST status to the tribal people living in the Hills.  \\uf02aDR. D. RAVIKUMAR: This Bill aims to include the Valmiki community  in the list of Scheduled Castes in Jammu and Kashmir. However, there is a need to  make amendments for the entire country. Particularly in Tamil Nadu, the people  belonging to the Baduga community of Nilgiris have been persistently demanding  to include their caste in the list of Scheduled Tribes. This demand was put forth  before the Hon Minister. I request that this genuine demand should also be duly  considered by this Government and appropriate action be taken. During the  Britiskh era, some castes in the Other Backward category were mentioned  disrespectfully. Those names have been amended and corrected by the Tamil Nadu  Government. It is a long pending demand that such cases should be dealt with  respectfully. People belonging to the Adi Dravida community wanted them not to  be called as Paraiyars or Panchamars. I request that necessary amendments be  made in this regard.    Article 370 was abrogated in the year 2019.  During the last 5 years, 58 projects were taken up there, out of which 32 projects  have been completed. Connectivity has been provided by constructing thousands of  kilometres of roads. Over the last five years, 170 new bridges have been  constructed in Jammu and Kashmir. Many road, and tunnel projects have either  been completed or are ongoing. 7 medical colleges, 28 nursing colleges, 2 cancer  institutes, 50 new degree colleges, IITs, and IIMs have been set up in Jammu and  Kashmir. International flights have started operating from the State. After the  abrogation of Article 370, one crore eighty lakh tourists visited the State during the  last three years. 50 thousand people have been provided with pucca houses. In a  State where cinemas and theatres have remained closed for the last 30 years, today  more than 100 shows are run there. During the period from 2004 to 2014, 7217  terrorist attacks were reported from the State but during the last 10 years, the  number of terrorist attacks has come down to 2000. In the year 2010, 2654  incidents of stone pelting were reported and after the abrogation of Article 370  only 4 such incidents came to light. Before 2014, 489 attempts of infiltration were  made, but now the number has come down to 48 only. Around  100 crore rupees  have been seized from 134 Bank accounts belonging to the people involved in  terrorist activities. Hon’ble Prime Minister provided 10% reservation to the poor   belonging to the upper caste without tinkering with the SC, and ST reservation.  Gurjar-Bakarwals got the opportunity to become Members of PDC and DDC. The  reservation should be provided to the people of hilly areas without tinkering with  the reservation for Gurjar-Bakarwals. I rise to support the Bill. First of all, I would  like to thank the illustrious Prime Minister of the country and our DOPT Minister  for bringing forward this Bill. The Bill aims to bring transparency and fairness to  our examinations. This Bill has been brought to create credibility not only within  the country but also across the world. The way cheating is done in examinations,  our country is earning a bad reputation. Ever since I became an MP, I have been  telling everyone that the school or college in which cheating is done, that school or  college is ruining your generation. Don\\'t send your children to such schools or  colleges. Today, the level of our education is going down. Our education should be  meaningful. There are four types of education. Education should be meaningful,  enjoyable, fame-oriented and pleasing. I congratulate the Hon. Minister that he has  brought such a  Bill, under which the punishment is three to five years, five to ten  years, one lakh rupees to ten lakh rupees, one crore rupees to ten crore rupees. He  has made a provision for punishment in the same. Paper Leaks has been called an  organised crime. There should be a section on organised crime in the Bill. Many  years ago, the youth used to pass the examination conducted by the Staff Selection  Commission and became Customs Inspectors. I have seen that 50-60 children from  one or two districts are getting selected. How is this possible? This is not possible  without copying. Some people work in an organised way. Therefore, there was a  need to bring a very strict law on this. We are the second largest producer of PhDs  after China. I have the data for the year 2014. How much difference it has made  after that, I don\\'t know. People used to be awarded PhDs by paying money. People  used to write a PhD for twenty thousand rupees. Such people have also been  arrested. There is a need to promote education in our country. Therefore,  the  manner in which the Hon. Prime Minister is laying emphasis on   innovation and  research, this kind of law is essentially called for in our country , so that no one  will dare to copy or get it done. Such centres need to be shut down, and such  schools and colleges should be derecognized. I support this Bill introduced for fair conduct of  competitive examinations. This Bill seeks to boost the morale of young and  hardworking students in the country. The Prime Minister has repealed 1,500 laws  of the British era. Many such laws which were useless were repealed. Needful  steps have been taken by him in the interest of the country. He has taken such a big  reform step in the interests of the students. In Jharkhand, students were lathi- charged. I request that there should be an immediate inquiry into it by the CBI.  Those who are guilty, even if they are the highest officials, should be put in jail.  The Prime Minister has given such a big gift to the youth and students. I hope that  justice will be done to the students and youth of Jharkhand and such culprits will  be sent to jail by conducting a CBI inquiry. With the introduction of this bill, the deprived  section of the Valmiki community of Jammu and Kashmir will get the benefit of  the government\\'s welfare schemes and will get the benefit of reservation. Dr. Baba  Saheb Ambedkar wrote the Constitution and through this Constitution, every poor  of the country got his rights. But Baba Saheb could not get the respect he deserved.  Under the leadership of Hon\\'ble Prime Minister Babasaheb Ambedkar Ji was  honored by developing five places associated with Babasaheb\\'s life as  \\'Panchteerth\\'. It was an honour for all people belonging to the scheduled class and  all the households of the country. The Valmiki community used to do the work of  cleaning and scavenging in the village. But when the Prime Minister launched the  Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in the entire country and in that Swachh Bharat Abhiyan,  all the citizens of the country were engaged in cleaning with brooms in their hands  and now no one could say to any person that if he/she was a sweeper, then he must  belong to the Valmiki community. Along with this, the work of honoring the  people of all the scheduled castes in the country has been done through various  schemes. We have seen that when the Hon\\'ble Prime Minister inaugurated the  airport in Ayodhya while doing \\'Pran Pratishtha\\' of Shri Ram temple, the airport  was also named after Maharishi Valmiki ji. Through this Bill, the work of giving  rights to the Valmiki Samaj will be done, who were earlier deprived of their rights  and were also deprived of benefitting from various schemes of the state and  Central Government. Our country has greatly increased  the pace of development at the national and international levels in the last ten  years. The government has uninterruptedly provided basic amenities to the people  living at the lowest rung of society. Even amidst a severe global crisis like Corona,  India has emerged as the fastest-growing major industry and our country has  maintained an overall growth rate of more than 7.5% in two quarters. The  government has encouraged private participation in the defence sector over the  years. Apart from this, an amount of about Rs 1 lakh crore has been provided to  ex-servicemen under the One Rank One Pension Scheme. Under the Vibrant  Village Programme, modern infrastructure is being built on all the international  borders of India so that all necessary facilities can be provided in such areas.  India\\'s successful foreign policy is being praised globally. During the G-20  programme, the government has made efforts to ensure permanent membership of  the African Union and has also announced the development of the India-West  Asia-Europe Corridor which will strengthen international relations between India  and West Asia and Europe. Nari Shakti Vandan Act has been implemented to  increase the participation of women in Lok Sabha and Legislative Assemblies.  Self-help groups have been given bank loans worth Rs 8 lakh crore and financial  assistance worth Rs 40,000 crore. Apart from this, now the maternity leave for  women has been increased from 12 weeks to 26 weeks which is fulfilling our  resolve of women empowerment. Our government is working on more than 14,000  PM Shri Schools to provide quality education. Enrollment of SC and OBC students  has increased by 44% and enrollment of ST students has increased by 65%. Along  with this, a law has also been passed to strengthen research and innovation in the  country. Today about 4.1 crore poor families in the country have their own  permanent house. Under the government\\'s Jal Jeevan Mission, piped water has  reached about 11 crore rural families. A total of 11 crore toilets have been  constructed across the country, which has resulted in freedom from open  defecation and the prevention of many diseases caused by it. In order to increase  the income of farmers and improve the agriculture sector, free ration has been  given to 80 crore people since the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and this  initiative has now been extended for the next five years. So far, Rs 2.8 lakh crore  has been given in the bank accounts of farmers under the PM Kisan Scheme.  Under the PM Crop Insurance Scheme, farmers have so far received claims worth  Rs 1.5 lakh crore due to crop damage. Farmers have received approximately Rs 18  lakh crore from the government as MSP for paddy and wheat. Overall inflation  which was more than 8% in the 10 years before 2014, has stood at 5% in the last  decade. The number of people paying GST and filing ITR has also increased much  more than before.  Her Excellency Hon\\'ble President has  highlighted various important issues in her address which reflect the significant  achievements during the tenure of the Hon\\'ble Prime Minister which are as  follows: Abrogation of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir; G-20 Summit was  organized successfully in India; construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya; around  25 crore people of the country came above the poverty line; emphasis on making  farming more remunerative for farmers; for the first time, agricultural export  policy was formulated; 1300 railway stations are being upgraded across the  country; One Rank One Pension Scheme was implemented for soldiers;  construction of the new Parliament building; India became the first country in the  world to hoist the flag on the Moon\\'s South Pole; recruitment in government  departments on mission Mode; Women Reservation Bill ensured greater  participation of women; India has become the world\\'s 5th largest economy; number  of startups in the country has crossed the one lakh mark; mobile manufacturing in  the country registered a five-fold increase; big change from Digital India and more  than 40,000 compliances have been removed for ease of doing business. On January 31, 2024, Her Excellency  the President\\'s maiden Address took place in the new Parliament House. In the first  session of the new Parliament House, a historic decision was taken in the interest  of the women of the country and Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam was enacted and  it was a beginning of a new era by providing 33 percent reservation to women in  the Lok Sabha and Legislative Assemblies of the country. Ever since our  Government came into power, the country has moved towards progress at every  step. The decisions taken by this Government in the national interest have  benefited every citizen of the country. In these 10 years, the Union Government  brought many public welfare schemes. Jan Dhan Yojana, Ayushman Yojana,  Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana and Ujjwala Yojana have transformed  the lives of crores of people and a large section of the country has benefited from  these schemes. We are celebrating Amrit Mahotsav considering the 75th year of  independence. Today we are the fifth economic power in the world and very soon  we will become the third economic power of the world. The aim of our  Government is to provide housing to all. After the G-20 conference, the image of  our country has improved across the world. Today, after years of waiting, Ram  temple has been constructed. The Government has abolished the evil practice of  triple talaq forever. Our country has become the first country to land on the South  Pole of the Moon. The Government has fulfilled a long-standing demand by  implementing One Rank - One Pension. On August 5, 2019, the Government  abolished the special status of Jammu and Kashmir by abrogating Article 370 from  Jammu and Kashmir and divided Kashmir into two parts and made it a Union  Territory. Lakhs of farmers are getting the benefits of Prime Minister Kisan  Samman Nidhi. The Ayushman Bharat scheme is proving to be a lifeline for the  poor. Through this scheme, zero-balance bank accounts of lakhs of poor people  have been opened. Now the benefits of the schemes run by the Government are  directly transferred into Jan Dhan accounts. This great House of Great India is a symbol of  “Ek Bharat, Shreshth Bharat\\'\\'. This House is the House of independent India.  Congress party made the country secular in the name of secularism and divided the  states on the basis of language and they made a mockery of Sanatan culture. Such  articles were inserted in the Indian Constitution that in this country, minorities  were given more rights and the rights of the majority were reduced. We celebrated  the 75th year of the country\\'s independence as Amrit Mahotsav. Lakhs of epitaphs  were written in the glory of our heroes. Ross Island in the Andaman was named  after Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. 21 islands of Andaman Islands were named  after the Param Vir Chakra winners of the country. Veer Bal Diwas was declared  in the name of the Shehzadas of Guru Gobind Ji. Mother tongue was given priority  under the National Education Policy. Indian knowledge system was given priority  within the National Education Policy. Now the time has come to eliminate all signs  of slavery from this country. The name of this country is Bharat, so we should  change its name from India to Bharat again. By the year 2047, we will make our  country self-reliant, fully developed and Vishwa Guru again. After a long struggle  and sacrifices of about 500 years, a grand Ram temple has been built in Ayodhya.  It is the embodiment of the faith of crores of people of this country and it is also  the embodiment of their energy. During the freedom movement, Mahatma Gandhi  used to say that Ram Rajya would be established. Our hon’ble Prime Minister  Modi ji is also continuously fighting and determined to re-establish Ram Rajya in  the country. My parliamentary constituency Baghpat, despite being a part of Delhi  NCR, was far away from development. It was suffering backwardness for decades.  But, today there are 5 national highways, there are medical colleges, central  schools, and CGHS hospitals. Doping in the sporting world is a bane  not only for India but for the whole world. Owing to doping, the meritorious  sportsperson do not get their due place. India is doing its level best to emerge as  a sporting superpower but doping is checking its way forward. It’s a matter of  regret that India happens to be one of the top three anti\\xaddoping violators. This is  a serious matter and needs to be resolved at the earliest and this Bill has also  been brought in to address this serious issue. The World’s Anti\\xadDoping Agency  had long been exerting pressure on NADA to frame a law against doping. The  proposed Bill intends to make this law as a preventive law instead of making it a  criminal law. This legislation will check the athletes from indulging in doping  and will also penalise them for any violation including disqualification from the  sporting event results, seizure of medal, marks, award, disqualifying the sports\\xad person from participating in sporting events for a certain period of time and  imposition of financial sanctions. With the passage of this legislation, the  powers of the NADA will be increased  and sports\\xadpersons will also be  empowered against doping. The decisions of the NADA panels could not be  challenged in the court of law. This is indeed a good effort to frame an effective  law against doping in the country. This Bill indeed is one with a  difference. No hon. Members from both sides have objected to the contours of  the Bill. This is the beauty of the Bill. There is absolutely no place for doping  when we talk of sportsmanship. In 2005, we signed the UNESCO international  convention. We have to be in line with the needs of different countries.  Actually, this was ratified on 7th November, 2007, by India and that is why we  needed to have legislation. The World Anti\\xadDoping Agency brought out a report  in 2009 which brought to notice 152 cases of anti\\xaddoping rule violations.  Unfortunately, 17 per cent of those anti\\xaddoping violations related to India. That  is a major concern and that is why this Bill is very important. The Bill  streamlines the doping control measures through creating the required  institutions and empowering them. It clearly shows that the Government has  zero tolerance towards doping and lays down what would constitute anti\\xaddoping  rule violations. We all need to commend the efforts of the hon. Minister of  Youth Affairs and Sports and his entire team for having worked on this  particular Bill. I support the National Anti\\xadDoping Bill,  2021. NADA should not be used only to punish athletes or prevent them from  indulging in doping, but it should also be used to educate the youth of India in  this regard so that we can create awareness amongst them. Young athletes come  from poor societies, so they should understand which supplements or elements  should be taken and which should not be taken. NADA should be used not only  in domestic, national or international events but also in privately sponsored  competitions. Innocent people do not use such things intentionally, but in most  of the cases they are implicated. There should also be rules to protect them from  it. I want to tell the youth not to indulge in doping, taking drugs and consuming  these useless things at all. The Indian Judiciary probably has the largest  backlog of pending cases in the whole world. This is not a problem of the  system.  It is primarily because of the size of population that we have.  The  number of marriages is also exceedingly high, and it is probably the highest in  the world. As per the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG), there are around 4.7  crore cases which are pending before the courts. Out of this, 11.75 lakh cases  are pending in the Family Courts. The regular courts are basically burdened  with civil and criminal matters, and little or no attention is given to family  matters.  But things are changing because judicial reforms are being looked into  by this Government since 2014. The  Law  Commission  suggested  the  establishment of Family Courts for early disposal and settlement of family  matters.  Based on the suggestions of the Law Commission and basically to  decongest those trial courts, the Parliament passed the Family Courts Act in    1984, and the edifice of this Act was built on two strong pillars, the first pillar  being to promote conciliation and the second pillar being the speedy settlement  of the marriages disputes which are basically brought in front of the Family  Courts. The present amendment of 2022 is necessitated by the case of Onkar  Sharma versus the State of Himachal Pradesh which has already been discussed.  Now, it is important to mention here that the verdict delivered by those courts,  especially Nagaland in 2008 and Himachal Pradesh in 2019, needs to be  validated by an Act of law which has to be passed from here. This Government  has identified the problem. The first step towards a solution is the identification  of the problem. Family Courts are a step in the right direction. A family is the  foundation of our culture and our civilisation and the preservation of this family  unit needs to be looked after. The Family Courts Act was  passed in 1984 to make provisions for establishment of family courts by the  State Governments in consultation with the High Courts for amicable settlement  of family disputes related to marriage. The necessity of this amendment was felt  when a criminal revision petition no. 180 of 2021 was filed in the High Court of  Himachal Pradesh by a person, challenging the authenticity of the judgments of  the family court since it has no sanction from the Central Government  notification which is a prerequisite under Section 1(3) of the Family Courts Act,  1984. The purpose of the Amendment Bill is very limited for incorporating  enabling provisions of the family court of Himachal Pradesh and Nagaland,  where family courts are functioning without issuance of Central Government  notification which is the mandatory prerequisite as per Section 1(3) of the  Family Courts Act, 1984. This Government honours the women in the best way.  Hence, I support this amendment and appeal all the Members of this House,  cutting across party lines, to support this amendment. The Union Government  approved the textile sector Production Linked Incentive (PLI) program last year.  The scheme provided incentives worth Rs. 10,683 crore over a five year period to  boost the manufacture. With the right policies in place, new, expensive and exotic  fabrics can be developed from natural fibers, promising high return to the farmers.  Especially, in our state, the weaving of Patnulu Khadi, can be turned into a thriving  enterprise. Navodaya Vidyalayas are spreading light of  education at the village level. This success is attributed to the teachers serving in  Navodaya Vidyalayas. These teachers are working 24 hours in the school  campuses leaving behind their family and society. It is request that teachers and  staff joining Navodaya Vidyalayas before January 1, 2004 may be covered within  the provisions of old pension scheme. The Bill seeks to provide for provisions  against financing of proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and their delivery  system so as to fulfill our international obligations.  Terrorist financing and financing for  proliferation of weapons of mass destruction can result in loss of reputation in the  international market, loss of donor functioning, loss of foreign direct investment and loss  of credibility for the financial sector.  Therefore, identifying, assessing and understanding  proliferation financing risks on a regular basis is very much essential.  In this direction,  India reaffirms that disarmament is a primary goal of Chemical Weapons Convention and  should remain a priority till the complete destruction of all chemical weapons is achieved.   India is a responsible nuclear weapon State and is committed, as per its nuclear doctrine,  to maintain a credible, minimum deterrence with the posture of no-first-use and non-use  against the non-nuclear weapon States.  The present Bill is in our national interest and in  accordance with our international obligations. I am on my legs to  support the Weapons  of Mass Destruction and their Delivery Systems (Prohibition of Unlawful Activities)  Amendment Bill, 2022.Our country is witnessing a rise in the terrorist activities in which  many Indians lose their lives. Terrorist activities are happening not only in our country  but all over the world. In such a situation, bringing this bill by the Government with an  intention to establish peace and security in the world is a welcome step. The 17-year-old  law of the year 2005 has been amended for the first time through this bill. This Bill is  intended to curb the illegal use of weapons of mass destruction, such as nuclear,  radiological, chemical, biological and other equipment. An important decision has been  taken by the National Security Council in the United Nations to amend the 17-year-old  law and move towards a new direction by bringing new suggestions. All countries should  exercise restraints and should not take illegal action. Terrorist activities should not be  supported, nor encouraged and rather it should be banned. India is sending out a message  to the entire world through this bill that it is high time for the weapons of mass  destruction to be eliminated. I rise here in support of this new amendment Bill.  In  fact, there is a need to amend the said Act to provide against the financing of proliferation  of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems so as to fulfill our international  obligations.  The Bill would give the Government of India powers to freeze, seize or  attach funds or other financial assets or economic resources owned or controlled wholly  or jointly by such person.  This amendment Bill shows the deep commitment of the  Government of India to our counter-terror measures.  This Bill seeks to prohibit financing  of any activity in relation to weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. To  prevent such financing, the Bill empowers the Centre to freeze, seize or attach funds,  financial assets, or economic resources. The need of this Bill was felt to fulfil India’s  international obligations and I congratulate the Government for bringing this Bill.  A horrendous tragedy is unfolding in Ukraine since  24th February, 2022.  After 40 days of war, 4 million people have been displaced, over  4,000 civilian casualties have taken place and indeterminate number of armed personnel  both Ukrainians and Russians have been killed in the conflict.  This conflict in Ukraine  will redefine the global world order just as World War-I, World War-II and the Cold War  did.  So, we may be once again witnessing to a new history being created in the world.   But, who is responsible for the situation in Ukraine?  Undoubtedly, the first coercive step  was taken by Russia, but Russia has been a trusted friend of India and it has been a long- standing ally.  But then, friends also have to be told if they are wrong.  Ukraine also  unfortunately, it seems, miscalculated.  They should have been far more sensitive to  Russian concerns and the eastward expansion of NATO.  Thus, under these  circumstances when the world seems to be in a flux and even around India there seems to  be turmoil, I would like to commend the Government.  The Government so far has been  very cautious and circumspect.  Unfortunately, the geopolitical situation as it has evolved  post the collapse of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe has also made India take a  position going back three decades.  Under these circumstances, I would like to  recommend to the Government that the strategic autonomy, the Nehruvian principles of  nonalignment are the principles that are worth going back to.  However, I would once  again like to commend the Government for extricating Indian students from an extremely  difficult and precarious situation. The Trinamool Congress, normally intends  to extend support to the Government‟s decision when it is related with matters of external  affairs.  We are concerned about those medical students who have come back from  Ukraine.  The attack on Ukraine by Russia is a disastrous step.  Nearly 3,000 civilians  have been killed or injured in this war.  The cost of direct damage to Ukraine‟s  infrastructure amid Russia‟s ongoing invasion has reached almost an estimated figure of  63 billion dollars.  We expected that the war would be stopped.  But it did not.  India‟s  responsibility was aimed at evacuating the Indian citizens from Ukraine and it did so.  It  was a good step.  We can initiate dialogue to end the war.   There is no question that the Non-Alignment  Movement, which has been the bedrock of our foreign policy for the last 75 years-plus  has stood us in good stead, has given us great respect world-wide and has managed to  keep us deftly clear of many conflict situations wherein otherwise there was a potential  for us getting roped in. I commend this Government for having continued the same policy  and even giving credit where it is due sometimes. There is something that India will have  to strongly consider on at least two or three issues. Firstly, the Western World as well as  our Quad partners in the East, has come together on one platform and therefore, there is  some degree of isolation that India possibly has to contend with on that score. That is a  matter of some concern which, I have no doubt, the Government is fully mindful of.  Secondly, now clearly the Russia-China axis is going to be formidable axis. With Russia  Being very much dependent on China virtually for its existence because with the kind of  savage sanctions that have been imposed and these sanctions are going to go on for a very  long time.  if we look at the humanitarian situation and the  evacuation, I think there is no doubt that we are all incredibly grateful for the success of  Operation Ganga and the return of some 23,000 Indians, mainly medical students, back  home in India. The fact that we registered the students was useful, but we did not have  enough domestic transport arrangements in Ukraine. A lot of the students had to walk  very long distances to get to the border points eventually and that is something we will  have to bear  in mind for future situations. I do want to mention one more good thing  which is the timely and appropriate humanitarian aid that India has sent to Ukraine. I  congratulate the Government for having taken that initiative. Broadly speaking, a couple  of unfortunate statements were made by people associated with the Ruling Party during  the travails of our people. These statements really reflect poorly on the commitment of  our nation to our people stuck in distress abroad. First of all, I would like to start by saying that it is  a failure of the United Nations. The United Nations continues to fail this world. I would  like to thank the Government for bringing our children back from Ukraine. It is very easy  to say that we should play a mediation role in the situation today where two major  powers, America and Russia are at loggerheads. Russia felt threatened. This is what we  should not ignore. It is essential that the war must end. How do we end it? I would  request the Foreign Minister and through him, to the hon. Prime Minister, that we must  take major steps, not small steps, but major steps in de-escalating that war and finishing  that war. Unless we do that, we will not be able to tell the future generations that India  played its part. We are friends with America and we are friends with Russia. We are not  enemies of any of these countries. It was because of the foreign policy of keeping neutral  with friends on all sides that we could move forward and take this country from out of  poverty and bring it to the level of a developed country. Therefore, my request to the  Foreign Minister would be, please move faster so that at least people will say that  Gandhi‟s nation has saved this world. We are judging people -- who is  right and who is wrong. But truly, what is really right in any war is something I have  never understood. I would like to thank the Ministry of External Affairs for doing a  wonderful job during the COVID pandemic and then, executing „Operation Ganga‟  successfully. One thing that the Ministers should not have done was the jingoism that  came at the end of it.  It was very painful. We are not doing any favour to our children by  bringing them. They are our children. I think, it is very unfortunate to judge our children.  Children look for opportunities. We, in this House, must make sure that we do not make  unfortunate and callous statements in regard to our children. What I would like to  highlight in this entire discussion is the Russian military imports and in the foreign  policy, we constantly talk about Atmanirbhar Bharat. There are a lot of Indian companies.  There is one company which happens to be in my own Constituency, Bharat Forge,  which really wants to work in defence exports and making India Atmanirbhar. It is „new  order world‟ which has come up. We will very soon have to react and see how  indigenous company products need to be brought out and all our Indian companies to be  helped. First of all, I would like to thank Hon. Prime  Minister and the Minister of External Affairs, Jayshankarji and his team for safely  evacuating everybody from there. This operation was named Operation Ganga. This  operation was carried out on the humanitarian ground. Wherein, the Government of India  has provided assistance to bring back not only Indian citizens but medical students and  citizens of many countries including Pakistan and Bangladesh from there. About twenty  three thousand medical students were brought from there. Among them, 13 students from  my parliamentary constituency were also pursuing study in Kharkiv. Four of these  students were evacuated and the Ministry of External Affairs did a lot of work to bring  the rest of the students from there. India should play an active role to end Ukraine and  Russia war. I am honoured to participate in the  discussion on the Constitution (Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes) Orders  (Amendment) Bill, 2022. These socially deprived people live a precarious life, unable to  still fulfil their bare necessities of life. Although our Constitution has provisions for  reservation for these socially deprived people, they have benefited from reservation only  in a limited manner. But we need to put in efforts to make these people become a part of  mainstream society. The Bill seeks to remove Bhogta community from the list of  Scheduled Castes and include it in the Scheduled Tribes list along with other  communities . Inclusion of more castes and making laws are not enough. More funds are  required to be allocated. Most importantly, implementation is to be looked after.  Numerous innocent Adivasis have lost their lives by being mistaken as Maoists. The hon.  Minister must look into the matter of the undertrials and their current situation. The  tribals have witnessed continued encroachment upon their resources both at individual  and community level. This needs to be stopped immediately and the lands that were taken  away from them should be handed over to the original landholders. Finally, I would like  to mention here that under the leadership of our hon. Chief Minister, the Government of  West Bengal has largely been successful in abolishing Maoist activities by implementing  several developmental projects. Women from Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe  communities are receiving Rs. 1000 per month under the „Lakshmi Bhandar‟ scheme. It  is a symbol of women empowerment. People above the age of 60 years are also receiving  Rs. 1000 under „Jai Johar‟ scheme, which is meant for Scheduled Tribes, and „Taposili  Bandhu‟ scheme, which is meant for Scheduled Castes. Finally, on behalf of the All India  Trinamool Congress, I support this Bill. After the passage of this Bill, I can say with full  confidence that the officials of the Investigating Agency will get a huge success in  securing the conviction.  This Bill has been brought to replace the 102 years old  law.  This Bill should have been brought long ago.  This Bill will not only help in  achieving higher conviction rate but will also help in curbing criminals and crime.  In  today\\'s era, the scope of crime and criminals has become unlimited.  Their modus  operandi is changing.  If the Investigating Agencies are not enabled then it will be a very  difficult task to control the crime.  It is the need of the hour that the Investigating Agency  should use new techniques and collect the evidence in a scientific manner.  It is in this  background that this Bill has been brought.  On the report of the Law Commission and in  the light of the directions of the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court, this task was given to NCRB  and was asked to review the proposal.  Accordingly, NCRB held meetings with the  officials of the States and the Union Territories.  It submitted such a report that all are of  the same view in expanding the scope of measurement and increasing the number of  persons whose measurements can be taken.  Everyone is of the opinion that its scope  must be  increased.  Whatever amendments were made in it by different states, there was  is a huge difference, so this Bill has been introduced in this House to make it a  Comprehensive and Uniform Law. The Law Commission in its 87th Report  candidly said that the Act of 1920 deserved amendment or replacement. The obsoleteness  of the law can be gauged by the fact that there has been increased crime rate in the  country and marginal increments in the conviction rate. On average 7, 50,000 cases have  been closed by the police every year in the last five years due to lack of evidence. This    kind of feeling that there has been no consultation preceding the formulation of this draft  is absolutely far from the truth.  All concerns have been taken on board.  Thereafter, this  particular Bill has been formulated.  This particular Bill is not just coming up in India.  UK, US, Australia and Canada are also working on the same line.  This particular Bill  aligns with the ICJS.  I would like to inform this august House that ICJS is a national  platform for enabling integration of the main IT system of the Home Ministry used for  delivery of criminal justice in the country with five major pillars: police, e-Forensics, e- Courts Courts, e-Prosecution, and e-Prisons. The proposed Bill affirms Government‟s  commitment to strengthen the criminal justice system of the country, to use the  technology in the best possible manner and ensure speedy delivery of justice.  I stand  here to support this Bill whole-heartedly. When I read this particular Bill and the provisions  therein, I have to confess that it was a case of „better late than never‟.  The Law  Commission had recommended widespread changes.  Many States tried to bring about  piecemeal changes or amendments to the Identification of Prisoners Act of 1920.  These  States include, West Bengal, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.  The last  case was of Karnataka in 2021, when they sought to expand the definition of  „measurement‟ and to include DNA voice, and iris scans.  However, the Bill was reserved  by the Governor for the consideration of the hon. President of India because it was felt  that the Bill was repugnant with the Act of 1920.  A 1920 Act which provides for only  fingerprints, footprints and photographs is not the way to deal with crime and criminals  of the 21st century.  We cannot expect our police to be equipped with tools of early 20th  century to deal with crimes and criminals of the 21st century. The modern techniques and  the modern technology greatly facilitate and enhance the quality and quantity of criminal  investigation.  I would like to conclude by saying that no society is perfect, nor is ours.   There are deeply held biases and prejudices embedded in our social consciousness.  Our  police is a product of its social milieu and as such is far from being perfect.  However,  that does not mean that we do not empower it with requisite powers and instruments.   There is an undeniable need to strike a balance between protecting an individual‟s  privacy and giving the police the tools, they need to keep us safe. We say that we should compete with  the big countries and come to their level. So, in this matter also, we should try to get to  their level. The culprit must be punished. I think there should be some strictness in the  rules and regulations in this country to give justice to the people. Then, there will be less  crime and criminals in our country. The present Bill is an advanced step to decrease the  workload of courts and investigative agencies. The proposed Bill is an advanced form of  identification with available advanced technologies. In Maharashtra, police are taking  action against innocent people. The proposed Bill is just, fair, reasonable and proper and  it perfectly maintains balance and right of privacy. I wholeheartedly support this Bill. Our  government is working to end crime.  The subject of inclusion of our Gond community,   Dhuria community and Kharwar castes from the Scheduled Caste to the Scheduled Tribe  list was pending for years. Our Government has certainly done a very good job for the  tribals of the country. About 130 years ago, during the British period, there was a census  of the Gond community, Dhuria community and Kharwar community. There should be a  fresh census today again because they are tribal people. It is the priority of our  Government that the culture and heritage of the tribal communities of the country are  conserved. To fulfil the resolve of the welfare of tribal people and for bringing them into  the mainstream of the country, our Government has increased the budget for them by  12.32 per cent. On behalf of the tribal people of the country, I thank the Prime Minister  and the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. After this Amendment, the people belonging to Gond  and Dhuria communities in these four districts, will get all the benefits of the Scheduled  Tribes.   I rise to support the Constitution (Scheduled  Castes and Scheduled Tribes) Orders (Second Amendment) Bill, 2022. This amendment  is mainly deals with the people from Gond caste. This is not an ordinary Bill. This is a  tribute to those unknown martyrs and unsung heroes who have never ever been known in  the country. Chandoli is a tribal dominated area. So, I would like to urge the hon.  Minister to initiate the process of inclusion of  Kharvar and Cheron in the list of Schedule  Tribes so that justice may be done to them also. I would like to support this Bill  presented by the hon. Minster. The Union Government under the leadership of the hon.  Prime Minister has been committed for the upliftment and the development of the  Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Communities. I am constrained  to speak out that a number of people from Matua community of West Bengal are being  subjected to repeated atrocities by the West Bengal Government. Hence, necessary steps  should be taken to check the incident of atrocities. The issue which is being discussed today under Rule  193 is a very important for our country and at the same time poses serious challenge  before it. Climate change is such a challenge that will stay with us for decades to come. I  thank the Hon\\'ble Prime Minister and Hon\\'ble Environment and Forest Minister that  India showed amazing leadership in the COP-26 conference in Glasgow and a historic  announcement was made therefrom that India also has to move towards \\'Net Zero\\'. This  announcement made by the Hon’ble Prime Minister brought about a paradigm shift in the  transformation of the country. This has changed the development model of the country in  a way. This is going to be a very impressive and positive development model for us.  Today, the whole world is serious with regard  to the issue of climate change.  India leading from the front, adopted 8 national schemes  in the year 2008.  The Paris Summit was held in the year 2015 on the subject of climate  change and India’s role in this conference was hailed by all.  The most powerful country  of the world, the US withdrew from the Paris accord but India led from the front and took  so many initiatives.  India made a commitment in the Glasgow summit that it would  increase its non-fossil based energy production up to 500 GW by the year 2030.  I would  like to draw the attention of this august house to the fact that when the developed  countries tried to pressurize India on the issue of coal, then, our hon. Minister  safeguarded our national interests by giving apt replies to them and I think he deserves all  kudos for it. I would like to appreciate the efforts of the  present NDA Government in promoting the importance of fitness amongst the masses.   The Fit India Movement and Khelo India has led to a revival of sporting culture and  sports infrastructure in the country.  Today, professional bodybuilding is booming across  the country.  But, bodybuilders do not receive any kind of assistance from the  Government.  So, it is my earnest request to the Government that financial assistance may  be extended to our bodybuilders too.  Similarly, due to the lack of proper rules and  standards laid down by the Government, anabolic steroids have found their way to the  youth of India.  Unregulated gyms also perpetrate the induction of youth in steroid type  drugs.  So, not regularizing it and not setting forth the correct standards and requirements  can have the adverse effects on budding sportsperson.  I would also like to say that our  journey with fitness and fitness sports as a country is not recent.  But, over the time, we  have slowly forgotten our roots in fitness sports.  Mallakhamb is one such example of  sport that has been forgotten.  The Government has already recognized it but still it needs  more support and more recognition. The work of our Government to carry out  ‘Khelo India’ programme in the form of a campaign is extremely commendable. A play  ground should be developed in each gram panchayat of the country. Only woman coach  should be appointed to attract daughters towards sports. Rajasthan has a very large  number of talent and they should be given opportunity and government assistance. The  budget of the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports has been hugely increased. The  Government is running programmes like Khelo India and Sansad Khel Spardha. It is  necessary to train women sportspersons by selecting them through special process. In all three corporations, about Rs.8,900 crores  are spent annually on one lakh, twenty thousand employees and the three corporations  generate annual revenue of Rs.6,700 crores. It is estimated that after unification, about  two hundred crore rupees will be saved. In order to solve the problem of economic  condition of North, South and East MCD, salary of thousands of employees working in  MCD, Central Government is unifying MCD, which is commendable. Due to their  unification, the authority and economic condition of the Municipal Corporation will also  be strengthened, this will increase the working capacity of the corporation. It is expected  that the facilities will improve and the common people will be benefitted. With this bill,  the Municipal Corporation will also not have to depend on the Central and Delhi  Government in the matter of revenue. The Municipal Corporation is likely to receive  about Rs 12,000 crore as revenue per year, while its expenditure is estimated to be up to  Rs 10,000 crore. There is a problem of unpaid salaries of employees for a few years, it  will almost end. In Delhi, about two crore people would normally get the benefit of any  public welfare scheme. Due to integration, the capital of the country will get a strong  municipal corporation and wasteful expenditure will be curbed and civic facilities will  reach the public in an easy way. I support this bill. I think this bill is a gift of humanity to the people of  Delhi. Delhi is number one in pollution, Delhi is number one in dirty water. Pension has  been stopped in Delhi for five years. During Covid time, the Prime Minister sent free  ration. You will be surprised to know that no new ration card has been made here for  seven years. The ration was not distributed among the poor, it got rotted lying in schools.  This Bill was much needed at this time in Delhi. This will prevent unnecessary  expenditure, the corporation will be able to take decisions on its own action plan, the way  for their implementation will be cleared and the people of Delhi will get the services of a  corporation that is transparent, corruption free and strengthens the development works,  the schemes pending for years will be accelerated. And the corporation employees will  not have to kneel at the door of any CM for their salary for months. I support this bill. I rise to support the Municipal Corporation of Delhi  (Amendment) Bill, 2022. I request everybody to have faith in democratic system and  support this Bill brought by the Government.  I am of the view that it is necessary  to bring changes in the law from time to time. As far as this Bill is concerned, we cannot  say that this Bill will affect the autonomy of the Institute. The member will be appointed  by the Government on the basis of the recommendation of the panel. Also, through this  amendment, a provision has also been made that the disciplinary process will be  completed within a period of one year i.e. 365 days. Apart from this, now the  Disciplinary Director will also have to submit his report in respect of any complaint so as  to ascertain it is actionable or not. A provision pertaining to time limit has also been  made in this Bill. Now there is no need to even get a primary opinion in any complaint  related matter. If any authorized person makes a complaint with evidence, that complaint  will be treated as a report. This is a major change. Along with this, another provision has  been made that if disciplinary action is going on against anyone, then its full details will  be put on the portal.  I would like to thank the  Government for bringing this much-needed amendment. Several audit failures have  resulted in a number of cases that seriously affected the economy including the recent  Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFC) crisis. The Amendment is necessary and it  provides for several measures to bring the house in order. Such measures include  provisions for speedy time-bound disposal of cases and strengthening of the disciplinary  mechanism amongst others. Further, the manifold increase in penalty and provision for  imprisonment would act as a necessary deterrent against fake professionals. I have a few  suggestions. CA members with their expertise and domain knowledge should be given  preference in disciplinary forums for better and speedy disposal of cases. Thus, it is our  humble suggestion that the strength of CA members should be increased in the  disciplinary forums and a CA member should act as the presiding officer. I would like to  say that I believe that the Amendment is a step in the right direction. It will further make  the functioning of ICAI more cohesive and would, indeed, strengthen the corporate  governance, audit quality and reporting of key statutory documents in the country. About three and a half lakh CAs work in India. But,  none of our best practices is recognized internationally because of lack of a Disciplinary  committee. Our people from software industry lead the world. We have these many CAs  and our audited statements are not accepted in NASDAQ or accepted worldwide because  certain best practices have not been followed. In UK, lay members, that means, members  who are not CAs, head the disciplinary panels. Where a medium scale to a large  corporate company is concerned, it has to have the services of all three- a CA, a cost  accountant as well as a CS. A coordination committee helps in making sure that the best  practices are followed and the companies are rightly advised. I would like to compliment  the Ministry of Corporate Affairs for bringing this Bill. The only issue here that remains  to be seen is whether the Chairman should be from among the CAs themselves or from  outside. There needs to be an oversight body. The autonomy is nowhere being impinged  by the Government. President\\'s Address is important from  many points of view. This Government has benefited the people through various  schemes, such as the Jan DhanYojana, in which crores of new Bank accounts were  opened, which gave impetus to economic inclusiveness and the Ayushman Bharat  Scheme, which provided financial assistance to the poor families for their treatment.   Through Jan Aushadhi Kendra,  medicines are being made available at affordable rates  all over the country and through \\'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao\\', scheme, the importance of  education of the daughters of the country and awareness on this sensitive issue has  increased.Our Government has worked to celebrate their birth anniversaries like a festival to pay homage to all those  great men of history.The evidence of India\\'s capability in the fight against COVID-19 has  been witnessed in the Covid vaccination programme. We have set a record of  administering more than 150 crore vaccine doses in less than a year. Due to the sensitive  policies of our Government, the health services in the country are now within easy reach  of the common man. The government has reduced the cost of treatment by providing  medicines at a lower price through over 8,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras. More than 80  thousand health and wellness centres have been opened through the \\'Ayushman Bharat  Yojana\\'. Many new AIIMS have been set up at many places in the country. Many district  hospitals across the country have been upgraded to medical colleges to meet the shortage  of doctors. The government has set up the National Institute of Mental Health  Rehabilitation in Madhya Pradesh. Under the PradhanMantriKrishiSinchayeeYojana, 64  lakh hectares of irrigation potential has been developed in the country with the help of  various projects and Atal Ground Water Scheme. The inter-linking of rivers has been  done.  In Madhya Pradesh, all the railway stations were renovated. Smart Cities were  upgraded. Under the UDAN scheme, airports were built in many cities. Under the  Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, the government is giving free ration to all  the poor every month. Through Pradhan Mantri Garib KalyanYojana, 80 crore  beneficiaries were provided free food grains. Our government thought about the  inconvenience caused to the citizens living in the village and formulated such schemes,  which would lead to the development of the rural area. To understand a constitution, it is necessary to  understand its preamble, in the same way, to understand the policy or intentions of any  government, as outlined in the Hon\\'ble President\\'s address, it is necessary to understand  the development made by the government. In the last seven years, the work that has been  done under the leadership of the hon. Prime Minister in NDA-1 and NDA-2, the  development is not visible to the friends of our opposition or they do not want to see that  development. During this period, respected Gadkariji gave funds for the construction of  ten thousand kilometer long roads in my Lok Sabha constituency. We are trying to speed  up the development of my Ahmednagar Lok Sabha constituency, which was backward,  by giving such a huge fund. The biggest decision taken in the last one year under the  leadership of the hon.  Prime Minister is that the Ministry of Cooperatives was set up at  the Center, which was never done after independence.  UPA-I and UPA-II governments  had all cooperative sugar factories closed. Our government has revolutionalised the sugar  industry. Ethanol blending program is a unique program of the government. We are  trying to make farmers self-reliant through Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana. Rashtriya  Vayoshree Yojana has been implemented to make available the essential items to the  senior citizens in the country. The Central Government reduced the excise duty on petrol  and diesel by Rs. 5 and Rs. 10 respectively but the Maharashtra government did not  reduce the VAT even by a rupee. However, they reduced excise duty on liquor.  This is  not clear where the funds provided by the Government to the Maharashtra Government  under the Pradhan Mantri Aawas Yojana - Urban are being utilized. The Government has  implemented several schemes like Ayushman Bharat, Digital India, Swachh Bharat and  Ujjwala Yojana. The Government of India and its able  leadership is exploring the honour and  the progress of this country. The brothers and  sisters of our country have received 150 crore vaccine doses in this corona epidemic.  While running the Dausa kitchen in my parliamentary constituency, we arranged food for  one and a half lakh labourers, the disabled and the hungry.Even today, in the State of  Rajasthan, atrocities are being committed against women and daughters. I am a  Scheduled Tribe woman. I know that for 60 years, the Government tried only to get the  votes of SCs and STs. If any work has been done for us, it has happened during the last  six to seven years. The word „prayas‟ has been added to “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas,  Sabka Prayas” so that all the people work together in their respective provinces, regions  with the policies of the Government, then undoubtedly this country will again become a  golden sparrow.In the 60-year rule, three crore seventy five lakh people had accounts in  banks. Today, there are forty-eight crore accounts in banks. Today, the entire money goes  to the beneficiary\\'s accounts. In Rajasthan, 66 lakh farmers received the 12th instalment  of two thousand rupees each on January 1.I have connected the farmers of about 40  villages in the vicinity with hi-tech agriculture, organic agriculture and horticulture,  because we have acute shortage of water and I myself train and explain which crops need  less water.Procurement at four times higher MSP has taken place this year. The 15th  Finance Commission\\'s money was kept in its account by the Rajasthan government for 11  months. They didn\\'t  give the sarpanches even a single rupee. When I raised the issue in  Parliament during zero hour, after 11 months, they got money.In the name of women  empowerment, if we look at the women farmers, 80 per cent of the labour is done by  women. These women are so capable that they are undoubtedly moving forward by  taking advantage of the policies of the government. I support the Motion of Thanks on the  President\\'s Address.  In the times of pandemic in India, production of vaccine in the country, Ayushman  Bharat health infrastructure, more than 80 thousand Health and Wellness Centres and  Ayushman Bharat Card, Jan Aushadhi kendras, the first in the World, establishment of  WHO Global Centre of Traditional Medicine in India, rise in the export of Ayush  Gatishakti Rashtriya Master Plan, extending the length of National Highways, self  reliance in defence production and bringing back the priceless heritage in the country is  commendable.   Pucca ghar to poor, toilets in the houses and rural houses have been connected to  potable water. Swamitra Yojana has been implemented, record increase in agricultural  exports, development of irrigation capacity through Atal Bhujal Yojana and forex reserve  has seen rise. Through welfare schemes such as Ujjawala Yojana and Beti Bachao, Beti  Padhao cause of women empowerment has strengthened.   My request is that unemployment ratio should be curtailed, Construction, Tourism,  Hospitality sector should be given boost for maintaining balance in Economy, MNREGA  budget should be increased for enhancing employment opportunities, work should be  given to urban poor, GST share of Bihar government should be released at the earliest,  Bihar should be given special status, Karpuri Thakur ji should be awarded Bharat Ratna  and caste census should be conducted. During pandemic around 80 crore people of the  country were provided foodgrains under Pradhan Mantri Anna Yojna. Street Vendors  were benefitted through Pradhan Mantri Svanidhi Yojna, Pucca houses were provided to  around 3 crore poor families and for the year 2024 funds for constructing houses were  allocated. Poor families are getting benefit under Ayushman Bharat. LPG connections  were provided under Ujjwala Yojana. Each and every village was electrified under  Saubhagya Yojna. Youth were trained through M.E.S.M.E. So, the overall development  of the country is certain under this Government who believes in welfare for all. We have fought the corona pandemic  firmly  and did not cause economic and  physical damage to the country.  The vision of  the Government for the success of the country‟s UPI platform in the context  of digital  India and the  growing expansion of the  digital economy are praised in the address. India  has once again  become one of the  fastest growing  economies of the world due to the  continuous efforts  of the Government.  Due to the policies of the Government, today,   India is among those countries  where the cost of internet is the lowest. The cost of smart  phones here is also lowest. India has emerged as the second largest mobile phone  manufacturer in the world.   We have crossed the record of administering more than 150  crore vaccine doses in less than a year. Our Government is especially conscious of the   security of the country and the  Government has a special focus on self reliance in the  defence sector.  Make in india has been given priority in  87% of the products during  2020-21.   The contract for manufacturing of 83 LCA Tejas fighter  aircraft has been  signed with Aeronautics Limited and the  Government has taken significant steps to  convert the ordnance factories into 78 defence PSUs.  A netwok of roads is being laid  continuously  for the development of the country. Also green corridors  are being built.    The expressway is nearing completion to bridge the distance  between Delhi- Mumbai  which will be the longest and accessible expressway  in the country. The success and  popularity of Khadi has also been mentioned. Due to the efforts of the Government, the  sale of khadi in the country has increased three times as compared to 2014. India‟s  foreign reserve is 630 billion $. The  foreign investment and exports are also increasing  rapidly. Record crops have also been procured  by the Government from the farmers and  new means are being created to  increase the income of the farmers.  The Government  is  also making efforts like organic farming which is very successful and farmers are also  getting immense benefit  of this method of farming. Our Government is also taking many  necessary steps to harvest rain water.  One lakh eighty thousand  crore rupees have been  given to more than 11 crore  farmer families through Pradhanmantri Kisan  Samman  Nidhi.  Under Pradhanmantri Gramin  Awas Yojna, more than 1 crore houses have been  approved.  The 3rd dose of corona is also being given to the youth. The Government is  promoting Ayurveda. Since 2016, more than 60,000 start-ups have been established in  the country in 56 different sectors, creating 6 lakhs new jobs.  Our Government is  running Pradhanmantri Swanidhi Yojana for street vendors. The citizens of the country  are getting benefited from the schemes like PM Awas Yojana.  The Government is  continuously working to strengthen the rural economy and the farmers of the country. I support the Address of H.E. President which  highlights the concerted efforts of the Union and the State Governments, local  administration, doctors, nurses and health workers, scientists and entrepreneurs who  worked as a team during the Corona period and it is a unique example of their mutual  trust, coordination and cooperation. The success of achieving the target of administering  more than 150 crore vaccine as a campaign in less than a year has ensured safety of  citizens of the country in addition to lifting their morale. The three indigenously  manufactured vaccines to be used in emergency have also got the sanction of the World  Health Organization. The Government is providing free ration every month to every poor  household under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana in the wake of shortage  of foodgrains as a result of Corona. In a bid to maintain the dignity of the poor and  safeguard their livelihood, the Government is running PM Svanidhi Yojana. This scheme  is also proving to be quite useful for the street vendors. In addition to it, the Government  has set up E-shram portal to safeguard the interest of the labourers. The Government has  taken several measures to develop historical and pilgrim places of the country with a  view to pay obeisance to the great personalities and freedom fighters on the occasion of  \\'Amrit Mahotsav\\'. Through the Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana the  Government has provided electricity in each and every rural household. In a bid to  provide free electricity connections and meters to crores of families, the Government has  launched \\'Saubhagya Yojana\\' and provided shelter to the poor through its free housing  schemes. The Government merits appreciation for the success of Krishi India and UPI  platform for the growing use of digital economy. Pradhan Mantri Ayushman Bhara  Health Infrastructure Mission is praiseworthy for addressing the health related current  problems and preparing the country for future crisis. The hon. President\\'s Address  reflects the main target of the Government of uplifting the living standard of farmers, the  poor, the deprived, Dalits and tribals and facilitating all inclusive development which  amalgamates modernisation and technology. First of all, I support the Motion of  Thanks to the President\\'s address.  The country has become the pillar of the fastest  growing economy today.  Our NDA government has registered the record of  administering more than 150 crore vaccine doses in less than a year.  The vaccine being  made in India has played an important role in safeguarding the whole world from the  pandemic and saving the lives of crores of people.  Under the Pradhan Mantri Garib  Kalyan Yojana, free ration is being provided every month to all the poor so that no poor  should remain hungry due to this crisis caused by Corona pandemic.  Many other welfare  schemes are also being run.  I commend the vision of the Government for the success of  the country\\'s UPI platform with regard to Digital India and the growing expansion of the  digital economy.  The Government of Shri Narendra Bhai Modi has taken several  historical works in the education and health sectors in the last seven years. The total  length of national highways in our country was 90 thousand kilometers in the year , 2014,  whereas today its length has exceeded 1 lakh 40 thousand kilometers and under  Bharatmala project, work developing highways of more than 20 thousand kilometer  length underway at a cost of Rs. 6 lakh crore, in which 23 green expressways and green  field corridors are also being developed.  Indian Railways is also undergoing rapid  modernization including the new Vande Bharat train and 24000 km of railway route has  been electrified in the last seven years.  The work of laying new railway line and  doubling is also going on at a brisk pace. The countrymen are  motivated to achieve their goals as soon as possible to build an all-inclusive, all- beneficial, empowered India and the country\\'s self-reliance like basic important  resolutions despite the challenges of Corona\\'s difficult times. With in the Program against  Covid-19, India is today one of the leading countries in the world by providing 150 crores  vaccine doses. The Prime Minister Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission,  which is an important mission, launched by the government at a cost of Rs 64 thousand  crores, will help in meeting the current health needs, will also prepare the country for  future crisis.  Under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, the government is  giving free ration every month to all the poor.  The world\\'s largest food distribution  program is being run in India today with an expenditure of Rs 2 lakh 60 thousand crore to  distribute food grains to 80 crore beneficiaries for 19 months.  The government considers  the ideals of Baba Saheb as its motto and the government\\'s faith is in the basic mantra of  Antyodaya, which should also incorporate social justice, equality, respect and equal  opportunities.  In the policies of the government, top priority is being given to villages,  the poor, the backward, the scheduled castes and tribes.  With the continuous efforts of  the government, India has once again become one of the fastest growing economies of  the world.  Due to the policies of the government, today India is among those countries  where the cost of internet is the lowest.  The government is moving towards building a strong,  secure and inclusive India.  It has been decided to constitute a high-powered committee  for structural reforms in the agriculture sector, an investment of Rs 25 lakh crore to  increase productivity.  Women empowerment is the top priority of the government and  many steps have been taken in this regard with the cooperation of the states.  The  government is providing housing and health facilities to the poor because poverty can be  removed only by empowering them.  In order to give more impetus to the work of  infrastructure development, the functions of different ministries have been clubbed  together in the form of Pradhan Mantri Gatishakti National Master Plan.  In March 2014,  the total length of national highways in our country was 90 thousand kilometers whereas  today its length has been increased to more than one lakh forty thousand kilometers.  The  government is working with determination for the security of the country.  Due to the  policies of the government, the country\\'s self-reliance in the defence sector, especially in  defence production, is increasing continuously. I would like to thank you for  giving me the opportunity to speak on the Motion of Thanks on the President‟s Address.  Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav is a pious opportunity to give shape to the resolutions of next  twenty five years. This government is working on a fast pace for laying robust foundation  for the next twenty five years on the mantra of “Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas Aur Sabka  Prayas”. The effort of our country to tackle Corona pandemic is not merely limited to  immediate challenges. The Government is formulating such visionary solutions which  will be effective and useful in future also. India Health Infrastructure Mission started by  the Government with a cost of 64 thousand crore rupees is a significant example of the  same. More than 80 thousand health and wellness centres and Ayushman Bharat cards  issued in crores have immensely helped in giving treatment to the poor people. Free of  cost ration is being provided every month to all the poor under Pradhan Mantri Garib  Kalyan Ann Yojna. Pradhan Mantri Swanidhi Yojna is proving highly beneficial for our  street vendors. An amount of more than 29 hundred crore rupees have been released to 28  lakh street vendors under this scheme so far. The manner in which Jandhan-Aadhar- Mobile i.e J.A.M trinity has been linked by the Government for citizen empowerment, its  effect is being constantly witnessed. Crores of beneficiaries have received the benefit of  direct cash transfer during the pandemic due to linking of more than 44 crore poor  countrymen with banking system. This government considers the basic facilities a  medium of empowering the poor and raising their dignity. More than two crore pucca  houses have been allotted to poor under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna so far. Jal Jeevan  Mission started with the objective of making water available to each house has begun  bringing a big transformation in the lives of the people. About six crore rural houses have  been provided drinking water connection despite the hindrances of pandemic. In order to  provide remunerative price to the farmers for their crops, it is necessary to give access to  their produce to the appropriate market. For this purpose, the Government ran more than  1900 Kisan rail on more than 150 routes. It is an example of the saying that if the  thinking is new, new routes can be charted out with old resources. One lakh eighty  thousand crore rupees have been given to more than eleven crore farmer families through  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi. Big changes are being witnessed today in  agricultural sector with this investment. The infrastructure of the country is being made  robust by expanding the railway route and road route. The Presidential Address mentions that our nation has  made amazing progress during the last year.  The Government has been able to save  millions of lives through free COVID vaccination.  Our neighbouring countries like  Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and nations across the world have been provided  free Covid vaccines.  India‟s GPP is expected to be 8.3 per cent during 2021-22.  The  Government has introduced several welfare schemes for the benefit of the public. “ Make  in India‟, „Start-Up India‟, „Vocal for Local‟, „Atma-Nirbhar Bharat‟, Jan Dhan, Pradhan  Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission, e- Shram Portal are the names of some of the schemes.  In order to provide better healthcare  services to the people of the northern most districts of Bengal, namely, Darjeeling,  Kalimpong, Alipurduars, Jalpaiguri, Cooch Bihar, North Dinajpur and South Dinajpur, an  AIIMS should be established in North Bengal. A Medical College should also be  established in Kalimpong district.   This is the outline of renovation of India, which  makes clear that what kind of India we want in the period of Amrit Mahotsav of  independence.  The important resolution of this foundation is an all inclusive, benefitting  all, building an empowered India and self reliance of the country.  County has achieved  the record of more than 150 crore doses of anti corona vaccines in less than an year‟s  time, which includes single dose of vaccine to more than 90 percent adults and more than  70 percent people have taken both does.  The Government is approaching the remaining  people through “Har Ghar Dastak” campaign. This month onwards the teenagers of the  country from 15 to 18 years are included under the vaccination program. Pradhanmantri  Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission has been launched with cost of Rs. 64  thousand cores.  It is decided to continue the scheme of free ration distribution monthly  since last 19 months at a cost of Rs. 2 lakhs 60000 crores to 80 crore people of country  upto March 2022.  Under “Pradhanmantri Swanidhi Yojana” an amount of more than  2900 crores to 28 lakhs street vendors till now has been provided. More than 23 crore  labourers have connected with e-shram portal launched to protect their interests.  More  than 2 crore concrete Houses till now have been given to poor through “Pradhanmantri  Awas Yojana”, “Jal Jeevan Mission” with an aim to carry “Har Ghar Jal”, “Swamitra  Yojana” to give property document to people in rural areas is an extraordinary effort of  the Government.  One lakh 80000 crore rupees to more than 11 crore farmer families  through “Pradhanmantri Kisan Samman Nidhi” have been given.  In year 2021-22 the  help of 65000 crore rupees from banks to 28 lakhs self help-groups has been provided.   Many positive results of “Beti Bachao Beti Padhao” initiative are visible in the society.   This Government is continuously working with complete integrity and honest intent for  building a prosperous India. In the President‟s Address, it has been said that  India is the fastest growing economy in the world. All this has become possible due to the  policies of this government. In 2019, when the COVID-19 pandemic wave struck the  country, we had to import PPE kits required for doctors and corona warriors from China.  At the time, our Prime Minister had called on the people of entire country to make India  self -reliant. While we were importing PPE kits from abroad once, today we have  supplied Corona vaccines to 180 countries. In this way, this government has not only  saved the people of our country but also saved the people of different countries of the  world from COVID-19. Besides, our government has also saved the economy for the  country in these difficult times. Today, the growth rate of India has been projected at  9.6%. The capital expenditure has grown by 13.5% expenditure which has been used in  constructing highways, railways and international airports and also for providing  connectivity in the country. We have also made 8.6% expenditure in the social sector  which was 6.2% in the year 2014. In 1947 when our country became independent, 18,000  villages of our country were devoid of electricity. Our government has provided  electricity to these 18,000 villages. This government has provided electricity to 4.5 crore  households in the country under Saubhagya Yojna. Today, it is being said that we do not  believe in federal structure. There cannot be a greater example of following federal  structure than the fact that world‟s largest vaccine drive is going on in our country only.  There was a time when 2 crore people were not having houses in the country.  Our country is facing crisis due to the  Corona epidemic. The Government has worked very well towards protecting the citizens  of the country which is one of the world‟s countries that provided the maximum number  of free vaccination doses.  In health sector, various Government schemes have benefited  our people. During Corona period a number of people lost their jobs.  Our Government  has provided foodgrains to such needy and poor people. E-Shram Portal has been  launched for the workers, Jan-Dhan Aadhaar Mobile Service has been started, pucca  houses have been provided to about 2 crore families under PM Aawas Yojana and 6 crore  rural households were provided drinking water connections through „Har Ghar Jal‟  Yojana.  Amravati District was also benefited by this scheme for which I am highly  thankful.  Rs. 1 lakh 80 thousand crores have so far been paid to about more than 11 crore  farmer families through PM Kisan Samman Nidhi. Villages have been connected in the  entire country under PM Gram Sadak Yojana. 20 thousand kilometers of highway have  been constructed at the cost of about 6 lakh crore under Bharatmala project and 64 lakh  hectares of land is proposed to be irrigated by developing water harvesting infrastructure.  The Government has done a lot of work for the dignity of women. Today every woman  of the country is capable of standing up on her own and fight for herself.  Training is  being imparted in the tribal areas under Skill India Mission. And it has been announced in  the Budget also that after training, maximum people will get placement.  Airport in  Sindhudurg has been constructed and inaugurated. Likewise, Amravati will also have an  airport very soon.  Allocation of Rs. 300 crore for Railway Repair Factory is a big gift for  our Amravati, Vidarbha and Maharashtra. A tourism spot like Skywalk was held up in  Chikaldhara for a long time, but now work on it has started. An oxygen plant has also  been gifted to our district from PM Cares Fund.  I support the nation Motion of Thanks  on the President‟s Address. I express my gratitude to the Hon‟ble President and  second the Motion of Thanks moved by Shri Harish Dwivedi on President‟s Address.  Sir, new resolves are being taken for the next 25 years on the occasion of „AMRIT  MAHOTSAV‟ of Independence.  Covid vaccination programme in India showcases the  capability of India in fight against COVID-19.  More than 90 percent adults in the  country have taken single dose of Covid vaccine whereas more than 70 percent have  taken both the doses.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana has been started  with a cost of 64  thousand crores.  I come from Satna in Madhya Pradesh where 6 lakh 99 thousand 726  Ayushman Cards have been made.  This is indeed the Government of a true servant of  people.  Pucca houses have been built for more than 3 crore poor.  36,500 kilometer roads  have been built.  Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana has been introduced.  80 crore  persons were provided foodgrains free of cost under the largest distribution programme  of foodgrains.  More than 44 crore poor have been added in Jan-Dhan Account Scheme.   During Corona Pandemic, money was directly transferred into their accounts. Pradhan  Mantri Awas have been built for the poor including 37 lakh poor in Madhya Pradesh  including 1.5 lakh poor in Satna.  Farmer‟s loan was waived under UPA  Government but  that was only 65 thousand crore rupees and that too involved a scam of 25 thousand crore  rupees.  In Madhya Pradesh 83 lakh 45,152 farmers have got Kisan Samman Nidhi and in  Satna district alone 2 lakh 36,488 farmers have got  Samman Nidhi.  Mudra Bank  Yojana, Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao, increasing the age limit of marriage of girls to 21  years, making triple talaq illegal, the permission given to admission of girls in Sainik  Schools, recruitment of women in Police forces are all examples of empowerment of  women. Our government has brought a serious reform  through this Bill. Today we are making a provision to link Aadhaar with the voter list.  However, all political parties are opposing this Bill only due to vote bank politics. I  would also like to tell you that this amendment Bill has been brought by the government  to make provisions related to the polling booth premises. We support this Bill and urge  the House that no foreigner should be allowed to become a voter here. On behalf of my Biju Janata Dal Party, I  appreciate the way hon. Minister said that there will be four phases of qualification and it  will be gender neutral. At the same time, this is not the proper way to pass any Bill. It  should be discussed by all parties and then only considered to be passed. I support the Supplementary Demands for  Grants. The government made various arrangements to reduce the affect of corona virus  and it is commendable. Vaccines were manufactured in our country and these vaccines  were also sent abroad. Our government is setting up All India Medical Institutes in  different parts of the country. The government is going to increase the number of trains  and their speed. The work of beautification and cleanliness of railway stations is also  being done rapidly. Our government is making arrangements for making available clean  drinking water in every village. The government has distributed free ration to about 80  crore people under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana. It has provided many  facilities to students of the country by implementing the new education policy and it is  working to make the youth of the country self-reliant by implementing the skill  development scheme. Under the guidance of hon. PM, Shri Narendra  Modi, the thrust on the holistic development of our nation is escalating with a trajectory.  There is an increase of 8.6 per cent in expenditure over the Budget estimate. The Indian  economy is booming today. The foreign exchange reserves were at 304.2 billion USD in  2013-14 and now, we have reached the supreme number of 586.1 billion USD, and I am  cajoled that we will reach heights under the leadership of our hon. PM Shri, Narendra  Modi. The major thrust areas in the Supplementary Budget will be on four big- ticket  items such as fertiliser subsidies, pending export promotion incentives, expenditure  towards food storage and warehousing, and equity infusion into Air areas India Assets  Holding Ltd (AIAHL). More funds would be provided to the Ministry of Consumer  Affairs, Food and Public Distribution for meeting the expenditure towards various  schemes of food storage and warehousing. The increased Budget allocation would also  contribute to the GDP. The Government incurred an expenditure of nearly Rs.2.60 lakh  Crore in PMGKAY Phase l-V and the food grain under Phase V would entail an  estimated food subsidy of Rs. 53,344.52 Crore and the total outgo of food grains in Phase  V is expected to 163 LMT. Since 2013 14, the Budget for agriculture has increased by  more than six times, and similarly, the food production has increased to about 300 million  tonnes now from 251 million tonnes in 2015-16.  I rise to support the second batch of  Supplementary Demands for Grants for the year 2021-22. The Budget presented during  the pandemic has played a vital role in revival of economy. 8.4 per cent growth in the  second quarter, as has been pointed by the hon. Member itself explains whatever I have  been saying. Budget of 2021-22 embodies in itself three elements – hope, vigour and  confidence. The element of confidence, reflected by the Budget, is that the economy will  revive and reset. The Supplementary Demands for Grants reflects the spirit of the hon.  Prime Minister’s statement that this country is not made by politicians, kings and  Governments; this country is made by farmers, labourers, mothers, sisters and youths. We  must have the humility to accept it. Several opposition members have referred to  MNREGA. In this context, it is very important to understand the way the budget is  formulated. I would request the House not to compare apples with oranges particularly  when it comes to the biggest anti poverty programme of the world MGNREGS.  The  opposition is comparing the BE of 2021-22 with the RE of 2021. It is not fair.Under the  able guidance of our hon. Prime Minister, MGNREGS was transformed and focus was  given to asset creation. Today, I am delighted to tell you, that 60 lakh assets have been  created till date in this financial year and 256 crore person-days have been generated.  Moreover, there is a fund allocation of Rs. 25,000 crore and Rs. 2,000 crore have been  earmarked for asset creation.  During the Covid pandemic, a systematic health  care system has been put in place in the country under the leadership of Modi ji. The  programme of interlinking of rivers has been taken up on priority basis by the  Government. Under the leadership of Modi ji, teacher\\'s education has always accorded  due importance, for which a demand of Rs.300000 has been made. Lalitpur-Singrauli rail  line project needs to be completed at the earliest. I request the Union Government to  kindly allocate more funds to complete this project and also thank the Government for  allocating an amount of Rs. 2,00,00,00,00,000 to Railways. A demand of Rs.  1,92,73,90,00,000 has been made by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways for  village-to-village connectivity. Singrauli is facing the brunt of air pollution. A demand of  Rs 2,00,000 has been made by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. A provision of Rs.58,430 crore has been made  for providing subsidies on fertilizers to the farmers. If the Government had not helped the  farmers during Covid, the farmers of this country who are getting 50 kg of urea at the rate  of Rs. 360-365 would have got the same at the rate of Rs. 1700. If the Government had  not given subsidy on fertilizers,  a bag of DOP, which the Government is providing at  Rs.1200 that would have cost to the farmers around Rs.2900-3000. The hon’ble Prime  Minister is committed to double the income of farmers. National Rivers linking Project  has been formulated. Madhya Pradesh has been covered under the project and the sum of  Rs. 4,300 crore has been allocated by the Government initially. Ken-Betwa scheme has  been included as the first scheme under the project. Today, due to Covid-19, the  Government has decided to provide free ration to 80 crore people living under BPL  across the country by March, 2022. Our leaders from the Opposition side have termed  MGNREGA a dying scheme. But if MGNREGA had not been there, the poor labourers  would  not have got houses as they have got through the Prime Minister Awas Yojana.  Today, this Government has enhanced the Budget for the forces. One lakh twenty crore  rupees have been transferred to the farmer\\'s account through the Ministry of Agriculture  as Kisan Samman Nidhi under Direct Benefit Transfer. The Government has provided  loans to the new industries at very concessional rates. Farmers are a community in the  country. They are both producers as well as consumers. I urge upon the Government that  the farmer\\'s income should not be linked to inflation, because if the farmer\\'s produce is  expensive, the money is  going to the pockets of 65 per cent of the population of the  farmers. If anything tremendous has been  achieved of the level of  manufacturing Corona vaccine and saving the lives of the people  of the country while tackling the global pandemic, it has been done under the leadership  of hon. Prime Minister. I salute our successful Prime Minister and the Corona warriors  for the vaccination of more than 100 crore population at a record speed. The government  has set up 22 AIIMS in place of 6 AIIMS to provide healthcare facilities to the citizens  across the country. The decision of setting up a medical college in each parliamentary  constituency has been a historic in the medical field. The international Bharat Mala  Project of laying a network of roads and building several Expressways and highways in  all the four directions of the country and facilitating convenient road transport is a matter  of pride for the country. The government is committed to provide Rs. 6000 to the farmers  every year and doubling their income. Covering the poor retail shop keepers and small  businessmen under the pension scheme and motivating them to borrow loan of up to  rupees 10,000 from banks without any guarantor is a matter of pride for the country. The  government is also providing ration to 80 crore ration card holders in the wake of Corona  pandemic in the country. The government has also emancipated the country\\'s image  across the world by strongly advocating the stance of India on environment safety  measures before the world biggest powers in the Conference of Parties. The government  has also provided for budget allocation to expedite the river linking projects. The  government has also worked to increase the dignity of the country in the world. I rise to support the Narcotics Drugs And  Psychotropic Substance (Amendment) Bill, 2021. The way drug addiction is engulfing  the entire world, has seized the attention of all the countries the world over and the UNO  has also taken its cognizance. An International Narcotics Control Bureau has also been  set up to address this issue. Three global conventions have been held on this issue. The  entire world has taken a resolution to put an end to the existence of drugs on mother earth  showing solidarity. The Ministry of Social Empowerment has an important wing  committed to tackling drug addiction. On the 15th August last year anti addiction  campaign was launched in 272 districts across the country and the Department concerned  took the resolve to de-addict 100 districts of the country. The Government is making an  all out effort to ban the use of drugs except its sparing use in life saving drugs. The  consumption of drugs ruining the lives of the youth in Punjab is an issue of huge concern.  Some of the countries are involved in the smuggling of drugs which are also being reined  in by the Government of India. I support this Bill. The Government has tried  to focus on economy by supporting health, infrastructure and reforms. The  allocation for health has been increased. This is the relief to the industry that  no new tax has been levied. The farmers will get 1.5 times MSP of all  commodities. APMCs will be brought under Agri Infra Fund and 1000 more  mandis will be linked to e-NAM. Exemption on interest in relation to affordable  housing has been extended for another year. A provision of Rs. 1.1 lakh crore  has been made for the railways. 100 new Sainik schools will be established.  750 Eklavya residential schools will be established in tribal areas.   Scholarship scheme for the students of Scheduled Castes will be introduced.  Rs. 50,000 crore will be spent on National Research Foundation in order to  accelerate research in the country. Minimum wage code for all categories of  laborers will be implemented. Seven textile parks will be developed within  three years under Mega Investment Textile Park Scheme. GST procedure will  be simplified further. In the backdrop of Corona crisis, this Budget is very  special and it will make the country Atmanirbhar. I support the budget. Attempts have been  made to turn difficult times into opportunities to revive the country\\'s economy.  During the epidemic, the lockdown was announced and within 48 hours a  record package was announced to help the weaker sections of the society  and handle the economy. Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana and Ujjwala  Yojana have  benefited the poor and women. More than 40 crore farmers,  women, elderly, poor and needy were given cash directly in their accounts.  Adopting a comprehensive approach to enhance the budget of the health  sector, the Government has increased it  lump sum by 137 percent, which will  definitely help in improving the health facilities in the country. 64 thousand 180  crores will be spent in 6 years under Pradhan Mantri Atmanirbhar Bharat  Swasthya Yojana and a target of setting up critical care hospital blocks in 602  districts and 12 central institutions has been fixed. To provide clean water, a  target has been set to provide tap connections to 2 crore 86 lakh families of  urban bodies. The agriculture sector has been given priority in this budget.  There has been a hike in  the MSP. The Government is moving towards the  goal of doubling farmers\\' income. Under the Pradhan Mantri Swamitva  Yojana, one lakh 80 thousand villagers of 1241 villages of 6 states have been  given ownership of their houses. Through \\'One Nation, One Ration Card\\'  scheme, efforts were also made to ensure ration to the migrants living in  different states of the country. The Government has done commendable   work during the COVID pandemic by making  provision of free gas, food and  transfer of cash in accounts to the workers who reached their villages from  various cities. The budget provides for setting up of higher Education Council,  new Sainik Schools and Eklavya Vidyalaya for tribal community and  rejuvenation of 15,000 schools which are already running as Model schools.   Government has encouraged the farmers by increasing the price of cotton  and opening a number of centres for procurement. Cash assistance and  amount of agricultural insurance is being sent to farmers in Jan Dhan account.  This Budget provides for adequate funding for construction of railway line in  Vidarbha as well as in my parliamentary constituency. In my parliamentary  constituency, the long standing demand for setting up Ridhpur railway station  should be met at the earliest and a Sainik School should be opened in the  area.  I wholeheartedly congratulate the  Government and front-line warriors who have helped patients in facing  Corona situation in the last one year I also congratulate the Government for  making much progress and developing two Corona vaccines. To make further  progress, we need to reassess the doctor-patient ratio so as to suit the  present conditions prevailing in the country. The Government has announced  a proposal to set up four virology labs in the country. It is a welcome measure.  I request the Government to sanction a virology institute or lab in Hyderabad.  The capital of Telangana has been an industrial capital and a major economic  hub. Hyderabad is emerging as the pharma hub which is progressing in  Mucherla in Rangareddy district. I request the hon. Finance Minister to  allocate special funds or NIMZ status for pharma city. The Government of India has distributed  free ration to 80 crore people for eight months.  At the same time, the  Government of India has provided an economic package of Rs. 20 lakh crore  to revamp the industries.  The government has launched Garib Kalyan Rozgar  Yojana campaign in six states to provide jobs to the migrants who have  returned from cities due to the epidemic.  Five thousand crore rupees have  been provided under the PM\\'s Self Fund scheme for the street vendors and  hawkers. This Budget has benefited every section of the country.  It will bring  back our economy on track.  The provision of Rajasthan State Canal scheme  for Jaipur will benefit 13 districts.  It should be implemented at the earliest.   Similarly, the road of DMIC should be connected to Jaipur. This Budget is unique in itself because for  the first-time paperless Budget has been introduced. This budget will address  the loss caused to the economy of the country by the global Covid-19  pandemic and will take India to new heights in the world in the coming  decade. A provision of Rs. 2,23,846 crore has been made in the 2021-22  Budget for health and wellbeing which is an increase of 137 per cent as  compared to this year’s budgeted estimates. Under the Jal Jeevan Mission,  the of Har Ghar Nal Se Jal is progressing very quickly. A roadmap to move  towards complete sanitation in urban and rural areas has been prepared. To  tackle the problem of air pollution, an amount of Rs. 2,217 crores has been  allocated for 42 urban centres. The budgetary allocation for the Ministry of  Rural Development has been increased by Rs. 11,291 crore. Rashtriya Gram  Swaraj Abhiyan will be implemented with an outlay of Rs. 593 crores with the  primary aim of strengthening Panchayati Raj Institutions. Siddharthnagar  District in my constituency is the second-best performing district among  Aspirational District. Through this Budget I am sure that we can achieve a $5  Trillion economy with SABKA SAATH, SABKA VIKAS and SABKA VISHWAS. I would like to thank the hon. Prime  Minister and the hon. Finance Minister for presenting such a Budget that has  brought about tremendous progress in the development of Defence corridor,  Transport Nagar, 4 Lane Road from Aligarh to Haryana, NH-91, Road of  Muradabad and a bypass road in my Parliamentary Constituency. Moreover, I  would like to urge upon the Government to provide the stoppage of the  Hawarah Rajdhani at Aligarh which will help the people of my Constituency to  take their lock and key industry to a new height. Essential relief has been provided in the  Budget 2021-22 to fight with the conditions arising out of impact of pandemic  on our economy along with the poor sections of the society. Allocation of  2,23,846 crore rupees has been made for Health and Welfare  which is 137  per cent more than the last year. Government has made a provision of Rs.  35,000 crore for the vaccine of Covid-19. I request the Government to  announce a Medical College for Gopalganj so that people in my district will  not need to travel to metro cities.  Laying stress on the National Railway  Scheme, 2030,  an allocation of Rs. 1,10,055 crore has been made for the  Railways. There are no trains from Gopalganj to metro cities. Thawe junction  is an important junction in my Parliamentary Constituency which has  commercial feasibility also. Along with pit or pit line facility at Thawe junction,  facility of trains to metro cities should also be provided from here. Budget  2021-22 is not only the first Budget of this decade but also the first digital  Budget. This Budget shows the vision of \\'Atmanirbhar Bharat\\' along with trust  of 130 crore citizens of the country. The Government has made a lot of efforts to  tackle the Corona epidemic.  The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana was  announced within 48 hours of the lockdown being declared.  The self-reliant  India package was also a historic step taken by our Government.  This budget  was also a digital budget.  In fact, it is a historic paperless Budget.  In  addition, Pradhan Mantri Self-reliant Healthy India Scheme will be launched in  the field of health and welfare.  This Budget provides for making urban India  more clean.  At the same time, a provision of Rs. 35, 000 crore has been  made in the Budget for Corona vaccination.  I request that adequate budget  should be provided for Lalitpur-Singrauli railway project in my parliamentary  constituency.  The Rural Infrastructure Development Fund has also been  increased by our Government.  I thank the Government for presenting the  friendly Budget this year. Today, the people of our nation are  becoming independent.  For the last one year, the entire world alongwith our  country was facing the Corona pandemic but today we have come out of it  with new capabilities as compared to other countries of the world.  During the  last one year, our Prime Minister took the most accurate decisions and  announced record economic packages. For 8 months the Government  provided 5 kgs of additional foodgrain per month to 80 crore poor people   under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana and it also expressed its  concern towards the people living miles away from their homes by providing  them foodgrain under the „One National One Ration Card‟  system. The  Government developed COVID vaccine in India itself and has proved to be a  life savior by sending this COVID vaccine to many countries across the world  including our own neighbouring countries which is a great example of self- reliant India.      Apart from developing its research capabilities, scientific and technical  excellence India has also developed a network of laboratories, manufactured  PPE kits, test kits and, ventilators which has made India a self-reliant nation  and we are being praised across the world for this.  In the field of health  sector also, the Government has done unprecedented work in the last 6  years.  It has provided facility of free medical treatment of upto Rs.5 lakh to  crores of poor families under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.  22 new  AIIMS have been set up in the country.  Small and marginal farmers have  been given Kisan Samman Nidhi, lakhs of villages have been connected with  optical fiber, small and cottage industries have been developed, water taps at  every household have been provided under the Jal Jeeevan Mission and  many more of such unprecedented achievements have been made during the  last six years in all the sectors including defence and space.  India is also  getting global support and co-operation today which has helped it secure a  place in the UN Security Council for the eighth time and our country is  heading the BRICS Organisation also. The Prime Minister has provided electricity  to every household of the country under the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya  Yojana so that the children of the poor can also study well under electric light.  Under the Ujjwala Yojana, free gas connections were given to more than eight  crore women.

Our government has  connected one thousand mandis with the e-market. Our Government has  made a provision of 100 Sainik  schools by making a new education policy. I  would like to highlight the achievement of India in terms of Defence. We also  do air strikes and surgical strikes. At the time of Corona,  there was chaos in  the whole country. Everyone was worried about what would happen to India,  as it has a population of 130 crore. India is the country which has taken the  lead in making a vaccine and providing it to the world. Our country is often  used to demand for things. Today you have seen that the world is asking us to  provide a vaccine. People from 90 countries have asked us to provide them  the vaccine of Covid. We have given Covid vaccine to all the friendly countries  free of cost. No country can ignore the significance of India. I demand from  my Government that a SEZ zone be set up in Purvanchal. That zone should  be tax free so that industries and businesses may get a boost and  employment is created. My Constituency Basti, is adjoining Ayodhya. Holy  river Manohar flows along with sacred  Makhoda Dham. The river  Manohar  should be cleaned and developed by the Department of  Water  Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation under the Ministry of  Jal Shakti. The appropriate decisions taken by the  Government has saved the lives of lakhs of our countrymen.  Under the  leadership of Shri Narendra Modi ji we have successfully faced the challenges  of corona virus pandemic. Now while catering to the domestic need of corona  vaccine we are supplying it to other countries also.  Opposing farm reforms  bills is totally inappropriate.  These farm reforms will definitely help to double  the farmers‟ income.  There should be a check on the misinformation being  spread through social media.  The Government has also introduced new  education policy keeping in view the global needs of 21st century.  The major  part of my Parliamentary Constituency is tribal dominated area.  Setting up of  Eklavay Vidyalayas will provide educational facilities to the local people.  29  labour laws have been amalgamated in 4 labour codes.  These reforms will  definitely transform the lives of labourers.  Steps have also been taken to  provide self-employment opportunities for women.  The President‟s Address  has included all the major issues be it is the internal security of the country,  foreign policy, basic facilities, infrastructure or building a new India through  Digital India Yojana. This budget is unprecedented  because in this budget the huge financial provisions have been made to save  the country from Corona pandemic by increasing the employment  opportunities indirectly.  The Government has paid special attention towards  agriculture and farmers.  Prices of crops has been fixed 1.5 times of the  Minimum Support Price (MSP).  A budget of Rs. 15,700 crore has been  provided to small and medium enterprises (MSME).  MSME sector will  definitely benefitted by technical and financial facilities provided by the  Government. Our Government has not compromised with Defence budget.  Even during Corona crisis.  Hon‟ble Finance Minister has helped in taking the  goal of „Aatmnirbhar Bharat‟ to a new dimension.  A comprehensive approach  can be seen in this Budget for making the country self-reliant.  Hon\\'ble  Finance Minister has made extensive improvement in health sector and  increased the health budget by 137%. Education sector has been promoted in  the budget and emphasis has been given on implementation of new education  policy, skill development, research and innovation.  This Budget gives thrust  to strengthen the agricultural sector of the country, and to boost the income of  farmers.  For further strengthening of APMC, provision of assistance from  Agriculture Infrastructure Fund has been made. This budget is completely up  to the expectations of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas. Last year will be  remembered as time of the pandemic as well as how skillfully  the  government, led by Hon\\'ble Shri Narendra Bhai Modiji,  managed it. The  government has succeeded in preventing the widespread anarchy in the  country with its Pradhan Mantri Grarib Kalyan Yojana and PM Garib Kalyan  Rojgar Yojana. The government has strengthen the health sector with the  establishment of 22 new AIIMs. The government has a plan to invest Rs. 20  thousand crore in  animal husbandry and fisheries  in next five years. The  government, led by Modi Ji, have open new development opportunities for  women. Nearly 70% of the total Mudra loan has been given to women. A  major step has been taken for making India self-reliant with the  announcement of new education policy to face the challenges of coming  decades. The government led by Modi Ji  tackled the corona pandemic efficiently. Under Prime Minister Narendra  Modi\\'s leadership, the government fought with the coronavirus pandemic  effectively. Free food grains were given to  migrant labourers  and Shramik  Special trains were also run. Millions of vaccine doses have been given to  many countries. The government has implemented the recommendation of  the Swaminathan Commission and is giving MSP 1.5 times of crop  production. The visionary government has taken care of small and marginal  farmers and the facilities of better techniques, more credit, post harvest  processing and marketing facilities are being provided to them.

An Animal Husbandry  Infrastructure  Development Fund with Rs. 15,000 crore has been set up to  promote infrastructure and investment in dairy development. The work of  Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana has been sped up to provide a pucca house for  all the poor by 2022.

The construction of 06 new Expressways and  18 new Access Control Corridor is going on in Phase I of the Bharatmala  project. Hon. President has  emphasized on making India completely self-reliant. India has seized the  opportunity in disaster  and has moved ahead on its own path of self-reliance.  India has also demonstrated its scientific ability and technical skills by  manufacturing thousands of ventilators, in a very short time and becoming self  reliant in manufacturing PPE kits to test kits. India is making both vaccines in  its own country for vaccination campaign. Along with this, India is also  providing vaccines to other countries also. As regards, Agriculture Hon.  President mentioned about extensive reforms in irrigation, facility of micro- irrigation, increase in production of foodgrain in the country, benefits to small  farmers and Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. Health services in the  country are also expanding very fast. The Parliament passed three important  Bills, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and  Facilitation)Bill,  the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection ) Agreement on  Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, and the Essential Commodities  Amendment Bill seven months ago. More than 10 crore farmers have started  getting the maximum benefits of these agricultural reforms. Kisan Rail has  been started across the country. The pace of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana  has also been accelerated to provide pucca houses to every poor by the year  2022.

Under the Pradhan Mantri  Kusum Yojana, 20 lakh solar pumps are being given to the farmers.  Production of ethanol from molasses, maize, paddy etc. is also being  encouraged. The medical fraternity, the frontline workers  were at the forefront for fighting the greatest struggle of COVID-19 in the  history of mankind.  I extend my special thanks to the scientists, doctors,  nurses and other paramedical staff members for injecting hope and self-belief  among masses of India.  Hon. President has delivered an historic Address  while the country is overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic.  It has set India on  the idea of self-reliance of the country, which our freedom fighters had  envisioned, the dream of an empowered and free India.  The country has  witnessed an unparalleled and indomitable courage, sprit, endurance and  discipline of our countrymen.  Hon President has reiterated to come together  over the last year to overcome multiple challenges and adversities, including  COVID-19 pandemic, floods in various parts of the country, earthquakes,  cyclones, locust attack and bird-flu.  We have come a long way since the  onset of the pandemic, from being a net importer of PPE kits to becoming a  net exporter.  India‟s vaccine manufacturing capability is a global asset.   United Nations as well Committee on Health and Family Welfare has lauded  the efforts of the Government in handling the pandemic situation. We have  truly abided by India‟s greatest slogan, „Vasudhaiva Kudumbakan‟ (the world  is one family), by supplying vaccines to so many countries.  India has  undertaken the world‟s largest vaccination drive with an ambition to vaccinate  30 crore people in the next few months.  Starting from providing Shramik  special trains for the migrant labourers to providing „One Nation One Ration  card‟, to make food grains available to all are some affirmative steps under  taken during pandemic.  The various initiatives of the Government coupled  with the package of „Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan‟ has made sure that the  Government is focused on enhancing vibrant markets for providing multiple  job opportunities and facilitating development.  There has been a political will  to bring reforms in sectors such as agriculture and health.  India‟s budget for  the defence sector in 2021-22 is Rs. 4,78,195 crore, whereas the same in the  year 2014-15 during the Congress era was RS 2,29,000 crore.  Hon.  President, during his speech, has elaborately explained the achievements of  the Government in the field of healthcare also. The Government has made  arrangements to provide free of cost food to poor under Garib Kalyan Yojana  during the Corona pandemic and the most important task was performed by  the department of Health and Family Welfare in which all the hospitals and  dispensaries, be it doctors or nurses, lab technicians or the persons involved  in preparing masks worked to their full capacity in urban as well as rural  areas.  Our scientists with their untiring efforts developed the Corona vaccine  in a short time which is not only being supplied within the country but to many  other countries of the world.  Besides this the Government is emphasising to  provide employment to migrant labourers in their villages itself and to promote  self reliance by providing economic assistance to poor women and senior  citizens. The Government has operated Kisan rails and other sources such as  animal husbandry and fisheries were added to increase their income.  For  providing clean drinking water to each household under Jal Jeevan Mission  and to make people self reliant the Government is running many schemes.  The Government is working on many aspects such as implementation of New  Education Policy, promoting latest technology and digital banking,  construction of new Sansad Bhavan, increasing facilities for Parliamentarians,  new reforms for labourers, merger of banks, setting up companies, laying new  railway lines, houses for the urban poor and starting Metro trains in 27 Cities  etc. Today, India is the part of top five  economies.  I would like to thank our Finance Minister as at a time when the  entire world had the impression that Indian economy shall be doomed, the  budget talks of double digit economy in the time to come.  Alongside, I would  also like to thank the Prime Minister who has persuaded the mass to focus on  both life and livelihood amidst critical time.  When life would be saved, it would  obviously be followed by livelihood measures.  The budget has taken due  care of children, elderly people and women.  This budget has provided many  good things wherein the senior citizens will not be subjected to paying taxes  from now on.  Unless and until there is infrastructure development in the rural  areas, betterment of agriculture markets, compensation to farmers and efforts  aimed at ensuring sanitation and hygiene, one just cannot expect the  empowerment of women and substantial reduction in the MMR or child  mortality rate.  As many as 40 crore bank accounts were opened in the year  2014 with a view to facilitate the benefits to be delivered through the agency  of financial institutions.  As a matter of fact, the Government is committed to  the welfare of the poor, farmers, labourers and the destitute folk which has  been reflected in the budget.  This budget intends to provide all those people  with an opportunity who wish to transform Indian condition and its economy.     When other manufactures are free to sell their produce in any market then  why this option should not be given to the farmers? Even the stock market  has responded well to the Budget. Budget allocation to all sectors including  drinking water and sanitation has been increased. A lot of work has been  done in the health sector. However, Delhi and Bengal have not implemented  the Ayushman Bharat Scheme. These laws allow no room to anyone to usurp  the land of farmers. The parties and the leaders opposing these laws have  been promising the same earlier. Local manufacturing has been given  impetus. Adequate Budget allocation has been made to the Railways for  various projects. Capital expenditure in defence has been increased. The  country has moved from the \\'fragile five\\' to the top five economies. With  everybody\\'s  participation, our economy  is all set to become a 10 trillion dollar  economy. It is not only a popular budget but also a budget  which ensures all round development of the country and it takes us on the  path of self-reliance .While economy of the entire world was crippled during  the corona pandemic, India remained the only country of the world which was  able to bring its economy back on the track and also provided corona vaccine  to the world to fight against the disease in these difficult times .India Vision  2020 visualized by Dr. Kalam has been materialized in the year 2020 in actual  sense. This Government turned the crisis in to an opportunity for the  development of our country under the leadership of our Hon. Prime Minister.  As a result, new aircrafts like Tejas were inducted into our Army. In this  budget, all sections of the society have been taken care of and efforts have  been made to extend benefits of the govt. schemes to the needy persons. Be  it Eklavya Vidyalaya or Ujjwala Yojana or expansion of the Indian Railways or  expansion of the National Highways, on all the fronts the government has  proved that by taking all together, we can ensure the development of all. The  Union Government has announced to set up New 69 New Eklavya Vidyalayas  in Jharkhand. This step would definitely help the children of the tribal families  to realize their dreams. By allocating Rs. 35 thousand crore for corona  vaccine, the Government has made it clear that it is very much concerned  about the healthcare  of the general public and is committed towards ensuring  the safety of its citizens from worldwide corona virus pandemic. Long term  projects proposed for the growth of railways in the budget would undoubtedly  accelerate the pace of development of the county. Setting up of seven new  textile parks in the country would give us worldwide recognition in the field of  textiles. So, we can say that this budget has taken care of all the sections of  the society. The Budget of 2021-22 is budget for  village, poor, farmers, women, youth, elders and traders. I extends my  heartiest congratulation to Hon‟ble Finance Minister for presenting the  paperless budget for the first time in the history of India. This Budget is digital  budget. A number of significant steps has been taken during destructive  Corona pandemic. The largest vaccination campaign of the world has been  rapidly started in the country. Decisive victory of India in the war against  Covid-19 is expected. The Government has increased the health budget by  137 per cent as compared to previous year to strengthen health infrastructure  which is unprecedented. The Government has proposed to introduce  „Pradhamantri Aathmnibhar Swasth Bharat Scheme‟ with Rs. 64180 crore  under health budget in the budget. Aatmnibhar package of Rs. 20 lakh crore  was announced to improve the economy of the country affected due to  Corona Pandemic which has been increased to Rs. 24 lakh crore. Funds has  been released to promote MSME sector during this period. While extending  Ujjawal Yojana, a proposal to add one crore women beneficiary to this  scheme is proposed. A provision of Rs. 1000 crore made for the women tea  workers of Assam and Bengal and their children. The Government is  dedicated and committed towards giving priority to agriculture reforms and  farmers‟, the Government has made provision to increase MSP by 1.5 times  of farmers‟ produce. Provision has been made to connect 1000 Mandis to  national e-bazaar. The scope of operation Green Yojana value addition in  agriculture and related produce and their export. Thirteen lakh twenty seven  thousand farmers have subscribed for crop insurance and paid more than Rs.  812 crore as premium in Haryana under Pradhamantri Fasal Beema Yojana.  Haryana is the only State are done at MSP than which procure highest  quantity of agricultural produce of MSP than any other State.  Three  agriculture laws have been enacted during Corona period. Procurement at  MSP has also increased after the enactment of these laws. To strengthen the  economy of the country, Government has proposed the investment of Rs.  20000 crore in Public Sector Banks, increasing the FDI threshold by 74 per  cent and to simplify the process of Startup in 2021-22 Budget. Provision of  making public transport more accessible to people has been made in the  budget. This budget is very balanced and budget of public interest. This Budget makes the highest allocation for  infrastructure development and capital asset creation.  By virtue of the Indian  model of handling COVID-19, the lowest fatality rate of 1.4 per cent in the  country has been possible.  India is one of the few countries that have  indigenously developed and manufactured COVID-19 vaccine.  We have  distributed and supplied vaccines to 15 countries. The Government has  positively transformed every aspect of India‟s life.  This is the most reformist  Government in the history of India.  FDI in Defence, FDI in insurance, GST  are the biggest reforms of Independent India. India has improved in its Ease  of Doing Business ranking by 79 positions.  India is no longer the country  having the greatest number of poor people.  We issued 22.41 crore soil health  cards to our farmers.  We built 10.75 crore toilets for the poor.  We ensured  100 per cent electrification of India‟s villages. We opened bank accounts of  41.75 crore poorest of the poor Indians through the PM Jan Dhan Yojana.   We have sanctioned 2.11 lakh kilometers of road connectivity for villages  under the Prime Minister Gram Sadak Yojana since 2014.  We gave  assistance of Rs. 6,000 crore to 11.58 crore farmers under the PM Kisan  Samman Nidhi.  We gave insurance under the Fasal Bima Yojana to 8.85  crore farmers of this country.  The Budget focuses on agricultural  infrastructure.  The Government has built one-third of all National Highways in  India in just the last six years. By 2024, all of Indian Railways will be 100 per  cent electrified, leading to fuel savings of about Rs. 14,500 crore per annum.   I thank the Finance Minister for sanctioning Rs. 15,000 crore to Bengaluru  Metro Airport Line.  The Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme brings together 318  schemes of the Government from 53 ministries. We have also saved close to  Rs. 1.78 lakh crore by preventing leakages.  Rs. 1,500 crore has been  earmarked in this Budget for further encouraging digital payments.  The  National Language Translation Mission will make governance and policy  related knowledge available on the internet in major Indian languages.   SWAMITVA Project aims at digitizing rural land records. Abolishing and  resolving the issue of angel tax, enabling direct listing of Indian companies on  Foreign Exchange have supported Indian start-ups. The National Research  Foundation has been allocated Rs. 50,000 crore.  We have taken the  leadership in the world today by starting International Solar Alliance. The  Budget also promises a Hydrogen Mission. It is good for the country‟s energy  security.  One Nation-One Ration Card or the amendments made to the  Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation Act show that the  Government is more sensitive and caring.  Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana  and my State, Karnataka have got the highest allocation of budget compared  to any of the previous budgets.  I welcome the innovative  works which are shown in this year‟s Budget. I would like to draw the attention  of our Water Resources Minister towards the fact that CW Research centre is  located at Pune. If you grant sufficient funds for further development and  research at this institute, it would be beneficial for the drinking water projects  in our country. Pune is an emerging and fast expanding city. A Metro project  is underway, kindly make further necessary provision to support this Pune  Metro Rail Project. I thank Hon. Railway Minister Shri Piyush Goyal ji for  sanctioning all the rail connectivity projects whether it is airport line extension  or other rail projects in Pune. During this Corona pandemic, Central  Government has sanctioned Rs. 6310 crore for my State Maharashtra.  Through the development of more infrastructure projects, this Government is  focusing on employment generation. The Government is providing loans and  aids to jobless youth to start small businesses. This Government is focusing  on the empowerment of women through various welfare schemes regarding  education and research. In this budget, Rs. 38,000 crore has been sanctioned  for the welfare of tribals. Hon. Modi ji has announced the Nal Se Jal scheme  to ensure the supply of drinking water to every household. Atmanirbhar Bharat Budget is a confident,  bold, ambitious and self-reliant budget of a transformed India. I congratulate  the Finance Minister for presenting a dynamic and visionary budget. For the  first time in the history of India, the budgetary allocation for public health  spending has been proposed to be increased by 137 percent. This was very  much needed. India‟s frontline health workers need to be praised and  adequately compensated. In this budget, additional revenue of 30000 crore  rupees will be collected by cess on petrol, diesel, which will go only in the  interest of farmers. The budget of Ministry of Women and Child Development  has been raised by16. 31 percent which has never happened before. The  government has not only worked to bring the derailed economy back on track  due to the Covid crisis, but now the economy is running at a fast pace. GST\\'s  record collection is proof of this. India has developed in the last six and a half  years so much which was never seen during the 6 to 7 decades since  independence. India is becoming more powerful today and the value of  Indians is increasing in the whole world. Budget 2021-22 will fully strengthen the self- sufficient India emerging on the global stage in the new decade.  In this  budget, all including villagers, poor people, farmers, women, youths, old  people and businessmen have been taken care of. Budget 2021-22 presented  now is of 34.83 lakh crores which is double the budget for the year 2013-14.  How this budget could made possible without any developmental works?  Earlier, there were 3.31 crores taxpayers in the country. Today, this number  has reached up to six crores and fifty lakhs. This is the biggest example of  growing economy. The decision to set up \\'Bad Banks\\' to strengthen the  banking sector mentioned in the budget is a commendable step. The  industries that couldn\\'t operate at the time of lockdown whether it is heavy  industries, MSME industries, street vendors and others were given liquidity.  The budget made elaborate arrangements for the development of basic  infrastructure, Swasth Bharat Mission, Jal-Jeevan Mission, agricultural  reforms and farmer welfare, security of the country and new education policy.  After the recommendation of 15th finance commission, States will get 41.8  percent share from central taxes. The outcome of the 20 lakh crore economic  package given for \\'Atma nirbhar Bharat\\' during the Corona period is being  visible now. P.L.I scheme has been made to cover 13 sectors to make  manufacturing global champions. For this, a provision of 1.92 lakh crores has  been made. Target has been fixed to set up critical care hospital blocks in 602  districts and 12 central institutions in the country. During the last six years, the  Government has set up 175 new medical colleges and 22 new AIIMS  hospitals. Through Ayushman Bharat Yojana, more than one and a half crores  of poor people got free treatment. 3600 crores worth medicines have been  provided to poor people at cheap price through Jan-Aushadhi Kendras. The  second focus of budget is given to agricultural reforms and farmer\\'s welfare.  Ten thousand FPOs are being constituted. This will be important especially for  poor farmers. The benefit of three important agriculture amendment laws is  going to be received immediately by more than ten crores small farmers in the  country. Based on the recommendation of Swaminathan Committee, MSP  has been kept at more than one and a half times of the cost of production.  The budget for Micro irrigation scheme has been doubled from its earlier  budget of 5,000 crores. Earlier, there were only three items in operation green  – tomato, onion and potato, now, 22 green vegetables have been included in  this. This is remarkable. I request to set up a green park in the Maihar area of  my Parliamentary Constituency, Satna. The Government has implemented  Swamitva Yojana benefitting crores of people so far. During the Corona  period, 80 crores people have been given 5 kg food grains for eight months  free of cost. 2 lakh crores has been directly transferred through Jan-Dhan,  Aadhar and mobile. 14 crores free gas cylinders have been distributed. 8  crore women were given free cooking gas. Hon.Finance Minister has  announced to provide 1 crore new gas connections through Ujjwala Yojana. 2  crores poor people were provided houses. 10 crores toilets have been built  protecting the honor of sisters and daughters. \\'Har Ghar Jal\\' is a big scheme  for which a provision of 2.87 lakh crore has been made. The length of national  highways has increased from 51,287 km to 1,36,155 kms. N.H.74 in my  Parliamentary Constituency connects Naugaon, Bamitha,  Khajuraho, Satna  and Sidhi. Please complete the unfinished work in this route. The D.P.R of  Ayodhya-Chitrakoot national highway is ready. Please sanction it. Kindly  provide budget provision for the national highway sanctioned from Satna to  Simariya via Allahabad. Lord Rama stayed at Chitrakoot for 11 years. Please  set up a museum there. I request to set up a Sainik School in Satna  Parliamentary Constituency now among the 100 new Sainik schools that are  going to be set up in the country. In the year 2014, the Hon. Prime Minister  had said that this is a Government dedicated to the poor and therefore, the  Government had started Jan Dhan accounts in the country. The Opposition  ruled for the 70 years but the poor were not able to enter the banks. In the  initial stages of Corona pandemic, there were no PPE kits, no ventilators in  the country but this Government enabled the people to fight Corona virus by  getting ventilators and PPE kits manufactured just within two months.  Rs.500  each were credited to the accounts of poor people during that time to support  their livelihood. All should remain happy, all should remain healthy – this is the  culture of India. Our hon. Prime Minister considers the entire world as one  family. And that is why the Government is sending vaccine to a number of  countries in the world and has not kept it only limited for India. Some people  have lost their political ground and they are left with nothing. These are the  people who are now lamenting in the name of farmers. I would like to ask the  Congress party that if they were so concerned about the poor farmers then  what happened to the Swaminathan Commission‟s report? What happened to  its recommendations? Since the BJP Government came into power under the  leadership of hon. Modiji, this legislation has been enacted after accepting  201 recommendations of the same Swaminathan Commission so that the  farmers‟ income is doubled. First of all „Fasal Bima Yojana‟ was brought under  which farmers were assured of crop insurance on payment of just 2 or 1.5 per  cent premium. The MSP of wheat was Rs. 1400 per quintal in 2013-14 which  was raised to Rs. 1975 per quintal in 2020-21. Similarly, MSP of paddy was  increased to Rs. 1868 from Rs. 1310 per quintal which is an increase of 43  per cent. The Government has set a target of providing 20 lakh solar pumps  under the Pradhan Mantri Kusum Yojana in which the farmers have to pay  only 10 per cent. The previous Government had procured 3.7 lakh metric  tonnes of oil seeds while our Government has procured 56 lakh metric tonnes   of oil seeds. Our government has succeeded in saving the lives of  crores of people under the visionary leadership and efficacy of our Prime  Minister. Presently, we are capable of manufacturing PPE kit, N-95 mask and  ventilators and all other essential items. Today, India has emerged as a big hope  for the world in case of vaccine manufacturing and its supply.  Despite Covid, our  country registered a 13% increase in FDI sector in the year 2020. Our  government has done many commendable works for the welfare of the poor  during Corona period. Government medical facilities are in a very pitiable  condition in the whole of Bengal particularly North Bengal. Therefore, I would like  to request the Union Government to construct an AIIMS hospital or a hospital on  the lines of AIIMS in my constituency.  Darjeeling and Kalimpong district  hospitals should also be upgraded to medical colleges.  A permanent political  solution should be provided to the long pending demand of the people of  Darjeeling hills, Tarai and Doaars region for a state of Gorkhaland. In these times of worldwide Coronavirus  pandemic, it was extremely important that all of us unitedly fight against this  menace and get rid of it ,and under the leadership of Modi ji and with the  cooperation of each and every citizen of the country ,today we are in a situation  to beat this deadly pandemic. Under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana,  5Kg additional food grains per month were provided free of cost to 80 crore  people for eight months. The migrant workers were provided One Nation One  Ration Cards (ONORC) along with free food grains and Shramik Special Trains  were run for facilitating them.14 crore cooking gas connections were provided to  the beneficiaries under Ujjawala Yojana during this pandemic. This Government  has taken several historical decisions such as providing free treatment through a  health cover upto 5lakh rupees under Ayushman Yojana, making medicines  available at extremely affordable rates to the people under Janaushadhi  Yojna  and sanctioning 22 AIIMS  under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana  .In  his address ,the Hon. President has stressed on Atam Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan   which is a revolutionary step towards empowering the nation. Under this  Abhiyan, the Government has made all efforts right from providing seeds to  making markets accessible to the framers during the last six years. Now, a  comprehensive improvement is being seen in the available irrigation facilities.  Under Per Drop More Crop scheme, the Government is not only completing old  irrigation projects but also making modern irrigation technologies available to the  farmers. Today, there is a record availability of food grains in the country. So far,  1 lakh and 13 thousand crore rupees have been transferred to the accounts of  the farmers under PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi Scheme. Besides, Fasal Bima  Yojana has also proved to be extremely beneficial for the farmers. 10,000  Farmers Produce Organizations have been set up for facilitating the small  farmers, which is an effective step under the Atam Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan. The  Government is paying special attention to modern ago infrastructure with a view  to make farming more profitable. For this purpose, an infrastructure fund worth  one lakh crore rupees has been instituted. Today, a large number of self- employment opportunities are being provided to women. Today, Deendayal  Antyodaya  Yojana –  National Rural  Livelihoods  Mission (DAY-NRLM) has  facilitated creation of 66 Self Help Groups covering more than 7 crore women  entrepreneurs in the country.  Keeping in view the health care of working women  in rural areas, the Government has started a scheme called „Suvidha‟ to provide  sanitary napkins at the cost of Rs. 1 to the women. The Government has also  ensured that pregnant women get free health check-ups and there is a Rashtriya  Poshan Abhiyan for their overall health. In his Address Hon. President  regretted violence and disrespect to tricolor on the Republic Day saying right to  freedom of expression goes hand in hand with the constitutional duty to follow  the rule of law.  I fully endorse this statement of him.  As we all are very much  aware that the impact of COVID-19 pandemic is unimaginable, under such  circumstances, the hon. President has shown the right directions to the progress  of the country and put spotlight on India‟s self-confidence.  Through the  President‟s Address the Union Government sent a significant message to the  people of the country by mentioning that it would respect the Supreme Court‟s  decision to suspend three farm reform laws and claimed that the laws have given  new rights to the farmers.  In his Address, the hon. President talked about the  Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana.  80 crore people were provided an  additional five Kg. free food grains per month for eight months.  The  implementation of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana is to ensure a pucca roof for  every poor person by 2022.  The Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyan aims to provide  employment to the returnee migrant labourers in their villages.  There are other  achievements like encouraging street vendors and hawkers under SVANidhi  scheme, providing financial support to poor women to the tune of Rs. 31,000  crore which was directly transferred to the Jan Dhan accounts, distribution of  more than 14 crore gas cylinders to poor women beneficiaries free of cost under  the Ujjwala scheme.  Regarding the development of the rural infrastructure, there  is a need for more and more roads and bridges in the villages.  If we want to  achieve the aim of self-reliant Adarsh Gram as dreamt by pujya Bapu Ji, this  should be our priority.  There is a mention about the Suvidha Scheme under  which sanitary napkins are made available at a nominal cost of Rs. 1.  Under the  National Education Policy for the first time, students have been given the  freedom to opt for the subjects of their choice under the policy.  The Government  should accord priority to save the Indian languages by teaching to students at the  primary level. I would like to support the address  of the Hon. President. India bravely faced the dangerous and fatal disease like  corona virus in the year 2020. Corona Virus is a global pandemic. It has affected  almost all the major countries across the world. Free food grains were made  available for 80 crore people under the Pradhan Mantri Gharib Kalyan Yojana.  Slogan of \\'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas aur Sab ka Vishwas\\' was fully  implemented  during the corona period. Government had opened the Jan Dhan Accounts of  people earlier and people received its benefits  when the Govt. Infused money in  their accounts during the Corona  period. Now,  vaccine has been developed to  tackle the pandemic and all the people are being vaccinated free of cost.  Besides, we are also supplying the vaccine to our friend countries. The work  being done by the Narendra Bhai Modi government during the last six years is  itself historic. 175 medical colleges were opened in 6 years in which 50000 seats  were increased. In addition to this we have achieved expected success in the  works related to national highways and railway lines during the last six years. Our country is a developing country.  We have limited health care facilities in comparison to the developed  countries. But despite this we judiciously dealt with this pandemic and  emerged victorious. Today India has gifted corona vaccine to its neighbours  and other countries free of cost. Developed countries like Brazil has  expressed its faith in the corona vaccine developed in India instead of vaccine  developed by Pfizer and Moderana. This pandemic disrupted the economy of  the world and our country. Lakhs of people were rendered jobless. Hon‟ble  Prime Minister showed his acumen. Record economic package was  announced to take care of the economy. Free ration was distributed among  small workers for 8 months.  China betrayed us but our armed forces gave  them a befitting reply. State of the art defence equipments have been  provided to our Armies. The emphasis of our government is on Atmanirbhar  Bharat. Several steps have been taken in this regard.  We are heading  towards export in defence sector. Implementing the recommendations of the  Swaminanthan Committee the government has decided to provide MSP equal  to one and half times of the cost. In the year 2013-14, micro irrigation facility  was available for 42 lakh hectare of land but at present 56 lakh hectare  additional land is brought under micro irrigation.  The production of food grain  was 234 million tonne in the country in 2008-09 but it increased to 296 million  tonne in the year 2019-20.  Production of vegetable and fruits increased from  217 million tonne to 320 million tonne during the same period.  A special  SVANidhi Scheme has been launced for street vendors. Our government has  carried out various reforms in the field of education.  Out of the total farmers in  the country 80 per cent are small farmers and their number is more than 10  crore.  More than one lakh thirteen crore rupees have been transferred into  the bank accounts of such farmers under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi. 10  thousand Farmer Producer Organisations have been set up. The Parliament  has passed three agricultural law 7 months ago. More than 10 crore small  farmers have started getting the benefits of these farm reforms.

The  Government has set up Animal Husbandary Infrastructure Development Fund  of Rs. 15 thousand crore. Farmers have been provided 20 lakh solar pumps  under Pradhan Mantri Kusum Yojana. The Government has connected more  than 3 crore households with piped water supply under Jal Jivan Mission.  Under MUDRA Scheme loans to the tune of more than Rs. 25 crore have  been disbursed out of which 70 per cent loans have been provided to the  women entrepreneurs. Today more than 7 crore women entrepreneurs are  associated with 66 lakh self-help groups in the country under National Rural  Livelihood Mission. Under National Education Policy students are allowed to  study as per their interest.  Today more than 3 crore 20 lakh students are  getting the benefits of scholarship. The expansion of Eklavya Residential  Model School is being carried out. More than 550 schools have been  sanctioned. Digitization of health care services has been started through  National Digital Health Mission. The hon. President has mentioned the tireless  efforts made by the Government to fight Corona pandemic in his Address in  detail. Our country has not only controlled the pandemic very fast, but also  provided medicines for prevention of this pandemic to many countries of the  world. This has become possible under the effective leadership of our hon.  Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi Ji. We should thank our doctors, nurses,  police and other healthcare workers and front line corona warriors, who are  rendering selfless services to the country without thinking about their lives.  Our scientists and researchers have worked day and night and developed  Covid vaccine just within ten months after lock down which is an achievement  for the country. In 2014, there were only 387 medical colleges in the country,  but today, there are 562 medical colleges in the country. The Government has  sanctioned 22 new AIIMS under \\'Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana\\'.  Our target of \\'Aatmnirbhar Bharat\\' will be further strengthened by  Aatmanirbhar Krishi. More than 1 lakh 13 thousand crore rupees have been  directly transferred to the accounts of small and marginal farmers under \\'PM  Kisan Samman Nidhi\\'. The small farmers of the country have also benefited  under \\'Pradhan Mantri fasal Bima Yojana\\'. It has been mentioned in the  Address that the Government is continuously making efforts to clear confusion  over farm laws. Through these farm reforms, the Government has provided  new facilities and rights to the farmers. The Kisan Rail launched across the  country is a mobile cold storage. The Government has also set up Animal  Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund worth Rs. 15 thousand crore to  set up infrastructure and to promote investment in the dairy sector. Work is  also underway to increase the income of fishermen under \\'Pradhan Mantri  Matsya Sampada Yojana\\'. Construction of 6 lakh 42 thousand kilometer  stretch of road has been completed in the rural areas of the country under  \\'Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana.\\' Providing internet connectivity in the  villages is also very important alongwith the construction of roads.

About 700 divyang-friendly websites have been  developed. Similarly, transgenders have been provided better facilities and  equal opportunities and Development and Welfare Board has been set up for  denotified, nomadic and semi-nomadic communities. It is a happy coincidence  that moving towards 75th anniversary of independence, the construction work  of new Parliament building has been started in the country. The people of  Jammu & Kashmir have been empowered after getting new rights. More than  21 crore poor people have been covered under \\'Pradhan Mantri Suraksha  Bima Yojana\\' at a premium of one rupee per month.

Supporting the motion for thanks I want to  say that the government performed very well by keeping the development and  basic programmes continue even during corona crisis. The nation is further  strengthened with the emergence of Atmanirbhar Bharat under the leadership  of hon\\'ble Prime Minister.  I sincerely support hon.  President\\'s address. It is reflected by the President\\'s address that the Central  Government is taking the country on a new path of rapid economic  development in accordance with its promise of \\'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas\\'.  The poor, downtrodden, exploited, deprived, farmers, workers and youths of  the country are at the center of this inclusive economic development of the  Government. In the central leadership, the honorable Prime Minister Shri  Narendra Modi shows the determination of continuous progress of the  country. I welcome the statement of hon. President that decisions taken under  the leadership of our hon. Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, saved the lives  of millions of our countrymen, as a result of which, there is a rapid decline in  the number of new cases of coronavirus and at the same time there is a  significant increase in the number of recoveries. The Central Government also  took care to ensure that no poor person went hungry.. The Central  Government also launched the \\'Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyan\\' in six states in  order to provide employment to the returnee migrant labourers in their  villages, during the pandemic. An amount of Rs 31,000 crore was directly  transferred to the Jan Dhan accounts of poor women. During this period, more  than 14 crore gas cylinders were given free of cost throughout the country to  poor women beneficiaries, under the Ujjwala scheme. It is a matter of pride  that today India is running the world\\'s largest vaccination campaign. The  entire credit for this goes to the government under the central leadership of  our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. The poor are now able to avail the  benefits of healthcare facilities with ease. Today there are 562 medical  colleges in the country and in the last 6 years, there has been an increase of  over 50,000 seats at the under-graduate and postgraduate levels in medical  education. Now, widespread improvements are being brought in various  sources of irrigation for agriculture. The food grain availability in the country is  at a record high. The Parliament approved 3 important farm reform bills 7  months ago, namely, The Farmers\\' Produce Trade and Commerce  (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection)  Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, and the Essential  Commodities (Amendment) Bill. The benefits of these farm reforms, have  started reaching more than 10 crore small farmers instantly. The Central  Government is constantly trying to remove the confusion created in the  context of these laws. The central government has always respected freedom  of expression and holding of peaceful agitations in a democratic set up. The  recent acts of dishonouring the National Flag and showing disrespect to the  auspicious occasion of the Republic Day are unfortunate. In order to enhance  the profitability of agriculture, the Central Government is also placing  emphasis on creating modern agricultural infrastructure. The Central  Government has been working relentlessly for multi-faceted development of  villages. Under the SVAMITVA scheme, villagers are now acquiring legal  rights over their property. Under the \\'Jal Jeevan Mission‟ water connection is  being provided on priority to brothers and sisters belonging to the Scheduled  Castes & Scheduled Tribes as well as other deprived sections of the society.  The Government has made commendable progress in expanding the network  of rural roads. Several steps have been taken to enhance the role of MSMEs  in the mission aimed at developing an Atmanirbhar Bharat. Keeping in mind  the health concerns of working women in rural areas of the country, the  Government is implementing the „Suvidha‟ scheme under which sanitary  napkins are made available at a nominal cost of Re 1. Keeping in mind the  global requirements and challenges of the 21st century, the Government has  announced the National Education Policy. I also welcome the statement of  hon. President where he said that following the mantra of Sabka Saath,  Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas‟, the Government is prioritizing the development  of all sectors and all sections of the society. It is a happy coincidence that the  construction of a new Parliament House has commenced as we are  approaching the 75th year of our independence. I welcome the statement of  His Excellency the President where he said that the country has also started  emerging from the economic setback suffered in the wake of the coronavirus  pandemic when the focus was primarily on saving the life of each Indian  citizen. I welcome the statement of His Excellency the President where he  said that the development oriented policy of the Government has also  received wholehearted support from the people of Jammu and Kashmir.  Construction of a grand Ram Mandir has commenced after the Supreme  Court judgment. India has moved up from 65 to 34 in the World Tourism Index  ranking. All these works done under the central leadership of Hon\\'ble Prime  Minister Shri Narendra Modi are welcome steps. More than 21 crore poor  were linked to „Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana‟ for a premium of just  Rs. 1 a month. More than 3.5 crore children were vaccinated under „Mission  Indradhanush‟. 100 per cent digitisation of ration cards has been completed.  More than 8 crore gas connections were given free of cost under „Ujjwala  Yojana‟. More than 10 crore toilets were built under „Swachh Bharat Mission‟.  More than 41 crore Jan Dhan accounts were opened for the poor. In this way,  hon. President has not only cited the work done by the Government for the all- round development of the country during the last few years, but also  mentioned the priorities of the Central Government and the steps being taken  by the Government in its second term to steer out the country from global  epidemic crisis of Covid-19 and the steps taken in the meantime which clearly  shows a sense of self-image of our popular government. The Presidential Address embodies the spirit  of \" Sarvajan Hitay, Sarvajan Sukhay\" of the Government and the Modi  Government has been continuously working for the welfare of villages, poor,  farmers and the common people of this country during the last 6 years. Last  year, the world faced a major problem and challenge in the form of Corona  pandemic. It was challenging for all of us to take measures against Corona  due to the large population, diversity of cultural traditions as well as the  natural and geographical challenges of India. However, through strong  leadership and quick action taken in India, we have been able to control the  virus outbreak to an extent greater than many rich and developed countries of  the world.  India was not hugely affected despite the economic recession  happened caused by the Corona pandemic. Through the Pradhan Mantri  Garib Kalyan Yojana, financial assistance has been given to crores of  mothers and sisters and divyang brothers and sisters in the country. Last  year, three agricultural laws have been passed with a majority in both the  houses of the Parliament with an amendment to uplift the farmers and to  make them self-reliant under the leadership of hon. Modi ji. It is a  commendable step of the Government to implement almost all the  recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission made for agricultural  reforms.  In addition to providing \" Har Ghar Jal\" under \"Jal Jeevan Mission\",  water conservation is also being done . During the last 6 years, the  Government has built 6 lakh 42 thousand km roads under Pradhan Mantri  Gram Sadak Yojana and achieved a big goal to connect rural India by the  major roads of the country. The Government is also continuously working to  provide better internet and connectivity in the rural parts of the country.

The power to make India self-reliant is  in the hands of these small industries. The Government has sanctioned  National Education Policy-2020.

Through all these efforts, the  Government has set an example collective strength of federal structure. The  Government is working on making our country \\'Atmanirbhar Bharat\\'. Under  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, a sum of Rs. 1,13,000 crore has been  transferred to the bank accounts of farmers. The hon. President has  given the details of the shape and direction of the country through his  Address. Today, India is moving towards the path of development even during  the time of recession after the Corona period. During the last 6 years, the  Government has tried to bring positive changes in every process in agriculture  sector from seed to market so as to modernize and expand this sector in the  country. Today, the Government is not only making record quantity of  procurement on MSP but is also increasing the number of procurement  centers. Following the mantra of \\'Per Drop More Crop\\', the Government is  making the modern methods of irrigation available to the farmers along with  the completion of previous irrigation projects. Today, the availability of food  grains in the country is at a record level. Today, the production of vegetables  and fruits has increased from 215 million ton to 320 million ton. It is  commendable that more than 9 crores of toilets have been built across the  country.

Under the Pradhan Mantri Gram  Sadak Yojana, 6 lakh 42 thousand kilometers of road has been constructed in  rural areas of the country.      The Government has given a new lifeline to the farmers by  bringing the Agriculture laws and it has also stressed upon making the  farmers independent by the year 2022. More than 100 Kissan Rail have been  run in the country with the help of which more than 38 thousand tons of food  grain, fruits and vegetables have been transported by the farmers. The  Government is paying special attention towards creating modern agriculture  infrastructure to make agriculture a profitable business.  Animal Husbandry  Infrastructure Development Fund worth Rs. 15,000 crore was set up to  promote basic dairy infrastructure and investment in the dairy sector.  The  works undertaken by the Government in the health sector during the last six  years greatly helped the country in the times of  prevailing Corona pandemic.      Today, people are being benefited under Ayushman Bharat  Yojana in more than 24 thousand hospitals across the country.  People of  Jammu and Kashmir have got new rights after the abrogation of Article 370,  and this has brought happiness in their lives.  Citizenship Amendment Act  was passed by the Parliament.

When the highly developed nations of the world  were reeling under the Corona Pandemic and were unable to find out a cure  for this disease despite having robust medical infrastructure in place, our hon.  Prime Minister succeeded in maintaining the lowest mortality rate despite  being the second most populated country of the world. He has made untiring  efforts to make the dream of a new and self-reliant India true and has taken  the welfare schemes to the last person of the society in the entire country. At  the same time, he has laid emphasis on the growth rate and has accorded  priority to North Eastern region, especially to Assam. Hon. Prime Minister has  carried out significant developmental work by revering the entire Northeast as  Asht Lakshmi.  An AIIMS has been set up in Guwahati.

In the Agriculture Sector also, following the mantra of „Par Drop  More Crop‟ the Government is improving the irrigation facilities and it is  commendable that today the food grain availability in the country is at a record  high.   The continuous efforts of the Government to turn the Anndata into  Urjadata are commendable and the benefits of three important farm reforms  bills have started reaching to small farmers instantly. The Government is also  committed to supply water to every household under Jal Jivan Mission.  Also  the four Labour Codes formulated by the Government will ensure the welfare  of labourers.  Our Government‟s development oriented policy has received  wholehearted support from the people of Jammu & Kashmir also. Recently  the local body elections have been conducted there successfully.    Once  again I am thankful to the Hon. President for appreciating the efforts made by  the Government. Following the mantra of \"Sabka  Saath, Sabka Vikas‟\" Government is leading the country on the path of rapid  economic development. Decisions taken through democratic process will be  accepted by all the countrymen. The abrogation of article 370 and 35-A is not  only a historic step, but also paved the way for the development of Jammu  and Kashmir and Ladakh. Now, these are the parts of the mainstream. The  elections to more than 300 Block Development Councils were held  successfully for the first time after Independence. The government has started  Jal Jeevan Mission and Rs 3.60 lakh crore will be spent on this scheme in  coming days. The government is going to spend Rs. 25 Lakh crore to  strengthen the rural economy. The constant increase in MSP of Ravi and  Kharif crops is a step towards this direction. The procurement of pulses and  oilseeds has increased record 20 times with the efforts of the government.  The Kartarpur corridor was constructed in record time and was dedicated to  country at the occasion of Guru Nanak Dev Ji anniversary.

More than 600 one stop centres have been set up for increasing  the sense of security in women. More than 1000 Special Fast track courts will  also be set up across the country. The government will also celebrate the  250th anniversary of Raja Ram Mohan Rai, a great society reformer in 2022  with great fervor and zeal. Cluster based plantation agriculture as well as  organic farming is being promoted. The government will spend Rs. 13  thousand crore under National Animal Disease Control programme for control  of Foot & Mouth Disease. More 5.5 crore farmers are getting the benefit of  crop insurance cover by paying a minimum premium and the claims of Rs. 57  thousand crore under the scheme have been settled. The work to connect  400 additional Mandies with e-NAM is in progress. This platform has recorded  a trade volume of 90 thousand crore. More than 6.60 crore women have  joined the Self-Help Group movement being promoted by the government for  increasing women entrepreneurship. The government\\'s priority is to prepare  youth for leadership. In the last 5 years, 4 times more patents have been  granted in the country while trademark registration has increased by 5 times.  The government has introduced Swayam -2 to strengthen the online  education system.  For almost last six and half years, the  Government has been continuously working for the upliftment of poor,  farmers, dalits, victims, exploited and deprived people along with the safety  and empowerment of women.  This Government has launched many  schemes like Jan-Dhan Yojana, Ujjawal Yojana, Har Ghar Shauchalya  Yojana, Ayushman Bharat Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, and Jan- Aushadhi Yojana, as a result of which the last deprived person in terms of  development has got much relief.  The development oriented politics of Modi ji  has forced the parties involved in vote bank politics, casteism secular and  divisive politics, to talk about development today.  The Government has been  taking continuous steps since the year 2014 to double the income of farmers  by the year 2022.  The farmers have been directly benefited through the Jan- Dhan Yojana.  Pisciculture, animal husbandry, Beekeeping etc. have been  promoted by the Government.  Each year Rs. 6000 crores are being  transferred to the account of farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maan  Dhan Yojana, which has directly helped more than 11,500 crore farmers.  The  Government is always ready to make any amendments to the Agriculture laws  but to ask for repealing of the Agriculture laws enacted by the Parliament in  the interest of the farmers, is actually a contempt of the Supreme Panchayat,  i.e, Parliament of the country.      Special attention has been paid towards development of deprived  North-Eastern region by constructing thousands of kilometers of long  highways, rail network and many new airports.  New universities are being  opened in places like Manipur and Ladakh.  During the global Pandemic of  Corona, 80 crore people were given additional 5 kg. of foodgrain free of cost  for a period of 8 months under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana.  An  economic package was announced to help the country‟s economy.  India is  running world‟s largest vaccination programme by using two vaccines  developed in the country itself.  India is gradually moving towards self-reliance  in various sectors including defence production.  This Government has  provided a sensitive, public welfare oriented and corruption free governance  to the nation.  The opposition must also contribute towards this major  campaign of nation building. In his address, His Excellency the President  informed the people of India about the public welfare schemes of the  Government of India.Today, India has become the largest producer of PPE  kits and masks all over the world. Even today in the case of ventilators, the  country has become completely self-reliant. Today, India is producing two  indigenous vaccines.The Government of India provided free food grains and  pulses to the people through the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana. This  government wants to double the income of the country\\'s farmers and provide  houses to every citizen of the country.The government wants to supply water  to every household in the country under the Jal Jeevan Mission. In the Corona  period, the government also gave economic relief package to the industries. I thank the Hon. President for  his speech to both the Houses of Parliament.  Agriculture and MSME sectors  are the two main pillars of our economy.  In this testing time of Covid -19, the  prime Minister had supported both the sectors.  Eight crore farmers were  given 2000 rupees in their bank accounts by the Government.  A package  was also given to MSMEs to sustain during lockdown period.  I also  congratulate the Prime Minister and scientists of India for the Made in India  vaccine.  We are proud that our Government is providing vaccine to the whole  world. The Government is trying to provide pucca  houses, road connectivity to all habitations, potable water, LPG, toilet and  medical facilities to all.  During this period of pandemic, efforts were going on to  make the country self-reliant and small and medium entrepreneurs are playing  vital role in it.  MSME has emerged as lively and progressive arena of Indian  economy.  MSME helps in increasing national income, ensuring equal distribution  of resources, minimize the regional imbalance and industrialization of rural and  backward areas.  Small and Cottage industry play vital role in social and  economic development of the country.  It is the largest sector for generating  employment opportunities and contributes 29 percent in gross domestic  production.  11 crore people are engaged in this sector and it contributes 50  percent in total export of the country.  Millions of small entrepreneurs have been  benefitted by the Governments efforts like Emergency Credit Line Guarantee  Scheme worth 3 lakh crore, special scheme worth Rs.20,000 crore for distressed  MSMEs and Fund of Funds. Skill development of millions of craftsmen is being  through „Hunar Haat‟ and „Usttad Scheme‟.  The Government has taken several  steps to provide new opportunities to women for self employment.  More than  Rs.25 crore has been disbursed as loan under the MUDRA Yojana and 70  percent of it has been given to women entrepreneurs.

During the last six  years these have been provided loan worth Rs.3,40,000 crore.  The Government  has made several provisions including „Faceless Tax Assessment‟ and Appeal  facility to encourage entrepreneurship in the country. This government is inherited historical  problems. Prime Minister Modi ji\\'s government is engaged in trying to solve the  inherited historical problems and on the other hand it has been facing challenges  with a sense of responsibility  and a strong will. If you ask me the biggest  achievement in these six years including the achievement of our Prime Minister  and his team, then I would say that is the management of COVID-19. If you go  through the report of Economic Survey, you will find that due to the policy and  leadership of this government, about one lakh people have survived and 37 lakh  people have been prevented from this infection. Through the Pradhan Mantri  Garib Kalyan Yojana eighty crore people were ensured five kilo of extra food  grains for eight months. I belong to poorest state of Odisha. Eight lakhs migrant  labourers left-out the State. 244 trains were managed to bring them back. For  this I would like to thank the Hon\\'ble Prime Minister on behalf of the people o the  Odisha. The government led by Modi ji is the  government of the farmers, labourers landless labourers, dalits, backwards,  youth, employees, traders, aged people and women. By providing ten percent  reservation to general category on economic ground the Prime minister has  shown that the central Government is marching ahead with the idea of \\'sabka  saath, sabka vikas and sabka vishwas\\'. The government has formulated serveral  schemes for the farmers. The country saw when the entire world found itself  helpless during outbreak of covid-19 pandemic how our Prime Minister Modi ji  managed the affairs of the country. Our friends in opposition alleged that  imposing lockdown was a wrong decision. But I would like to say that during  lockdown rapid steps were taken to make India self-reliant.  Corona vaccine was  developed under the leadership of Prime Minister. Last year natural calamities hit  many states which were dealt with aptly by the union Government. Rs. 16394  crore have been given to 8 crore and 19 lakh farmers under \\'Kisan Samman  Nidhi\\'. In order to improve the plight of the farmers 18000 crore rupees have  been directly credited into the bank accounts of the farmers. This Government is  paying special attention towards the farmers, the poor and landless labourers.  Farm Laws are a good and important step to double the farmers\\' income. I on my  own behalf and on behalf of my colleagues thank the Government for starting the  construction of new building for Parliament. The important issue of the  country is abrogation of Article 370 which has been an issue of debate across the  country during the past one year.  After abrogating Article 370 and making  Jammu and Kashmir as well as Ladakh a UT, it is the first time in the history of  the country that we have got 7,000 crore rupees in Union Budget after combining  Leh and Kargil from the year 2019-2020 and from 2020-2021.  5,958 crore  rupees have been proposed in this budget during 2021-22.  Overall grant of Rs.  13,000 crore rupees in this budget for two districts of Ladakh has been provided  by this Government till date.  The foundation of development is education.  Hon.  Modi ji has launched Ladakh University and it is running/functioning today.  Two  degree colleges have been opened in Ladakh. CIBS has been given status of  deemed University.  National skill Training Institute has been opened in Ladakh.   This Government has facilitated the upgradation of Food Craft Institute Leh to  Institute of Hotel Management.  A decision to open 20 schools in NCC units has  been taken.  A decision has been taken to open Engineering college in Kargil. If I  talk about health sector, the area of Ladakh is huge.  This Government worked  for providing health facilities to people through telemedicine and sanctioned a  medical college for Ladakh.  Ayush Ministry decided to construct National  Institute of Sowa Rigpa in Ladakh.  If I talk about telecommunications.  This  Government has worked to set up 54 mobile towers equipped with 4G in the past  one year under the Universal Service Obligation Funding.  This Government has  worked to link villages with internet through V-set.  If we talk about air service,  the government has granted 480 crore rupees of Leh Airport and decided to  upgrade it.  It was decided to extend Kargil Airport.  Delhi has been linked directly  to Kargil and the funding that is sent for commercial flights, it has been said to  provide the same from tourism ministry.  Likewise, it is being said to fly civilian  planes after constructing terminal building on Nubra Thoise Airport. This  Government is working on Jojila tunnel to link Kashmir and Ladakh.  Work is in  progress there despite snowfall at 30 degree Celsius temperature.  This  Government has worked to connect Leh to Janskar only in eight hours by getting  the work of Nimo-Padam-Darcha road in past 3 months which was work that  could take 3 years.  Work on Shingo-la tunnel, Tanglang-la tunnel and  Lachulung-la tunnel has been done.  27250 kilometer worth work was done in  Aksai China in 1962 during Congress‟s reign, Ziya Panganak and Chebji valley,  Korsjog, 250 kilometer long length work in Chumur area was done under UPA  Government in 2008.  Jorawar fort in Demjok was dismantled by PLA, China and  till 2012, it constructed an observing point there.  Similarly, China occupied  Ancient Trade point in Dumchele during 2008-09.  When there was Dr. Farukh  Abdullah‟s Government, he was enjoying Article 370 and never let the Gujjar- Bakarwal society which is 100 percent muslim was not allowed to flourish.  Union  Government conducted DDC election after removal of 370 and gave political  reservation to Gujjar-Bakarwal people and uplifted the down-trodden muslim  community.  More than 40,000 panches and sarpanches have been elected,  more than 3,000 block development council Chairman are elected and more than  280 DDC members were elected there and in all of these elections, no bullet was  fired, no one was killed. It has passed hundred years between the  earlier pandemic and the latest one spread across the world.  In these 100 years,  there was only one vaccine produced after forty years; and for the latest one  (pandemic) the vaccine has been produced within eight months under the  leadership of our Hon. Prime Minister.  It is a matter of pride that 60 per cent  vaccine of the world will be produced within Aatmnirbhar Bharat. The cases of  farmers‟ suicide were always reported in Bundelkhand.  But when the Modi  Government came in power, Kisan Nidhi has been launched for the farmers, they  have availed the insurance benefits leading to less suicidal deaths of the farmers  in Bundelkhand. Under the leadership of the Congress, there has been  misinterpretation of our history and culture due to which today even our children  do not feel pride over our history, culture and our forefathers. Bundelkhand is the  place where Shaheed Chandershekhar Azad was provided shelter and he led his  life as a `Sadhu` at the bank of Satara river in Jhansi. There is an acute scarcity  of water in Bundelkhand.  But under the „Har Ghar Jal Yojana‟, the amount of Rs.  12 thousand crore has been allocated to Bundelkhand. I rise to speak on the Motion of  Thanks on the Presidential address. Today, India is running the world\\'s biggest  vaccination drive. Both of the vaccines of this program are made in India. It is a  matter of pride for us. We are helping other nations also to end global Corona  pandemic. In Jammu & Kashmir, the hon. Prime Minister has given his support  on each step against the fight against Corona. Uniform development is going on  in Kashmir and the motto of \\'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas\\' is visible. By conducting  the District Development Council elections after 70 years, the Central  Government has given rights to the people and opened ways of development.  The fund that is being given for the development of Jammu & Kashmir is used  specifically for the project it has been allocated. As a mark of respect, every year,  six thousand rupees is deposited to the bank accounts of every poor farmer.  Farmers are happy with this. After the removal of Article-370, Jammu & Kashmir  is moving towards development. The people are getting the rights which had  been taken away from them. These steps are taking Jammu & Kashmir towards  a better future. The President\\'s address at the Joint Session of  Parliament has been historic and encouraging.  After a global Pandemic like  COVID-19, India has emerged before the world with a new potential.  Through  Vocal for Local, India has not only conquered COVID-19  but also shown the  world the way to move forward  by boosting the economy. During the COVID- 19 pandemic, India, assisted many countries by providing medicines and  vaccines, etc., and also protected humanity by running the world\\'s largest  vaccination campaign.  Employment equivalent to 50 crore mandays has  been created through Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyan. The country has created  a large network to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. All the poor are getting  cheaper medicines through the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Kendras.  In the  year 2020, the number of medical colleges increased to 562 and medical  colleges have increased seats by more than 50 thousand undergraduate and  postgraduate level.  22 new AIIMS hospitals have been opened. Erstwhile,    Medical Council of India has been replaced by the National Medical  Commission. A record increase has been made to the MSP to  farmers. Three  important agricultural reform laws have been legislated  and 100 new Kisan  rail services have been introduced to increase the income of the farmers. The  area under irrigation sector has been enhanced and   yield of foodgrains and  fruits in the year 2020 have also increased. Livestock is growing at 8.2%. By  2022, every poor will have pucca house, under the Water Life Mission, piped  drinking water will be supplied to the door-to-door, construction of 6,42000  kms of road has been completed under Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak  Yojana. A campaign to connect more than 6 lakh villages with optical fibre is  underway and the country has been given a new education policy.  4 labour  codes have been created by reducing 29 central labour laws.  Metro services  are being expanded in the urban areas. India ranks second in the world as a  mobile manufacturer. 9.5 crore people have been linked to Pradhan Mantri  Jeevan Jyoti Yojana. Toilets have been constructed in more than 10 crore  households. All these achievements have mentioned in the President\\'s  address. The President\\'s Address reflects that the  Union Government is fast tracking the country on the new path of economic  development in accordance with its promise of \"Collective Efforts Inclusive  Growth.\\'  The poor, the Dalit, the downtrodden, the deprived, farmers,  labourers and the youth are at the centre of this inclusive economic growth.   The strong foundation of making this decade as the country\\'s decade and this  century as the country\\'s century has been laid with the efforts of the  Government in the last six years.  During this corona crisis we have witnessed  tremendous benefits of  the works performed by our Government in the health  sector during the last six years.  Atmanirbhar Bharat Campaign is not only  restricted to the development of the country but it is also a campaign to uplift  the standard of living and enhance the country\\'s confidence. Self reliance in  agriculture will further strengthen our target. During these years, emphasis  has been laid on modernising the health infrastructure along with taking  preventive measures to check the spread of the disease.  Atmanirbhar Bharat  Campaign is not only restricted to developing the country but is also related to  uplifting the standard of living of every citizen of the country.  Our target would  be further strengthened by self-reliance in agriculture.  With this very thought  this Government has made efforts to bring about positive changes in every  system from sowing seed to marketing of crops during the last six years so  that the Indian agriculture is modernized and also expands.  In the series of its  efforts  the  Government  by  implementing  the  recommendations  of  Swaminathan Commision took the decision to provide MSP at one and a half  times of the cost. Today, the Government is not only procuring crops in record  quantity at MSP but is also increasing the number of procurement centres.   There has been a major improvement in irrigation sources available for  agriculture.  The small and marginal farmers are a priority for the Government.   More than Rs. 1,13,000 crore rupees have directly been transferred in several  bank accounts. The largest benefit of these agriculture reforms has  immediately accrued to more than 10 crore farmers. I welcome and strongly  extend my support to H.E. President\\'s Address showcasing various schemes  and programs introduced by the hon. Prime Minister for fulfilling the dream of  Golden India. Poverty alleviation and development  and implementation of new schemes in the health sector is the only target of  our Government to create a \"Healthy India\".  When we recall the past year,  we remember that how on one hand there was the challenge of saving the  lives of our citizens and on the other hand there was the concern of our  economy.  The Government besides announcing a record economic package  to save the economy has also paid attention that not a single poor person  should starve.  Apart from providing the facility of One Nation-One Ration  Card the government provided free of cost foodgrains to the poor and also  plied Special trains for the labourers.  The Government in all its decisions, has  presented a unique example of collective power of federal structure.  The  coordination between the Centre and the State Governments has  strengthened our democracy and only enhanced the prestige of our  Constitution.  It is a matter of pride for all of us that our country is running the  world\\'s biggest vaccination campaign today.  Both the vaccines under this  programme have been developed in India.  We have witnessed tremendous  benefits of  the works performed by our Government in the health sector  during the last six years during this corona crisis.  \\'Atmanirbhar Bharat\\'  Campaign is not only restricted to the development of the country but it is also  a campaign to uplift the standard of living and enhance the country\\'s  confidence.  The Government with this mindset has made efforts to bring  about positive changes in every system from seeding to the marketing of  crops to give boost to the Indian agriculture market in the last six years.   Today, my Government is not only procuring crops in record quantity at MSP  but is also increasing the number of procurement centres.  There has been a  major improvement in irrigation facilities available for agriculture.  The small  and marginal farmers are a priority for the Government.  More than Rs.  1,13,000 crore rupees have directly been transferred in the bank accounts of  such farmers through PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana with a view to provide  assistance in their small expenditures.  The Government is consistently  working for the multi-dimensional development of the villages today.  My  Government\\'s priority is to uplift the standard of living of the rural people.  Its  best example is construction of two crore houses for the poor families from  the year 2014.  The Government has done a commendable job by expanding  the network of rural roads for fulfilling the needs of 21st century rural India and  equipping them with infrastructure. Providing internet connectivity along with  roads in the rural areas is equally important. After cent per cent rural  electrification, the Government is running a campaign to provide optical fiber  connectivity in more than six lakh villages of the country.  The small scale  industries, the village industries and MSMEs spread across in our villages and  small towns are the fundamental strength of our economy.  Several measures  have also been taken to expand the role of MSMEs in Atmanirbhar Bharat.   The Government has declared the National Education Policy in view of global  needs and challenges of 21st century.  The Government has also constituted  National Recruitment Agency to provide relief to the youth of the country from  appearing in separate examinations.  The Government is according priority to  every sector and ensuring development of every community with the mantra  of \\'Sabka Saath Sabka Vishwas.\\' Consistent measures are being taken to  improve \\'Ease of Doing Business\\' in the country.  Healthy competition is being  promoted among the States for this purpose.  Our country has emerged as a  destination of attraction for global investors even during such a difficult time.   The Government believes that the development of modern infrastructure will  lay a strong foundation for a new self reliant India.  Expeditious  implementation of several major infrastructural projects and their completion  even during Corona period shows our commitment.  The Government is also  working on national infrastructure pipeline at a cost of more than 110 lakh  crore rupees.  Today, the world stands a witness to the seriousness with  which the country is fulfilling its global responsibilities even during corona  period.  The Government has shown if our intentions are clear and we are  willful and determined, changes can be brought about. During the pandemic, the country  showed our collective response and strength to fight and curb the COVID- 19   infection and at the same time, we are able to increase the recovery rate like  anything in the country.  We are all empowering through awakening calls of  Atmanirbhar Bharat.  The glaring example is COVID Vaccine, which is made  in India.  Our COVID vaccines are the symbols of India\\'s Swadeshi.  I belong  to the North-Eastern Region of India, and more specifically representing inner  Manipur  Parliamentary  Constituency.    I  have  seen  the  dramatic  developmental changes in the region.  The Region has been experiencing  unprecedented developmental growth during the tenure of the Government.   We hope the streams of development along the valley of the Brahmautra and  the Barak shall transform the region. In his address ,the President has  presented the picture of all-round development induced by the Union  Government during the last six years. Our government seems to be making  continuous efforts to achieve the goal of the self-reliant India, development of  agriculture sector and increase the income of farmers all over India. More  than 10 crore small farmers have begun to get the biggest benefit of  agricultural reforms immediately. We have seen huge benefits of the  remarkable work done by the government during the last six years in the  health sector during the Corona crisis in the country. The government is  continuously working for the multi-dimensional development of villages today.  With the SWAMITVA scheme launched by the government, now the villagers  have started getting legal rights to their property. With this right of ownership,  it will now be easier to take a bank loan on properties in villages as well and  the economic activity in the rural area will intensify. Our government has also  done commendable work in expanding the rural road network to connect  villages with the needs and infrastructure of the 21st century. Connectivity of  internet is equally important along with roads in villages. After providing  electricity, water and roads to every village, the government is running a  campaign to connect more than 6 lakh villages with optical fiber. The  government has been fully successful in protecting the countrymen from  global epidemics like Corona, floods in many states, earthquakes, heavy  cyclones, locusts attacks, bird flu and other disasters. I am satisfied that the  government has been successful in saving the lives of millions of countrymen  with the right decisions taken on time. This time India in the leadership of  Narendra Modiji combated the global challenge of Corona and which has  been praised not only in India but also by the Director General of World  Health Organisation.  For PPE kit the Prime Minister invoked to decrease the  dependence on other countries and march towards self reliance.  Despite the  challenge of Covid, we became self sufficient.  During this year we saved the  lives of people, today our scientists developed the vaccine.  Due to the efforts  of the Government we have become the most favourite destination in foreign  investment.  With the beginning of Covid, the global foreign direct investment  fell by 42 per cent in 2020 in comparison to the year 2019, but in India FDI  registered an increase of 13 per cent.  Today, India is heading towards  becoming the financial services Hub in the world.  Despite the lock down, the  Government has transferred 70 thousand under the Garib Kalyan Package to  42 crore people.  The Ministry of Defence has decided to manufacture 101  equipments indigenously.  We are marching towards Atmanirbhar Bharat.    Farmers will be paid 150 per cent of their yield cost. For the first time  this guarantee has been given by the Narendra Modi Government in the  House to the farmers of the country.   Mandi Committees will exists one  thousand mandis have been connected to electronic national agriculture  market and another one thousand mandis are going to be connected.  For the  first time, 10 crores farmers of the country are being awarded 6 thousand  rupees under Kisan Samman Nidhi. For the first time, the Government is  making 86 per cent small and marginal farmers of the village self-reliant.  Shri Chandeshwar Prasad: I support the Motion of Thanks to the  President\\'s Address. Today, the world\\'s largest vaccination campaign is  running in India.  Sir, I would like to drawthe attention of the Government  towards the problems of my Parliamentary Constituency.  Due to CORONA,  the operation of various trains on Zahanabad-Gaya route was stopped, but  services of these trains have not started again. The passengers are facing a  lot of difficulties. Therefore, the services of these trains must start again.  Manpur-Islampur Rail Line should be layed. Food Processing Industries  should be set up in Arwal and Zahanabad districts including Atari Legislative  Assembly Constituency under Zahanabad Parliamentary Constituency. There  is a huge scope of tourism at many places in Zahanabad, Arwal and Gaya. A  scheme should be formulated to provide tourist infrastructure at those places.  A Super-specialty hospital should be set-up in Zahanabad and Arwal. Drinking  water facility should be provided to the people of this area by formulating a  comprehensive scheme. A Central School should be established in Arwal  District Headquarter. With the successful efforts of Hon. Prime  Minister, a strong image of our country has emerged before the whole world.   Today, the whole world is looking towards us with hope and optimism in view  of our fulfilment, of our global responsibilities during this corona pandemic.   Along with the Parliament, the Government has also set up new records,  whether it is a matter of removing Article 370, Section 35A from Jammu- Kashmir or Triple Talaq of Muslim women, or verdict of Supreme Court on  Ayodhya and various global indices such as Ease of Doing Business which  are the real achievement of the Government. India has the lowest death rate and  highest recovery rate during the Corona pandemic.  Our own indigenously  developed Co- vaccine and Covishield  are ready.  Economic package to the  tune of 29 Lakh 87 thousand crore has been announced under ‗Atmanirbhar  Bharat‘ campaign in which monthly 5 Kg food grains were distributed free of  cost to 80 crore people, 14 crore free gas cylinders were given, ₹ 31 thousand  crores were transferred into the Jan Dhan accounts of poor women and 50  crore man days of employment was generated in 6 states through Garib  Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyan.  The Government has made very important decisions  in the defence sector.    The Government‘s commitment to social justice was also mentioned in  the hon‘ble Presidents‘ Address.  OBC have 60 per cent population in country  and for many years there has been a demand in our country to constitute a  separate Ministry for Other Backward Classes.  The upper limit of income for  OBC creamy layer should be increased from 6 Lakhs to 15 Lakhs.  The  families of gazetted rank should also be given the benefit of OBC reservation.    An agreement was reached in Paris in 2015 to mitigate the negative  effects of climate change.  In which, 189 countries resolved to stop the  temperature rise at two degrees Celsius.  India is the only country among G- 20 countries that has achieved this target.  The Government is working on  projects such as solar, wind, biomass and hydropower.  This is a  commendable step.  Under the Ease of living, the Government has now  pledged to provide clean drinking water.  There is a shortage of judges in the  courts of the country, due to which cases are not disposed of on time and to  ensure the participation of all sections of the society in the posts of judges, I  demand from the Government to constitute an All India Judicial Service. I support the Motion of thanks on  Presidents‘s Address.  Our scientists have developed two Corona vaccines  during global Corona pandemic crises.  The Government has equally worked  for urban as well as rural areas.  The Government have taken steps to  promote MSME sector.  It has also formulated a new education policy.  The  participation of women in various areas of activities has also been enhanced.  The Government has decided to introduce ‗One Nation, One Ration Card‘ in  32 states in coming days.  The Government is working for qualitatively  strengthening fifteen thousand Government schools and going to constitute a  commission for higher education.  The Government proposes to launch  National Language Translation Mission.  The digital payment system has  been introduced in the country and next census will be conducted through  digital mode.  The Government has provided 3.5 lakhs for feeder separation in  rural areas for next five years.  The Government will provide one crore new  gas connections to women under Ujjwala Yojana.  Under the Svamitva  Scheme the rural people would get land ownership rights and use their  property as financial asset to get loans from Banks.  The Government has  introduced three laws for betterment of system and better future of farmers.   These laws will not cause any harm to them rather they will promote trade and  storage facilities in villages.  The Government is providing subsidy on  agricultural equipments and introduced Kisan Rail for transportation of  foodgrains, fruits and vegetables from one place to other.  The future of aged  farmers have been secured under PM Kisan Maandhan Yojana.  I urge that  farmers should also shift from traditional farming to commercial farming or  incentive farming.  We should promote vegetables, fruits farming and dairying.   The Government has implemented GST and approved the proposal regarding  construction of four major freight corridors. During Corona, 80 crore people  benefited from the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana in the country  and more than 7 crore people have benefited from this scheme in my  Constituency. In my state Maharashtra, more than 7 lakh mothers and women  have benefited under the Ujjwala scheme. In Maharashtra the Central  Government has provided the highest number of PPE kits, ventilators,  ambulances, sanitizers, beds, masks and 42 corona testing labs and many  more facilities from the PM Cares Fund.  Due to opening of more than 500  generic medicine outlets under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana  aimed at providing affordable medicine in Maharashtra people are getting  cheaper treatment. People are benefiting from the AIIMS established in  Nagpur. In Maharashtra, 12 lakh families have benefited under the Pradhan  Mantri Awas Yojana. Under this scheme, housing facility has been provided to   50 thousand people in my district. Jalyukt Shivar Scheme was implemented in  Maharashtra. Under this scheme, more than six lakh projects were completed  in 22 thousand villages. It is unfortunate that the State Government has put  this scheme in cold bag. Today, an FIR has been filed against two great  personalities. In the Corona period, the farmers of Maharashtra got special  benefit through the Kisan Rail. The Government has provided free vaccine to  doctors and others. I whole heartedly thank the Government for this. Chit fund was envisaged for the help and  support of the poor but it has been misused as an instrument to loot them.  This  is very deep-rooted.  This has especially tarnished the image of people in  politics.  Poor people invest their money because of faith but their entire  investment has been looted.  I feel the steps the Government is taking are very  good.  Hon. Finance Minister should address all the issues raised hon. Members.   More than 250 chit fund companies are there in West Bengal only.  This Bill  should certainly be passed rather it should be made more stringent.  I would like to thank the hon. Prime  Minister and the Minister of Home Affairs for bringing in the Jammu and Kashmir  Reorganization Bill and a Statutory Resolution.  Sardar Ballabh Bhai Patel, Bhim  Rao Ambedkar and Shayama Prasad Mukherjee had opposed the inclusion of the  Article 370 in the Constitution at the time of its inclusion.  But the politics of  vested interests got it included in the Constitution.  What has the Article 370 so far  brought to Jammu and Kashmir?  Article 370 has only widened the gap between  India and Jammu and Kashmir.  It has provided nothing else but unemployment,  corruption and terrorism to the people of Jammu and Kashmir.  No one is ready to  set up a big factory in Jammu and Kashmir as no one can purchase land over there.   I would like to tell you that the people from all over the country are availing of the  benefits of \\'Ayushman Bharat Scheme\\' but the people of Jammu and Kashmir are  deprived of the benefits of this scheme.  This is only because there is no big  hospital nor anyone is ready to set up big hospital there.  The entire country was  celebrating the passing of the Bill which was intended to provide 10 per cent  reservation to the poor of general category but the people of Jammu were  disappointed because this legislation could not be enforced in Jammu and Kashmir.   Hence, the people want that Article 370 and 35A associated with Jammu and  Kashmir should be scrapped.  If the daughters of Jammu and Kashmir are got  married in other States, she has to lose her identity.  All her relations come to an  end.  I would also like to state that the entire country is aware of what happened to  Kashmiri Pandits.  So, Kashmiri Pandits will not be in a position to live with peace  unless and until they are properly rehabilitated.    In fact, Jammu and Kashmir  has been relegated to the category of a backward State only because of the Article  370 and 35A.  The States where  Article 370 is not enforced, people are happy and  prosperous.  The condition of the refugees of West Pakistan is still quite pitiable  though they have been living in Jammu and Kashmir for the last 70 years.  Today,  history will be created here in the House. It is very clearly  mentioned that Article 370 is a temporary provision.  When it is being abrogated,  there is no need to make such an issue out of it.  We have seen that in the passage  of every Bill we find that the provisions of the Bills are applicable to the entire  country except to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.  After the passage of this Bill,  we will not have this anomaly.  We believe that we will have the best governance  after the bifurcated status of the State of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.  The  country is going to be very safe and the real dreams of people will come true in the  coming days.   The Government now should take all initiatives to bring Kashmiri  Pandits back.  With abolition of 35A, I am sure, wonderful developments are going  to take place in fields of tourism, IT and in every other sphere.  Many other  anomalies would be removed and corrected after the passage of this Bill and we  are going to see a beautiful Kashmir hereafter.     My Party and I myself are in support of the  resolution to accord J&K and Laddakh the status of Union Territories.  It has been   a long pending demand.  This move has sent a wave of immense pleasure among  the masses particularly among the Buddhist followers of Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar.   In fact, Dr. Ambedkar happened to make a statement disapproving of the draft of  Article 370 wherein he said on record that the residents of Kashmir have equal  rights to grow in India as is available to the other citizens of the country.  Contrary  to his wishes the citizens of India have been barred from settling down, or  acquiring land or entering into trade and profession in Kashmir.  This is totally  unacceptable.  I support this Bill. This is a historic Bill brought in by  the Government.  I rise to support this Bill on behalf of our Party.  This apart, I  would like to urge upon the hon. Minister to have plan B in  place to convert POK  into IOK somewhere down the line.  Part 2 of the Jammu Reorganization Bill  consists of two main issues.  One of these pertains to the formation of Union  Territory of Laddakh without an assembly Legislature and the other one is  concerning formation of Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir  with an assembly  Legislature.  This is welcome move and has been hailed by the masses concerned.   Earlier, I happened to be part of a delegation to Kashmir and received firsthand  accounts of the pathetic condition people of J&K, who have been reeling under for  years together.  We learnt from the masses that there is no development in J&K  even tourism is in rough patch.  So is the case with employment and industrial  development.  So finding the happy medium seemed to be  the best way forward.  Yesterday, many people were saying that it is a dark day.  How can it be a dark day  if development will reach all the people, employment will be provided, industries  will be set up in Kashmir?  Therefore, it is not a dark day rather it is a  revolutionary day, a day of development.  Yesterday, hon. Home Minister has told  that he will make it number one state in the matter of development in the next five  years.  Jobs will be provided to the Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, youths of Kashmir.   Till now, there was no development in Kashmir, therefore, we are supporting this  Bill due to these promises.  Kashmir is a paradise on earth.  It is sad that we could  not protect beautiful Kashmir for so long. The people of Kashmir are lovely  people. Injustice has been done to them for so long.  We are supporting this Bill to  bring justice to them. It is a historic day when  historical mistakes have been rectified. Ladakh has been neglected for the last 71  years with vehement demand for U.T. status ever since but this never seized the  deserved attention of the powers that be in the past.   Ladakh has its unique culture.  Abrogation of Article 370 will certainly make the future of Jammu and Kashmir  bright.  Every religious organization has demanded U.T. status for Ladakh.  Some  people say that there will be no equality in Jammu and Kashmir in the absence of  Article 370 whereas they themselves meted out step-motherly treatment to Ladakh.   Article 370 has been misused against the minorities in Jammu and Kashmir.  I  thank the Government of India and all the hon. Members who supported this Bill. Our Government has taken a historic  decision and I on my behalf and on the behalf of my Party extend our heartfelt  thanks to hon. Prime Minister and hon. Home Minister.  Until now, we just heard  about the united India but today the country has been united in real terms.  We  ourselves alienated Kashmir from the whole country by inserting the Article 370 in  our Constitution.  Today the leaders of opposition parties have also accepted that  we are fulfilling the promises made by us at the time of election.  Jammu and  Kashmir remained detracted from the path of development and progress for so  many years.  Now it will join the journey of development and progress.  Laddakh  has also got its own identity and after becoming the Union Territory, the wishes of  aspirations of the people of the State will also be fulfilled by this historic decision  taken by our Government. I rise to support the Bill.  Article 370 of our  Constitution, being a temporary provision has to go for the good of the people of  Jammu and Kashmir.  In effect, a historical mistake that took place about 70 years  ago is now being corrected through this Bill.  All sorts of assistance was provided  to the State of Jammu and Kashmir in the past but everything went into drain.  In  return, we got bloodshed and terrorism.  Our own Kashmiri pundits have been  thrown out of Kashmir.  Complete integration of Jammu and Kashmir into India  will be one nation with one flag and one Constitution.  Infrastructural facilities,  peace and prosperity across the region will improve.  The hon. Home Minister is  on record saying that as soon as the situation normalizes, Jammu and Kashmir  would be made as a full-fledged State.  This House may kindly be enlightened if   he has set any timeline in this regard.  I want to know as to what supplemental,  incidental and consequential measures the Government is going to take for Jammu  and Kashmir. I stand in support of the Bill.  My party  Shiromani Akali Dal clearly stands for a strong federal set up but, at the same time,  we believe in a strong and united India.  During partition, when a lot of minorities  shifted from Pakistan to the rest of India and J&K, they were given equal amount  of property or some compensation but the people from Pak Occupied Kashmir or  from Pakistan who migrated to Jammu & Kashmir have not got any compensation  till date.  Minorities of Jammu & Kashmir are depressed and suppressed because  there was no Minority Commission in Jammu & Kashmir.  A lot of residents of  Jammu and Kashmir have settled down in Punjab.  They have bought land in  Punjab but people of Punjab cannot buy land in Jammu and Kashmir.  I  congratulate the Prime Minister and the Home Minister for taking this bold  decision. I rise to support this Bill.  Had Sardar  Ballabh Bhai Patel handled the Kashmir issue, the current situation would not have  emerged.  Kashmiri people have not developed a connect with the rest of the  country only because of this Article 370.  Many important laws are not enforced in  Kashmir due to this Article.  If a Kashmiri girl marries a man from any other State,  she loses her Kashmiri citizenship.  Democracy in the valley has been suppressed  and corruption flourished due to this Article 370.  The Government of India  provides huge packages to this State yet it failed to register development.  So, I  congratulate the Government for today\\'s decision.  This decision is going to change  the history of India, not geography.  The people of who went to Kashmir, even after  70 years, they are still nomads.  This Bill has been brought to deliver justice to  those people.   Even a single Member of Congress party did not utter even a single  word about Reservation Bill because reservation is not in their behaviour.  This  Bill is the last nail in the legislation which you had been legislated against  Kashmir.  From today, the whole India has been united in a true sense.  I am happy  today that our generation is the witness of the time when Article 370 is being  repealed. I feel that we will get the real  independence today with the passage of this Bill.  The credit for this independence  definitely goes to those soldiers who had been fighting and laying down their lives  for this issue for the last 70 years.  I would like to thank the Government for  bringing in this Bill in the very first session.  I believe that this Bill matters a lot for  the youths and hence I support this Bill. It has been clearly mentioned in the  Constitution to promote brotherhood, to give respect to each citizen and provide  equal rights to everyone.   But Congress and two families from Jammu and  Kashmir kept playing games with the people there for their vested interests.  Had  Nehruji not ordered ceasefire then even Lahore would have been a part of India  today.  Shri Shyama Prasad Mukherji was murdered in Kashmir in 1953 when he  had gone there to oppose the permit and particularly Article 370.  Congress did not  even order an enquiry into his murder.  I support this Bill. Today, we all can celebrate Holi and Diwali  today itself.  Today it is the day of culmination of all the hard work that was being  done by our party for the last 70 years, the purpose for which agitations were being  held continuously, the purpose for which our first President Shyama Prasad  Mukherji gave away his life.  For this, I would like to congratulate hon. Prime  Minister, hon. Home Minister in particular on behalf of all the workers and all the  people that they brought such a Bill and that this Bill is being passed before us.    The mistake made by the Congress party, the mistake made by Nehruji due to  which we suffered so much, that mistake has been corrected today. I rise to support, on behalf of Shiv  Sena, the Amendment Bill brought to remove Article 370 and make Jammu and  Kashmir a Union Territory.  I pay respects to the jawans who laid down their lives  for the protection of Jammu and Kashmir since independence.  Today, every  Indian from Kashmir to Kanyakumari  is feeling overjoyed.  Kashmir is paradise of  India.  But unfortunately the Congress Government has, in the last 72 years, tried  to destroy this paradise.  Today, the people of Kashmir have achieved freedom in  the true sense for which they had been waiting.  Something should also be done for  the Kashmiri Pandits who got displaced due to Article 370. This Bill will pave the way for bringing self- respect and dignity to a marginalized society.  This Bill substantiates that we have  not been treating transgender as per what the Constitution mandates us to do.  So, it  is a laudable move.  I had gone through the Bill and did not find a provision  treating transgender as OBCs as per an earlier judgement of  the Supreme Court.   So, I request the hon. Minister to please consider this.  With these observations,  hoping that my suggestions will be taken into consideration, I support the Bill. I rise to support the historic Bill.  This  Bill established a law for lakhs of transgender persons who have been deprived of  their rights.  To bring the marginalized communities to the centre is a core  objective of this Bill.  It is shameful that access to basic facilities and basic  services is not given to them.  This is the more failure.  The State Governments and  the Central Government will prepare their own Health Manual.  I would like to say  that it is this Government which has stood by the marginalized whether it is was  the Muslim women, whether it was the SCs, STs and now, the transgenders who  have always been respected in Indian society. I would like to thank the Prime Minister of the   country and the Minister of Social Welfare and Empowerment for bringing in this  Bill for the protection of the rights of the transgender persons and for their welfare.   This Bill has been amended as per the recommendations made by the  Parliamentary Standing Committee.  The transgender persons are viewed with a   discriminatory approach in our society.  Hence, all the possible efforts are required  to be made to bring them into the mainstream of the society.  I support this Bill  which is intended to provide opportunities of education, employment and  healthcare facilities to the transgender persons. Even today the transgender persons  are subject to social boycott and discrimination in our society.  They have to face a  number of difficulties in the pursuit of earning their livelihood.  Not only that, they  are compelled to take recourse to begging.  This Bill provides for adequate  measures for the recognition of the identity of the transgender persons, equal  opportunity of education and employment, social security and healthcare facilities  along with eliminating the discrimination being meted out to them.  At the same  time, such a mechanism is required to be set up that may facilitate the persons of  this community to avail of the pension benefits.  With these words, I support this  Bill. Transgender community in the  country is a community which is most marginal because they do not fit under the  general categories of male or female.  As a result thereof, they have had been  facing problems like social boycott, discrimination, lack of educational facilities,  unemployment, lack of medical facilities etc.  Today, the Government has tried to  bring equality to them.  In clause 6 of this Bill, a provision has been made for the  education, social security and health of the transgenders separately.  The  Government has been taking not only one but many welfare measures for them.   There is a provision for constituting a national council for the transgenders.  A  facility of pension could have been provided to them on the lines of handicapped  persons.  This Bill will remove the pain or harassment faced by the families,  especially the parents on the birth of transgender children.  This Bill will provide to  the transgenders not only the Right to Equality in the society but also remove the  feeling of being a separate category from their mind.  Today is an historic day, I  support this Bill. Only we have discriminated against the people  of transgender community in the society.  The society has not tried to understand  their feelings.  They  also  have the right to live in the society but they have to get  separated from their family itself.  Due to lack of understanding, the parents  abandon their transgender children.  Now, after the passing of this Bill, the parents  will not behave with their transgender children in this manner because now they  will not be required to give answer to the questions raised by the society.  It is a  very important Bill and our Government deserves accolades for that because this  Bill has been brought to reform the society.    I applaud the Government for their effort to  regulate the practice of surrogacy.  I request the Minister to reconsider the  provision which lays down the waiting time of five years.  The Bill should define  \\'close relative\\' term clearly.  I also request the Minister to ensure anonymity of the  surrogate.  There should not be any overlap of authority between the national and  state level boards.  The Bill must provide a review and appeal procedure for  surrogacy applications which would give couples the right to challenge the  decision of the Boards.  There should be single uniform agenda to guide doctors or  patients.  The Government should invite successful surrogacy specialists on board  and consult with them to give a decent plan for the aspiring parents. I would like to congratulate the hon\\'ble  Minister for this Bill. It will streamline the practice of surrogacy in our country.  The hon\\'ble Minister has made a lot of provisions for ethical surrogacy in the Bill  like the setting up of National and State Boards. Board will be set up at national  and state level. These Boards will advise people regarding the Central Government  policy matters relating to surrogacy.  The National Surrogacy Board will also  supervise the state bodies.  There is a regulation in the Bill that only “close  relatives” can be surrogate mother and no one else could be. It has some problem  as the speaker prior to me has said – ‘closeness’ is not defined here. Suppose some  spouse live in orphanage who does not have any close relatives and if some  infertility case comes before them, where will they approach and who will become  their close relative in such a situation? I would like the Minister to ponder over  this. The provisions of penalty in the Bill are very good. If you want to implement  the penalty in a proper way and if you want to regulate it, some kind of inspection  mechanism should be there. The inspection mechanism should be better to  implement rules and regulations in a proper manner and see their effect, otherwise  problem will occur. This Bill aims to regulate the  surrogacy services in the country. This Bill prohibits the sale and purchase of  human embryos and gametes.  This Bill prevents commercialization of surrogacy  and prohibits potential exploitation of surrogate mothers.  This Bill aims to protect  the rights of children born through surrogacy.  Infertility is growing in India.  Surrogacy is helpful in such cases. Surrogacy has become powerful way of saving  marriages of childless couples.  It is mentioned in the Bill that a surrogate mother  should be a close relative. I would like to know from the hon\\'ble Minister as to  what is the definition of a close relative.  Our Government is sensitive towards  women, their safety, their health and dignity. I support this Bill. I support the Bill introduced by hon\\'ble  Minister of Health.  Along with this, I want to see in practice that it is implemented  in a transparent, disciplined way and with a far-reaching approach in the context of  practice and process of surrogacy. But with this facility we’ll have to ensure that it  is accepted easily in our society and this acceptability will be there only when the  surrogate mother belongs to that very family. Woman should not be treated as  machine of reproduction. There should be special provision in this regard. As it is  being practiced in hospitals, clinics, we should be very much concerned about the  health of would be mothers. There should be thorough investigation of the couple  before State or Central Board and permission should be given only if they are  found unfit for reproduction. Second, we have to strictly keep an eye on such  women who are engaged in commercial surrogacy. This treatment is costly, the  poor cannot adopt it.  There should be some provision in this Act for our those  poor sisters who remain in distress due to their infertility.  I thank you while  supporting this Bill from the core of my heart. I support Supreme Court (Number of Judges)  Amendment Bill, 2019.  There has been remarkable change in the judicial system  during the tenure of the hon. Law Minister.  I would like to request the hon. Law  Minister that the language used in the courts in various States should be respective  official language of that State.  It would bring about great change in the judicial  system. Litigation is becoming costly and cost of litigation in the Supreme Court is  even more.  The Government should study it and try to address this issue.  I would  like to appreciate the Supreme Court that cases are disposed of expeditiously there.   A number of hon. Members have put forth their views regarding National Judicial  Appointments Commission.  Our Government has taken concrete steps to improve  the judicial system.  We are moving ahead towards a new India.  Our Law Minister  should try to take steps to ensure disposal of all the pending cases in the country by  the year 2022.  Those who remember their  history, progress.  Today, we are discussing the incident of Jallianwala Bagh and I  would like to inform the House that the facts should be recorded in the history.   Grandfather of a leader of this Party in Punjab  had sent a telegram to General  Dyer approving his action at Jallianwala Bagh.  This is recorded history.  I would,  once again, like to say that this Bill is a perfect Bill.  How the leader of a Party  which approved of the action at Jallianwala Bagh and attacked the Akal Takht  Saheb, be kept on the Trust of Jallianwala Bagh. I rise to support the  Jallianwala  Bagh National Memorial (Amendment) Bill on behalf of my Party Shiv Sena.  As I  know Jallianwala Bagh is the memorial of cruelty of Britishers and symbol of  patriotism as well.  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre took place in the year 1919 and  now it has completed hundred years.  There was a movement of Salt Satyagrah in  the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi.  Britishers had imposed tax on salt and during  that time Mahatma Gandhi crossed from Shiroda village which lies in my  Parliamentary Constituency Sindhudurg.  Whenever freedom struggle was fought  in the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, all those places must be turned into a  memorial to preserve the history.    Jallianwala Bagh massacre was  not an ordinary incident.  The seeds of this incident were sown immediately after  the revolt of 1857.  Thereafter, when Gandhiji returned to India from Africa, he  raised his voice against the Rowlatt Act and he also carried out Satyagrah against  it.  Wide-spread protests were launched against the Rowlatt Act in each and every  city of Punjab.  General Dyre resorted to extreme brutalities to suppress the  movement. His statement before the enquiry committee is a testimony of his sheer  brutality.  A child named Udham Singh was the witness of that massacre who later  took a vow to resort to unfailing retaliatory move. More than 350 people were  martyred and 1500 people were injured in the Jallianwala Bagh incident.  So, I  support this Bill which seeks to amend the Sections of this Bill. I rise to support the Jallianwala Bagh  National Memorial (Amendment) Bill, 2019.  It is essential to remember Sardar  Udham Singh ji on this occasion.  So, first of all, I would pay my homage to him  and to the martyrs of Jallianwala Bagh incident.  Through this Bill, we are not  taking such step which may cause any injustice to the people of this country. Our  Government has built many such memorials of several eminent persons but our  Government has never made a claim that member of such memorial trust would be  from our party.  We used to listen stories of the gory incident of Jallianwala Bagh  during our childhood days and I feel that Jallianwala incident was the only incident  which had shaken the whole nation. National memorial should be built on every  place which is related to the freedom struggle of our country.  There is also a need  to build a national memorial at Chhawani Shahid in my district.  The Government  has been definitely striving for running these institutions in an impartial manner.  I  feel that if these institutions are represented by the Government and the people  having history background, the functioning of such institutions could be  streamlined. This Parliament has been a witness to a large  number of debates on historical issues.  I would like to thank the Government of  India for inspiring the Parliament of the country to discuss the matters of historical  importance.  The national movement should not be dragged into the political  debate.  I would like to submit that the efforts should also be made to ensure that  the debate which is going on the historical issues does not turn into a farce.   History has so much vigour that no one can dare to change it.  I agree to the fact  that all the memorials of this country should be maintained by the Ministry of  Culture. The Dam Safety Bill has been presented in  Lok Sabha to ensure safety, proper monitoring, inspection and operation of dams  in the country and I appreciate such move.  The duties and functions of all the  committees proposed in the Bill have been defined. Through this Bill, water can be  supplied to water scarcity areas from those areas having excess of water so as to  address the problem of farmers. I have witnessed the flood situation in my  parliamentary constituency, Sheohar, Sitamarhi, Motihari districts of Bihar where  people have suffered loss of life and property which is quite painful.  There is a  need to construct dams for storage of water. The Government should hold positive  dialogue with the Government of Nepal so as to find a solution of the problem at  the earliest.  There is a provision to provide fund for relief measures under the  National Disaster Response Fund, but I urge that compensation for loss caused by  flood should be provided through the said fund.  The main concern related to large  dams is that these dams are not maintained properly.  Lakhs of people are living  around large and small dams across the country including my parliamentary  constituency, Sheohar.  It is matter of concern that about 75 per cent of the large  dams are more than 25 years old and about 150 dams are more than 100 years old.   I support this Dam Safety Bill presented by the Government in public interest from  the bottom of my heart. The first time the idea of bringing about a Bill  of this nature to protect the dams of this country originated in the year 1982. This  particular attempt, I am sure, will bear fruit because this particular Bill is brought  about under Article 246 of the Constitution of India read with Entry 56 and 91 of  List 1.  It is being argued by the Opposition that the Union Government does not  have the legislative competence to legislate on matters.  The Union Government  derives the legislative competence to legislate on all matters under Article 246 of  the Constitution of India.  The legislation is primarily to look after maintenance,  surveillance and safety of the dams and has nothing absolutely whatsoever in  controlling the ownership, controlling of water or any other such ancillary subjects  which the Opposition may have any fears over.  Two specific issues are attributed  to make this legislation imperative.  As per the CAG Report of 2017, only two  States, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, out of the 17States conducted a pre-monsoon  and post-monsoon audit on the safety of their dams.  As per the World Bank report  of 2002 most of the dam safety regulations are made at the federal level in the most  of the countries.  There are penal provisions in this Bill, which will enforce the  guidelines of the National Dam Safety Authority as well as the State Dam Safety  Organizations.  This Bill will be a more comprehensive legislation if consequent  penal provisions are also incorporated in this Bill to fix the accountability of errant  officials or errant owners of the dams. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code has been  successful in achieving its targets.  With the help of this Code, banks have been  able to increase the rate of recovery from 23 to 43 per cent from the insolvent  industries.  India\\'s ranking has also seen improvement in the matter of insolvency.   This amendment Bill will help the authorities to take speedy decisions.   In terms  of insolvency, India ranked 134 which has since galloped to the 26th position.  Not  just that, even in terms of ease of doing business we have been able to move up  from 133rd position to 77th.   In the year, 2018 our country has been conferred  upon Global Restructuring Review award.  Coming to the Bill, earlier, it took four  years and three months the resolve cases of insolvency which has now been  reduced to 324 days.  As per the statistics available, out of the subjudice cases  under the I.B.C. as few as 32 per cent cases are older than 270 days.  It merits  attention here that earlier, there was binding of 270 days, yet a good number of  matters used to get stuck in court cases.  Seeing that, the timeline for the disposal  of all the disputes has since been extended to 330 days.  It is a very good step.  As  per the provisions of the Bill, NCLAT and DRT will have to accept or reject the  cases within 15 days.  At the top of it, if at all, there is a delay, reasons for the  same will have to recorded in writing.  It is a good move.  Further, Committee of  Creditors has been equipped with more rights.  There would be a single window  system to take care of the whole host of issues like restructuring, merger,  demerger, amalgamation etc.  The Government is supposed to formulate policies  and to provide conducive environment to the entrepreneurs enabling them to carry  out their function properly. Ours is the fastest growing economy in  the world.  Increase in NPAs of banks adversely affects development.  The  Government has brought this law to deal with this problem.  Hopefully this will  yield good results.  94 cases have been resolved under the Corporate Insolvency  Resolution Process till 31st March, 2019.  This is good that insolvency resolution  ranking of India for 2014 has improved from 134 to 108. I support the Bill. I slightly  disagree on suggestion of arbitration by a High Court Judge as they are already  overworked and the term \\'eminent person\\' is so vague. \\'Eminent person\\' is a very  relative term. I think there should be no ambiguity ever and no misuse of it.  The  qualification, experience and norms of accreditation of arbitrators shall be such as  specified in the Eighth Schedule. Provided the Eighth Schedule shall be deemed to  have been amended accordingly and Parliament really shall have no role once you  change it. Minister should clarify it for record. There are 3,28,000 cases pending in  arbitration. This could reduce litigation to a large extent. If you do want to do this  for ease of business, I think in a country like us we need it. In past we have lost  foreign investment due to litigations. I think this is a great intervention. The Arbitration Act, 1996 was amended by the  Act of 2015 to make the arbitration process smooth.  Therefore, the Government in  order to identify the road blocks in the development of arbitration institutions,  under the Bill of 2009 makes provision for Arbitration Council.  By making the  council ’body corporate’ it raises certain queries about its nature.  Under it,  international persons will also become arbitrators.  Subject to the fact that there  should be no conflict of interest, parties could decide whoever they want as  arbitrators .  There certainly is a need to institutionalize the entire arbitration set up  in India.  Therefore, I support the Bill in its entirety. Government has been duly appreciated and duly  thanked for various landmark reforms.  The Government is working towards  establishing a settled law when it comes to the bankruptcy process.  The  governance is achieved when the rules are clear.   It is the job of the Government  to make the rules clear for the various players in the industry, in the economy, so  that everybody can conduct themselves accordingly. The Insolvency and  Bankruptcy Code has already been very successful. We have already seen 101  cases that have been withdrawn, 120 cases that have been resolved and 475 cases  that have been taken into liquidation.  So, the Code is working very well.  It will  enable us to meet our philosophy of ‘minimum government, maximum  governance’.  A very important aspect of this Bill is introducing many other  possibilities that were not allowed earlier such as mergers, amalgamations and de- mergers.  That will make this Bill work much more efficiently and take our  economy to 10 trillion. The names of legislations have changed,  decades have gone by and the entire Government machinery has been put to stop  this menace of NPAs, but not been able to contain this issue of rising NPAs.  You  have genuine business failure on the one hand and willful defaulters and malicious  failures on the other hand.  We need to differentiate these two.  In this whole  process, banks and lenders also have a very important role to play.  I believe that  the accountability with the banks needs to be much higher.  They have to do their  own survey and look at the state of the economy.  If banks are giving loans without  evaluating all of these factors, the NPAs will continue to go up.  If we do not  distinguish between genuine business failure and willful default, we will lose our  ability to innovate as a country and ultimately it will affect our growth.  I suggest  for consideration of the hon. Minister to provide one last opportunity to the debtor,  because our ultimate objective is to turn the business around and keep it running  and not to close the business.  Kindly look at this.  With these observations, I  support this Bill. I have risen here to support this  Bill.  The proposed amendments about porn are necessary.  Now, all children keep  mobile phones in their hands. The mobile phones have got numerous benefits but  they are equally harmful also.  Therefore, it was necessary to bring a stringent law  on pornography and it was also required to define it.  Last week, the Hon. Supreme  Court said that special Courts should be set up in each district for the disposal of  POCSO cases.  Last year, as many as 33,000 cases were registered in the country.   The Government is trying to purge the culture of the country through this Bill. I rise to support the Bill. Hon. Minister  deserves all laurels for bringing a comprehensive amendment to the Act.  One of  the new developments in this area is cyber world offences.  It is heartening to  know that ‘child pornography’ has been given a comprehensive definition, and it is  expected to take care of new challenges that we confront.  One aspect of the matter  deserves some kind of consideration. We have shifted this from “communal or  sectarian violence” to “violence or during any natural calamity”.  Who will decide  this “….. in similar situations”?  What is the ‘situation’? We leave too much to the  Trial Judge. This again needs to be considered.  These offences are mostly  committed in the child care institutions. The hon. Minister has to come out with a  comprehensive policy to shift attention from institutional care to non-institutional  care or alternative care so that less and less children are sent to these institutions.   You cannot divorce it from the POCSO Act and the Juvenile Justice Act because  these are parts of the same thing. We have to evolve a holistic approach.  My  request to the hon. Minister is that we should strengthen the preventive  mechanism.  I want some kind of death sentence of a very, very aggravated form  so that the life of the child is saved.  I would like to thank the Hon. Minister for  bringing this Bill on such a sensitive issue in the Parliament.  Several discussions  are taking place on Section 6 of the Principal Act in which there is an amendment  of death penalty and I wonder, why death penalty should not be there. In this  regard, the government deserves to be congratulated for showing so much of will  power to bring the provision of death penalty in the Act. I have a suggestion that  provisions should also be made in the Act against the persons committing  organized crime against the children. Unless the mindset of the society undergoes a  change, no law will become more successful. However, there is a need to bring  awareness and launch a campaign in the society that the children have to become a  good citizen in this country. We will be able to do something when their mindset is  healthy. Therefore, I would urge the Parliament to pass it. I will have a small  suggestion for the amendment. Section-1 and 2 of the Principal Act-3 in case of  amendment of Section-4, should be substituted because in my opinion you will  have to change it if not today then tomorrow. If it is amended it would be better  because if this problem is resolved as to how much money should be given to the  victim, the introduction of this Bill will become meaningful. First of all, I would like to  congratulate hon\\'ble Prime Minister and Minister of Women and Child  Development for introducing such sensitive matter with consensus.  All of us say  that there is a need to change the mindset of society, but it is necessary that we  should start this change with ourselves. When such issues are debated then all of us  want women to talk. Should it necessarily be a matter related to women?  I think  men should also raise such issues. Unless we change our mindset we cannot put  any good example in society. Rehabilitation of victim should certainly be  considered.  May we take certain initiative so that NGOs or Volunteers help  children to bring back their mental balance?  There should certainly be provision  for this purpose.  POCSO needs to be  implemented swiftly and also keeping in mind the sensitivity and care of survivors.   I have a few suggestions to the hon. Minister through you that a Child psychiatrist\\'s  presence has to be made mandatory during each investigation to aid and advice  especially in cases of female victims, the questioning should be done under female  supervision.  Offenders are punished once but the victims are punished repeatedly  during the course of interrogation.  I support this Bill whole-heartedly. The demand for such a Bill was being  made for long time in the country.  First Nithari incident took place and thereafter  followed the Nirbhaya incident.  Sexual predators do not consider the age of  children and sexual crime against children of one to three years are also  committed.  I would like to congratulate the hon. Minister for introducing charges   in POCSO Act of 2012 and making provision of capital punishment therein.  This  Bill is certainly an important step to check the increasing incidents of sexual crime  against children.  I would like to congratulate the hon. Minister for setting up 1023  special fast track courts.  But safety of witnesses should also be taken care of. I support this Bill.  Today punishment of death penalty has been pronounced within 8 months of a rape  and murder case of 3 years 7 months old girl child under the POCSO Act.  This is  perhaps the first instance after the Act was enacted in the year 2012.  I welcome  the provision of 10 years of imprisonment to curb the menace of child pornography  and misuse of children for it, which was only seven years earlier.  I also welcome  the provision of 20 years of imprisonment for committing the crime of penetrative  sex against children below the age of 16 years.  The payment of compensation  should be made as soon as possible so that the children can get treatment.   Provision of psychological counselling should also be made.   I support the POCSO (Amendment) Bill.   This Bill increases the punishment for offenders which is justified.  I request the  Hon. Minister that nothing less than the death penalty should be awarded in case of  any sexual assault or unnatural act on a child less than the age  of 15 years.   This  Bill has also increased the punishment for using children for pornography.  Possessing any material related to child pornography should also be brought under  the category of offence.  A  law in this regard should be framed in our country also  as many other countries have a provision of 10 years imprisonment for possessing  such material. I rise to support Arbitration and Conciliation  (Amendment) Bill, 2019. The objective of this Bill is to provide fair and  transparent judicial system for the civil and commercial disputes outside the  Courts. India is a big market and the difficulties related to trade have decreased.  The economy of the country is consistently growing at rapid speed, therefore it has  become the centre of attraction. In view of the above there is a need of Modern  Dispute Redressal Law. 95 per cent of commercial disputes are being settled  through arbitration in the developed countries in the entire world. The Law  Minister with his utmost dedication made efforts to dispose of the cases of civil  and commercial nature and to make India an arbitration hub in the world in the  field of disposing of international trade disputes. The real objective of this Bill is  the appointment of arbitrators and the establishment of Indian Arbitration Council.  Recently, one hon. Member had discussed about the pending cases in the Courts in  India, therefore in present scenario these laws are needed. She had mentioned  about more than three crore cases. Out of these three crore cases 46 per cent cases  are such wherein Government Departments and Government Corporations are up  against each other. If we successfully settle those cases, the figure of three crore  would come down to one and a half crore. This Act would definitely enable the  creation of such structure of arbitration, which will reduce the dependency on court  and decrease the differences as well and will create a trade and development  friendly environment. Due to these effects this Act would prove a mile stone,  which would settle the domestic as well as international disputes as a result of  which India would become an international centre. Disputes relating to sharing of river water have  been going on in the country since the last 60-70 years.  The Article 262 clearly  states that the Parliament may by law provide for the adjudication of any dispute or  complaint with respect to the use, distribution or control of the waters of, or in, any  inter-State river or river valley.  Therefore, there shouldn\\'t be any doubt that the  Government of India has no power to enact law on this subject.  There are about 20  big state basins of rivers in the country.  Our experience has been that the tribunals  have neither passed any award for many years nor any time limit relating to them  has been prescribed.  Earlier, all the tribunals had judicial members.  This time, the  Bill proposes that it will have judicial members as well as expert members also,  who will be of the level of chief engineer with experience of working on river  water disputes.  This is happening for the first time.  It is the need of the hour that  we constitute a permanent Tribunal so that the ever increasing number of inter- state river water disputes could be checked.  Further, I would like to ask the hon.  Minister whether the Government will review the Indus Water Treaty signed  between India and Pakistan in 1960 so that our country gets justice. This public property eviction law  was made in 1971 and it was brought again in 2017.  Today, it has been brought  again here and for that, I would like to thank honourable Minister.  Government  assets are for the execution of social obligations.  Through the amended law, it will  be possible for the new allottees to receive the government facility quickly. There  are many types of government assets in the country.  But, it is seen that people  illegally possess these assets for many years and it makes significant loss to the  revenue of the Government. My Parliamentary Constituency is Palghar.  The  population of that area has increased upto around 20 lakh. The city, Vasai-Virar  near Mumbai is also known as third Mumbai city. Illegal works are being done in  many places which are under Government control. We have to protect the  Government land.  So, I support this Bill. The unauthorized occupants in  the government accommodations are required to be evicted as per the provisions of  PPE Act, 1971.  This process generally takes very long time.  So, there was urgent  need for such an Act.  Hence, due to absence of any such Act, people stayed in the  government accommodations in unauthorized capacity and used to go to court in  case of getting notice from Estate officer.  These cases take very long time and  people continue their unauthorized stay in government accommodations.  There are  a number of merits in this Bill.  Unauthorized stay of people in government  accommodations also results in loss of revenue for the government.  The  government has to pay allowance to those who have not been allotted government  accommodations.  There are also cases of misuse of government accommodation  in Bihar.  But the present government has taken back these accommodations and  has used it for opening schools for the dalits and underprivileged people. I  rise to  support this Bill. Now, the  markets have become advanced as a result of which certain evils have also crept in  along with many good things.  Sometimes, the consumers are cheated.  This Bill  provides for a Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA). Earlier, district  forums were entitled to try the disputes of value of upto Rs. 20 lakh. Now, this  limit has been enhanced to Rs. 1 crore.  This Bill has a provision of mediation also.   The sellers should mandatorily give a bill for the sale and the goods can be  returned within a period of 1 month.  All the market committees and government  godowns should be equipped with electronic weighing machines for the benefit of  farmers. I rise to support this Bill. This Bill  has a new provision of class action suit. There is a provision of mediation also in  the Bill. E-commerce policy and Consumer Protection Bill are in conflict with each  other. I would like to know as to what will be the qualification of the judges.  Earlier, the forums at district level were entitled to try the disputes of value upto  Rs. 20 lakh.  It\\'s good that now this limit has been enhanced to Rs. 1 crore. I rise to support the Consumer Protection Bill,  2019.  The object of this Bill is to protect the interests of the consumers.  The  entitlement of different consumer forums has been enhanced.  Besides, provision  of mediation as well as facility of registering online complaints is also there.  Now  many people are  using e-commerce.  This is also a big challenge before us.  This  Bill proposes to establish a Central Consumer Authority which will help us stop  unethical trade practices.  This Bill provides that in case a consumer gets a  favourable verdict from a district forum or the State Commission, the opponent  company does not have a choice to move the National Commission.  This Bill  provides the facility of hearing through video conferencing as well.  The  Government should address the issue of MRP also. I would definitely like to say that  this particular Bill if implemented well, will be a game-changer for consumers and  consumers interests in our country.  There are three major goals of this Bill. One is  to prevent violation of consumer rights, two is to check illegal trade practice, to  check illegal business ethics and the last one is to prevent misleading  advertisements.  We have been talking about different kinds of marketing,  misleading advertisements, tele-marketing, multi-level marketing, direct selling  and e-commerce pose new challenges to the consumers.  So, there is the need for  this kind of a Bill.  About 4,61,000 cases await disposal.  This is extremely  unfortunate.  So, we need quick disposal of cases. The Bill provides for several  provisions for simplifying the consumer dispute adjudication process.  This Bill is  very much pro-consumer.  We are talking of ease in filing.  The e-filing is there.   The mediation and product liability is there.  We all need to work together. This  comprehensive Bill is very much in the interest of consumers. On my own behalf and of my  Party, I sincerely thank the Government especially the Minister of Labour, Santosh  Gangwar for the Labour codes, 2019. You have taken a very big bold step. None of  the political party in power showed courage to change an old law which was  already in use before the independence. But, this Government has changed this old  law from the time of independence. This law used to comprise of 44 laws in the  code of conduct for Labour. Now, these laws will be merged into 4 codes. By  constituting the Advisory Board, the Government has fixed the wage of labourers  which is a good step for the welfare of the labourers. The best part of this Act is  that it has the provision to increase the employment opportunities for women and  the safety of women. There are about 40 to 42 crores of labourers in the  unorganized sector of the country.  To protect the interest of the labourers in  unorganized sector is a big challenge for the Government and all of us. You have  brought this effective law which will definitely benefit the labourers in  unorganized sector. Women also work in unorganized sector. There is a need to  make a provision for their safety. If someone violates the formula brought by you,  there should be strict provision for that. If the provision is weak then the employers  will escape by giving low wages. Therefore, strict action should be taken and there  should be a provision for punishment in that.  If there are less than 10 number of  employed labourers in an institution, the provision for them is not given in this  code. Small companies will try to employ seven to eight labourers and the rest as  contract labourers. You should take note of it. Finally, I would say that me and my  Party support the Labour Code, 2019 brought by you. The mechanism for fixing minimum  wages for workers is very complex in the country.  Even the workers are not aware  about the exact minimum wages fixed for them.  There is provision in the Bill to  restrict the kind component of wages maximum upto 15 per cent for workers  engaged in the plantation sector.  This is a historic step.  A number of minute  changes have been made in the new Code on Wages.  The issue of gender  discrimination has been addressed in this code.  Earlier, the workers had to  approach multiple authorities in case of non-payment of minimum wages.   Provision of single window mechanism has been introduced in this code on wages.   Provision for appellate authority has also been made in it.  The existing mechanism  for inspection is also very bad.  Provision for web based inspection has been made  therein.  I hope that through this Code on Wages workers will be benefitted and  there will be change in their lives. I congratulate the Hon. Minister for bringing this  Bill.  The Code on Wages Bill would abolish  the exploitative  labour laws of  British era and will lay foundation for a new India.  This Bill would be helpful in  ensuring ease of doing business and will give momentum to  Make in India  Programme also.   The most important point is that this Bill ensures minimum  wages to the workers employed in organized and unorganized sectors across the  country.   This Bill will increase the legislative protection of minimum wages from  existing 40% to 100% work force. A simplified wage code has been prepared by  subsuming the existing four Acts - the Payment of wages Act, the Minimum  Wages Act, the Payment of Bonus Act and the Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 into  this one.  I would like to mention about my Parliamentary Constituency that tea  gardens in this area are facing lot of problems. Tea gardens are on the verge of  closure and the condition of the workers employed in these gardens is very pathetic  though Minimum Wage Act is implemented here.  There is  a need to change  the  PLA Act, 1951 also. The Code on Wages Bill is a historical bill which would  ensure minimum wages and  timely payment of wages  to 50 crore labourers across  the country and will also ensure ease of living while promoting ease of doing  business.  This Bill would help in abolishing gender discrimination in the country.      *SHRI THOL THIRUMAAVALAVAN: This Code is aimed at  amalgamating four old labour laws into one.  Although I welcome this Code being  brought with a good intention and aim keeping in view the interests of the  labourers and to fix the minimum wage on the basis of a law, I wish to register my  concern that this is a move aimed to help the corporate and international                                                              * Original in Tamil  companies.  The Government has fixed the time period for revision of minimum  wages once in five years.  But this Bill remains silent about revision of floor wage  and the period of such a revision.  As this Bill is affecting the interests of the  labourers and workers of the country.  I request to send this Bill for the review  and  consideration of the Standing Committee. This is a very important Bill.  It aims at  bringing about massive improvement in the medical sector.  Shortage of qualified  doctors is an issue of grave concern.  It seems pertinent to mention in this context  that a good number of specialists are being appointed in each Sadar hospital at the  district level.  Thanks to the initiatives undertaken by the Government of Bihar in  order that all sorts of medical facilities may be available in the rural areas itself.   With the passing of the National Medical Commission Bill, I am sure there would  be qualitative changes in the field of medical education in terms of transparency,  accountability and of course in the monitoring of medical education in the country.   A host of initiatives have been made by the Government to increase the number of  seats in various medical educational institution/medical colleges.  The conduct of  final MBBS exams of all the medical colleges simultaneously and the provision  of  NEXT is a laudable step.  This will facilitate the students and they will not be  required to take the PG Admission Test separately.  Due to unavailability of any  direct train from my Parliamentary Constituency Gopalganj people are compelled  to journey by train to the metropolitan cities in pursuit of their treatment.  If a  medical college is set up at Gopalganj district in North Bihar, this will go a long  way in providing proper healthcare facility to those living in the rural areas of the  district.  Finally, I support the Bill.   This Bill is a very important Bill  because it is going to replace the Medical Council of India and a new National  Commission is being set up to improve the medical education in our country.  The  Bill also proposes to create four autonomous boards, which is a clear demarcation  of functions to regulate various aspect of medical education.  This would bring in  more transparency in selection process of Chairperson, Secretary and part time  members.  I would request the hon. Minister to clarify about the entrance exam to  what criterion will be there.  I would request the Minister that the practical exam  should not be taken in the same institute where the student is studying.  There  should be a completely transparent process so that there does not exist any chance  of bias. The amendments  proposed to the Company Law seek to tighten corporate social responsibility  compliance and reduce the load of cases on National Company Law Tribunal.  The  proposed legislation is intended to address the difficulties faced by stakeholders  and ease of doing business in order to promote growth and employment.  In the  interest of transparency and fairness, guiding principles for determination of  penalties have been introduced, which would help the companies to a large extent.   It is hoped that the change in the provisions of the Act will bring about a change in  the way the corporate world works.  Apart from that, under the amended law, non- maintenance of registered office and non-reporting of commencement of business  would be the grounds for striking off the name of a company from a register.  The  amendments are aimed at filling critical gaps in the Corporate Governance and  Compliance Framework as well as simultaneously extended great ease of doing  business to law-abiding corporates. Elections in our country commenced in the  year 1952.  We have been observing elections since the election to the first Lok  Sabha in the country that voting percentage has been very low.  For the first time,  in the recent elections, the voting percentage has gone upto 65 to 70 per cent which  has never been the case in the last many years.  This became possible because of  good election management by the Election Commission.  In my parliamentary  constituency of Jhalawar-Baran, we could reach upto  72 per cent voting for the  first time.  But here I need to say that if we make voting compulsory it would be an  infringement on our democratic rights. (Speech unfinished)  The discussion was not concluded.        SNEHLATA History is being created today  which would figure in golden letters in the annals of our Parliament. Hon. Supreme  Court has directed the Parliament in this matter twice in the past. Firstly, in Shah  Bano case and now in Shayara Bano case.  This is the difference of two  Governments.  This Government is competent enough to enact a law against the  triple talaq to give freedom to our sisters in the country after 72 years of  Independence.  A sincere effort is being made to give justice to all Muslim sisters  with a sense of duty, equity and equality.  Therefore, the Government deserves our  kudos.  Such a longstanding social evil needs to be removed through enactment of  law and not through society.  This was mandated by hon. Supreme Court and this  must be the duty of the politicians. The Government has decided to support  the Supreme Court Judgment through this Bill and this is an admirable cause. The  hon. Law Minister has pointed out that more than 200 cases have come even after  the Supreme Court’s Judgment which is really alarming.  It seeks to deter Muslim  husbands from whimsically divorcing their wives.  If passed, the Bill shall provide  equality to women that the Constitution of India mandates and the hon. Supreme  Court recommends. Marriage is a civil contract. We feel that divorce-related  offences under it should not be criminalized unless they can be linked to domestic  violence.  The Act of triple Talaq will result in imprisonment upto three years for  the husband, there is no clear provision as to how the incarcerated person will  provide maintenance to the wife.  The Bill should include a provision giving  women the option to ratify a marriage annulment and claim the maintenance under  this Bill.  Society today is moving towards decriminalizing certain things and  improving inter-personal relationships.  Section 377 has been decriminalized.  So,  let  us think beyond party lines and political agendas.     Muslim women have so far had no say in  the talaq-e-biddat practice of divorce in Muslim personal law. This Bill seeks to  change that, and I extend full credit to this Government for taking heed of the  issue.  All the Muslim countries have imposed ban on the practice of instant triple  Talaq.  The Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan conducted a national survey in  2015 and found that 92.1 per cent of Muslim women backed a total ban on oral or  unilateral divorce. It is now time for India to take this step.  I also support the  Government‘s effort to criminalize a void verbal statement because it sends a  message that a wife is not a disposable commodity.  We have to realize that this  practice is an easy bail out for all other evils too, such as dowry, domestic violence  or even infidelity.  This Bill is about women’s rights.  Do not make it about  religion.  I would exhort the Minister to launch nationwide campaign and spread  awareness about the practice of triple Talaq being null and void now for the  uneducated Muslim women. Marriage is a sacred institution.  By  entering into matrimonial alliance with a person, one is supposed to be with each  other through thick and thin.  The religion has to move forward in consonance with  the changing paradigm of society.  Social reforms have to be espoused to keep  progressing.  Prevention is always better than cure.  In a way, the provisions  contained in the Bill are of preventive nature.  So, we must support it.  This Bill  has been brought for the sake of upholding the esteem of women and gender  equality.  It is not that the incidents of triple talaq are witnessed only among the  illiterate gentry.  The fact remains that well educated women are also subjected to  this evil practice.  I am of the opinion that progress of women is a must for the  progress of the nation.  So, a law for equality is imperative.      I think all of us need to commend  the efforts of the Government and the hon. Prime Minister for having shown the  courage of come up with this king of Bill. This has been debated upon and the  suggestions that have been worthwhile have been incorporated. This Bill is a  logical culmination of the verdict given by the hon. Supreme Court in Shayara  Bano case on 22nd August, 2017. It very clearly held that talak-e-biddat violated  constitutional morality. It is definitely a non-bailable offence, but there is  conditional bail. Of course, there is the issue of allowance also. The Shah Bano  case would not have happened had this Act there at that point of time. Of course,  there is the issue of custody of children also. It is a great thing that the custody  issue has also brought in here. In this Parliament, there have been legislation  against dowry and sati, then what is the problem about this particular thing that we  are talking about. I would just like to make a remark. When men are oppressed, it  is a tragedy. But when women are oppressed, it is a tradition. This is not  acceptable. This is a historic moment for all  of us because this Bill will give Muslim women equality and a dignified life, which  is their well-deserved right. There are various laws as Section 3 of the Dowry  Prohibition Act, 1961, Section 498A of IPC and Section 17 of the Hindu Marriage  Act, 1956 which prescribe imprisonment of the Hindu men. You are crying for the  provision of imprisonment of the Muslim Men. It is a matter of oppression,  exploitation and injustice. It is a tool to deprive the crores of Muslim sisters of  their right to equality. The Muslim women need liberation not only from Triple  Talaq, but from crimes like polygamy and Halala also. The countries like Turkey,  Pakistan, Bangladesh, Syria, Iraq, Sudan and Libia have freed their women from  Triple Talaq. It is easy for anybody to just give up this issue, as has been done in  the past. Now, the Government led by Shri Narendra Modiji is committed to  discharge its duty. Five Muslim women including Ishrat Jahan are fighting against  the issue of Triple Talaq. Ishrat Jahan is from West Bengal. The Muslim men are  insulting Ishrat Jahan in West Bengal despite it is being ruled by a woman Chief  Minister.    We need to take stringent action  against the terrorists activities in the country.  This amendment Bill will strengthen  the National Investigation Agency which remains always vigilant for the security  of the country.  The previous Governments could not be so much successful in  containing the terrorism.  Those Governments brought a number of Acts like  MISA, TADA, MCOCA, POTA etc. but this Government has been successful in  its endeavour to curb terrorist activities.  It is the first time ever in the history of  this country that the Minister of Home Affairs was received with  open arms in  Jammu and Kashmir.  It is because people have faith in the Prime Minister and the  Minister of Home Affairs.  This amendment will help the authorities to confiscate  the property of a terrorist.  There were a number of channels through which  economic assistance was provided to the terrorists and there was an urgent need to  restrict the activities of such people.  There was a need to take legal action not only  against an organisation but also an individual.  This amendment Bill will help in  doing all these things.  My suggestion is that appropriate changes should be  brought about in the legal provisions to check the delay caused by the judicial  process. We must take all the necessary steps to  maintain the sovereignty and integrity of the country. Our Government believes in  the policy of zero tolerance. Stringent law must be there to arrest the culprits.  There is no ill will in this. The Bill has been brought only to simplify the  procedure. Amendments have been brought to strengthen the investigating  agencies. Terrorism is spreading its tentacles in all over the world. Today there are  so many countries in the world which are badly affected by terrorism.  This Bill is  in the interest of the country, therefore, I support this Bill. I rise to support this Bill.  We all should understand that this Bill is against the terrorists. Stringent laws  create fear in the minds of the criminals. Strict decisions of the Government have  resulted in mitigation of terrorist activities in the country. I support this Bill. It is a historic step to  stop corruption. As per CBI 68 thousand crore rupees have been collected from 6  crores of people in the country through illegal schemes. There are many provisions  to take action against such individuals but they escape because of loopholes in the  law. In this law, strict provision has been made.  Punishment and penalty has been  increased. In these schemes, mostly the poor people from villages fall into the trap.  Scams are done by bringing different schemes. The companies show such dreams  that the people fall into their trap. Through this Bill, illegal deposit schemes and  black money can be restricted to a large extent. The Government is constantly  working for the interests of the common people of the country. At the outset, I would like to thank the  Government for formulating a series of laws against terrorists, financial defaulters   and enemies of humanity.  I rise to support this Unlawful Activities (Prevention)  Amendment Bill.  Terrorism emanates from different sets of horrific ideology and  hence we need different laws to fight this menace.  Some of my colleagues raised a   question on the necessity of a stringent law.  For the reasons of the law being weak  in nature, such a milieu of fear and terror has engulfed this country that no one  feels safe today.  So, laws need to be framed commensurate with the gravity of  crime.  Those need to be proclaimed as terrorists who extend assistance, support  and finance to the terrorists.  Only by doing so we can stop the terrorists outfits  from spreading their tentacles.  This Bill provides for a definitive time frame for  the completion of the investigation of crimes related to terrorism.  The question is  whether we can bring in such a law that will ensure time bound trial even in court.   Terrorism being a national problem, it must be dealt with at the national  level. I rise to speak in favour of this Bill.  There are  hundreds of such examples in Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Maharashtra and  Karnataka where several families have been ruined.  The Reserve Bank of India  has said that it cannot regulate anybody apart from N.B.F.C. and banks. These  people always find out the escape route for every legislation. Security and  Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has submitted about Saradha Group in the year  2009 that it is a scam and it should be checked.  Thereafter SEBI has started  investigation into the matter and submitted its report to the Ministry of Corporate  Affairs in the year 2010 stating that it is a major scam and action should be taken  in this regard but nothing such happened.  The said Group had given motorcycles  to Kolkata Police under CSR.  If a Group has good relation with leaders and  bureaucrats then do you think that investigation into the matter will be conducted?   Similarly Rose Vally scam had also taken place in which an amount of Rs. 60,000  was involved. But I would like to state that the Government has presented the Bill  in view of all the above mentioned situations.  We have to consider the Bill rising  above our Party lines so that action should be taken against such scamsters and  these persons involved in it should be sent behind bars. I rise to support Motor Vehicles  (Amendment) Bill, 2019.  Motor Vehicles Act was enacted 30 years before and so  much changes have taken place during last 30 years.  Therefore, there was a need  to amend this Act.  Road connectivity, people\\'s safety, timely treatment, insurance,  compensation, simplification of transport related procedures and other things have  been kept in mind in this Bill.  Amendments have been made in this Bill in the  matters related to passengers, freight, operation, driving license, insurance etc.  So  many new provisions have been made in this Bill about security.  Road accidents  take place due to wrongly issued driving licenses. There is a loss of 3 per cent of  GDP every year due to road accidents.  Therefore, there is a need to control these  accidents.    It is very unfortunate that 1.5 lakh people die in  around 5 lakh road accidents that takes place in the country every year.  Various  other problems also existed in the transport industry.  People have to face various  difficulties in getting licence at RTO.  Now, under the able leadership of hon.  Prime Minister, this Government has strived hard to overcome this difficult  situation and it seems that India is scaling new heights to become a modern nation  in the fields of roads and transport by implementing innovative ideas and projects.   With a great pride, I can say that now it is possible to cover the distance between  my parliamentary area Karauli and Dholpur in one and a half hour only whereas  earlier it used to take 5 hours to cover the same.  Through this Bill, this  Government has provided for online registration and driving licence as a step  towards building a nation free from corruption.  This will also modernise the  process involved in issuing driving licence and vehicle registration in India.  Apart  from that, provisions have also been made under this Bill  to link Aadhaar card  with driving licence and vehicle registrations.  This will also eliminate the problem  of fake licences.  It is a very important Bill associated with the lives of the people  of this country.  This also shows that our Government is committed under the able  leadership of hon. Prime Minister.  Under this Bill, provisions have been made that  if a minor is caught driving the vehicle and is involved in any accident or violation  of any rule then his parents or the vehicle owner shall be held responsible for his  act. I rise to speak in support of the Motor  Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, 2019 which seeks to replace the Motor Vehicles  (Amendment) Act, 1988.  It contains several good provisions which will go a long  way in making India\\'s road safer.  I appreciate the provision of providing cashless  treatment to the road accident victims which will help in saving a lot of lives.  The  Government should take the State Governments also on board in its bid to  implement provisions of this Bill.  I want to ask the Government whether the  electronic monitoring of the road safety would be done on the National Highways,  State Highways or the urban roads.  The Government should also clarify as to who  is going to bear the cost of this electronic monitoring of the road safety: Is it the  Central Government or the State Government?  Moreover, the Road Safety Board  should have all the power  to look into the compliance, monitoring of the  compliance and levy penalties.    This amendment Bill is a good step   towards the road safety.  I would like to urge the Government that a stern action  should be taken against the officers issuing driving licence to an untrained person.   I would like to suggest the Government in this regard.  There should be a provision  for strict examination before issuing licence to the drivers and prior to it intensive  training should be ensured for them.  The act should have the provisions to punish  the contractors who are found guilty of showing laxity in the construction and  upkeeping of the roads. At the same time, the responsibility of higher officers  should also be fixed.  A world class Driver Training Institute should be set up in  every district keeping in view the shortage of drivers in our country.  The CSR  fund should be utilised for this purpose.  I would like to thank the Government for  promoting the use of non-conventional energy and at the same time getting people  rid of environment pollution by exempting electronic vehicles from taxes. In the first place, I, on behalf of my  party, welcome you with all my heart. It is a matter of pride that you will steer this  House for a period of five years occupying the chair of Hon. Speaker and all of us  will receive your invaluable guidance.  There are a number of parties in this House  with merely one, two or three Members and my party is no different on this count  that has only two elected Members.  The implication is that small parties like ours  need your protection the most in order that we may get ample opportunity to put  forward our views through you.  Hon. Prime Minister has elaborated on your  exposure to Parliamentary practice at length, I do not wish to reiterate the same.  I  am fully confident that the great legacy of our first hon. Speaker Shri G.V.  Mavlankar and the legacy of his successesors would be further strengthened in  your tenure.  Alongside, all of us would recieve an encouragement to strengthen  Parliamentary democracy by way of your guidance.  On behalf of my party, I  assure you to extend my whole-hearted support in the smooth conduct of the  business of the House. I just wish to witness an enhanced glory of this House in  your illustrious tenure. Whenever you sit on the Chair, we feel  proud.  Our Government has done so many things in the interest of the people and  the country.  Yesterday, portrait of late Atalji was inaugurated.   His memory has  been preserved forever in the Central Hall.  India is the largest democracy of the  world. We have to make this democracy more strong and for that the Opposition  and treasury benches will have to move ahead together.  You have given me and  all other Members the opportunity to express our opinion without any partiality. Some of the people suddenly get  hyperactive whenever the issue of chit fund or ponzi scheme is raised.  The entire  country is aware that the Left Front Government of the West Bengal brought in  this Bill to ban this scheme in 2002.  If the erstwhile Union Government had  acceded to that Bill, such a large number of persons would not have lost  their  money.  Therefore, I would like to support and thank the hon. Finance Minister for  bringing in this Bill.  I would like to make a demand that appropriate measures  should be taken to return the money to the poor people. The Hon. Speaker, Madam, gave me  opportunities to speak on behalf of my party on all issues. She conducted the  House in an orderly manner.  I congratulate and thank her for this.  I congratulate  the hon. Prime Minister also who gave the slogan, ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ and  ‘Corruption Free India’. I am in favour of this Bill.  The middle class  and the poor have been widely affected by such chit funds.  A Srijan scam has  taken place in our State which needs to be discussed.  This Bill brought in by the  hon. Minister is a welcome move. This Bill has been brought in with a view to  amending the Rules to Jallianwala Bagh Memorial Committee Trust.  It is not a  celebration.  When Sikhs were being subjected to assault way back in 1984, our  leader Bala Sahab had strictly warned not to hurt the Sikhs even to the least degree.   I welcome the Amendments moved by the Government.  Jallianwala Bagh is not  associated with any particular religion, faith or even a state for that matter.  This  episode inflicted pain across the country.  I support the Amendments moved  relating to the trustees of  Jallianwala Bagh Memorial Committee. It is a very difficult task to conduct  the business in the House.  But, you made successful attempt in running the House  in the best possible manner.  Hon. Prime Minister also made efforts to carry  everyone along.  Therefore, I congratulate him.  Everyone should participate in the  discussion in the House and everyone should also ensure that the House runs  smoothly.   This Parliament is a great institution.  I  congratulate our Hon. Prime Minister for the passage of various important Bills.   The job of the Speaker is very difficult.  I represent the Other Backward Castes of  India. I only hope today that in the next Lok Sabha and in the subsequent Lok  Sabhas, the voices of the marginalized section of society will be heard.  India has  seen a tremendous leader and a dynamic Prime Minister in Narendra Modi Ji and  we have more of him to see in future. During the last five years, our Government  has been implementing the policies for the benefit of the villages, the poor, the  farmers, the exploited, the downtrodden, the middle class and the students and this  budget is the ultimate compliment to these policies.  This discussion is on the  Finance Bill, however, my predecessor was speaking on budget.  Such irrelevant  discussions dent the image of politicians.  Yesterday, the Floor Leader of a party  was saying that the Government is not releasing the report on black money  whereas the fact is that the Members of the Finance Committee can access the said  report.  The Economic Survey of 2004 said that the Vajpayee Government had  given a robust economy to the country.  The Economic Survey of 2014 says that  the preceding Government had left the economy of the country in a bad shape.   The Congress Party is constantly quoting the name of HAL whereas this is only a  company.  When the Modi Government came to power, it immediately constituted  the SIT  on black money.  The reason for black money generation in the country  was that the rates of income tax used to be very high.  If we want to develop, we  have to make our country a tax paying country.  MSME Sector has got the  maximum benefits from this Finance Bill.  This is the first Government ever to  thank the tax payers.  The theory of \\'One Nation One Tax\\' is not a new theory but  we have got a Prime Minister for the first time who could implement this theory in  the form of GST.  This Finance Bill is going to benefit the middle-class, the poor  and the villages.  With these words, I support this Bill.  By allocating more Budget for 13 Ministries especially  related with public affairs under this Finance Bill 2019-20, the Government has  shown its farsightedness.  In this country, it has been tried to provide assistance to  12 crore farmers through Pradhan Mantri Samman Nidhi.  The Government has  provided soil health card and brought 22 crops for the first time under Minimum  Support Price and increased it by 50 to 90 per cent.  Shram Yogi Yojana has been  introduced under which when a labourer is rendered incapable after 60 years of  age, he/she will get a pension of at least Rs. 3000/-.  For the first time this  Government has paid attention towards the Development of rural infrastructure and  under Pradhan Mantri Sadak Yojana a budget of Rs.19 thousand crore has been  allocated by covering 98 percent of the small villages and dhanis.  Through Mudra  Scheme girls have been made self reliant without any capital security guarantee.   About 50 crore poor Indians were not able to get medical treatment.  Ayushman  Bharat Scheme is such a scheme of India in the world under which each poor will  get medical treatment.  The middle class will get a tax rebate of income upto Rs.5  lakh.  For the first time provision for providing reservation to economically weaker  sections of the upper caste has been made.  Entire India has got a new direction  through this Budget.  This Budget will prepare new infrastructure for the  development of this country and will uplift the poor people of lower class.   I congratulate the hon. Minister of  Finance for understanding the issues of the middle class salaried people and  providing them maximum relief. Hence forth, person having annual income upto  Rs. 5 lakh will be exempted from paying any tax. Approximately three crore  existing tax payers will be benefited by it. Standard deduction has been raised from  Rs. 40 thousand to Rs. 50 thousand. It is a commendable step. The abundance of  benefits notwithstanding the revenue generation through income tax is estimated to  be approximately Rs. 13 lakh 80 thousand crore by the year 2020. I thank the hon.  Prime Minister for the code of conduct of \\'Collective Efforts Inclusive Growth\\'  (Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas). The present Government is working  with a mission for the bright future of this country.  People from across the world  have come and taken a holy dip in the ongoing ‘Kumbh Mela’ and everyone is  saying that 80 percent water of the Ganga river has become pollution free.  Couple  of years earlier no one could ever imagine that the same Ganga would be flowing  uninterrupted and be pollution free.  Earlier yoga was not so popular but now the  world has accepted that Yoga is the contribution and a gift of India to the world.   The International Day of Yoga has been accepted by the whole world.  When this  Government came in power in 2014, the youth and farmers of the country were  feeling let down everywhere. There was feeling of desperation in people  everywhere.  But today India is being recognized worldwide.  The Government has  taken many steps like rolling out Swachch Bharat Mission, constructing toilets,  launching Jan-Dhan Yojana and opening medical colleges etc.  Earlier there were  just three medical colleges in my Parliamentary Constituency Jharkhand in the last  50-60 years but now 8 medical colleges have been opened within the span of four  years only.  Even AIIMS has been opened there.  Roads have been constructed in  every village under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana.  All this instilled a sense  of confidence in the farmers and the youth.  So, now India is going to be  prosperous in future and became world Guru once again. The budget of  our government under the leadership of the hon\\'ble Prime Minister is a growth  oriented budget. Central Government is going to implement \"Pradhan Mantri  Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana\" to provide annual financial assistance of Rs. 6,000/-  to the 12 crore farmers having landholding of up to two hectares. Income up to Rs.  5 lakh has been made tax free. Labourers in the unorganised sector would be  provided monthly pension of Rs. 3000/- after completing the age of 60, for which  they have to make contribution of Rs. 100 per month.

The budget of our Government is  based on the principle of \\'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas\\' and it is every person\\'s budget.  It is budget of the poor, young people, farmers, middle class, small traders. It is a  budget of more than 3.5 crore middle class families.

Maximum number of  soldiers in our Armed Force and Para Military Forces hails from my Parliamentary  Constituency, Jhunjhunu. For the first time ever the defence budget is crossing 3  lakh crore rupees. Almost each and every village of the country has been  connected with roads through Pradhan Mantri Grameen Sadak Yojana. Today poor  women are being provided with free Gas Connection under Ujjawala Yojana.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana is being started to provide high class free treatment to  poor.

When India celebrates its 75th  year of independence each and every one will have toilet facility, electricity, water  sewage connection and the farmers will have double income and it will be caste,  dynasty and terrorism free and an empowered country. We have reined in inflation.  We have brought in a radical change in the field of taxation by paving way for  Goods and Service Tax (GST). We have initiated a new era of transparency. We  have run a corruption free Government. The budget is going to prove a revolutionary  step for development and uplift of all sections of the society. The Pradhan Mantri  Kisan Sampada Yojana, one Rank-One-Pension Scheme for the defence personnel,  Skill Development Scheme and Khelo India for the youth are the major initiatives  of the Government. India has ranked 5th  in defence power with setting up 108  satellites in the space. I welcome these measures undertaken by the Government. The Government is moving forward to realise  the dream of \\'New India\\' by the year 2022. Our economy is the fastest growing  economy in the word and achieved highest growth rate in these 5 years since the  economic reforms started in 1991. Today, India is the 6th largest economy. The  Government has successfully achieved highest growth rate, controlled two digit  inflation and maintained fiscal balance. India has also attracted huge FDI  amounting nearly 239 billion USD during the last 5 years. Last 5 years have seen  the fast infrastructural reforms and have paved the path for higher growth rate for  many coming decades. I am happy to know that the 22th AIIMS is going to be set- up in Haryana. Targeted development works are being carried out in 115 most  backward districts under Aspirational District Programme. For the first time, the  MSP of all 22 crops was announced at least 50% more than their input cost. The  government is going to launch a historical programme named Pradhan Mantri  Kisan Samman Nidhi PM-Kisan with annual outlay of Rs. 75 thousand crore to  ensure certain fixed income for small and marginal farmers. The Government has  taken decision to set up a separate department for fishery. New Pension Scheme  has been more libralised by increasing the share of government from 10% to 14%  while retaining the employees\\' share of 10%. The minimum wage for all category  employees has also increased by 42%.  42 crore workers of the un-organised sector  contribute nearly 50% in the total GDP of the country. The Government has  proposed to initiate a comprehensive pension programme named Pradhan Mantri  Shram Yogi Maandhan for these workers of unorganised sector. The Government  has also proposed to set up a Welfare Development Board under Social Justice and  Empowerment Ministry with the aims to implement welfare and development  programmes meant for denotified, nomadic and semi-nomadic communities. More  than 1 crore youths are being trained under PM Kaushal Vikas Yojana so that they  may earn their livelihood. All these efforts have made India world\\'s second largest  start-up hub. The government has envisaged a national programme for Artificial  Intelligence and allied technologies so that its benefits reach masses. Many  effective measures have been taken to strengthen the small and medium  enterprises. The government has set up government e-market place two years ago.  The total transaction amounting Rs. 17,500 crore has been done through this GeM  and has resulted in average of savings of 25% to 28%. It is for the first time that  defence budget for 2019-20 is going to cross the Rs,3,00,000 crore. Now more than  100 airports are operational in the country. Domestic air traffic has grown two  times in the last 5 years. India has become fastest highways developer country in  the world. The railway passengers are getting world classes facilities with the  operation indigenously designed and manufactured semi-high speed train Vande- Bharat Express.

For the first time, Arunachal Pradesh has made its  place on civil aviation map and Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizorm on India\\'s railway  map. Now, India has become the largest data consumption country in the world.  The number of companies manufacturing mobile and mobile components has  increased from 2 to 268. The government has reduced the tax rate. The  implementation of GST of undoubtedly the biggest tax reform after independence.  The government in committed to wipeout the evil of black money. The  development in our government has transformed into mass movement. My  constituency Misrikh is one of the most backward areas in the country. It needs fast  development work. Last year also, I made a demand to construct an embankment  on the left bank on the river Ganga flowing from my constituency. There is a need  to construct ROBs and RUBs on all the unmanned level crossings there.   PROF. SAUGATA ROY: This year unemployment is at an all-time 45  years high, at 6.1 per cent.  National Sample Survey Organization data has not  been published.  The Government is not allowing them to publish the data on  unemployment which is at a very bad state.  Total Non-Performing Assets of the  banks have crossed rupees 11 and a half crore, an all-time high.  The Government  has not been able to bring back the people who fled with bank’s money.  The  Interim Finance Minister has presented an ‘Account for Votes’.  This is only a  vote-oriented Budget.  The Government has tried to apply ‘betadine’ to the wounds  created by demonetization.  Ultimately, the Government has not been able to bring  back black money into the system.  The Government has gone on changing the tax  rates as a result of which the GST collection this year is Rs. one lakh crore which  is less than  the previous budged.  The Andhra people have a justified demand for a  special category status, but that is not being listened to.  I would urge the  Government to announce something about it.  The Government has announced  Rs.6000 per year per family which comes to Rs.500 per month and Rs.17 per  family per day.  It is too little and too late.  Provident Fund-linked Pension Scheme  too does not sound promising at all. The Government has presented an  expansionary Budget and prioritized populism over fiscal prudence.  This Budget  is not showing any direction to the country.  The Government is not capable of  delivering a good economic system.  I oppose this Budget. I am thankful that you have given me the  opportunity to speak on the Interim Budget dedicated to \"Prosperous Farmer  Healthy India\". Our Government has been successful in checking the double digit  inflation. Our Government has introduced a scheme to provide minimum income  of Rs. 6000 per annum to provide relief to small and marginal farmers. Our  Government has recovered three lakh crores rupees from big defaulter companies.  Electricity will be provided to all the 2.5 crores houses till March 2019, which are  deprived of it. The work of Saubhagya scheme is almost complete. The  Government has announced to increase the limit of gratuity from 10 lakh rupees to  20 lakh rupees.  Rupees 3000 per month will be given to the employees of  unorganised sector. Undeclared income of 1.30 lakh crore rupees has been detected  through steps taken by the Government including demonetisation to check the evils  of black money. There is a proposal to double the income tax rebate by increasing  it upto five lakh rupees to provide relief to middle class people. Three crore middle  class taxpayers will be benefitted by this proposal. The farmers who are facing  natural calamities will be given two percent interest subsidy and the farmers who  are repaying the loan in time will be given three percent interest subsidy to  overcome the crises in agricultural sector. The Government will provide 750 crore  rupees to help animal husbandry and fisheries. The Minimum Support Price for 22  notified crops has been fixed 50 percent more than the input cost. The Government  has sanctioned 15.56 lakh loans of 7.23 lakh crores of rupees under Mudra Yojana  and a major part of its beneficiaries are women. Six crore gas connections have  already been provided to poor women out of eight crore free LPG connections  under Ujjwala Yojana. At present 100 airports are operational in the country and  the traffic has doubled during the last five years. India is at the forefront in the  world in developing the highways. All the unmanned level crossings have been  abolished. A national programme on artificial intelligence will be introduced to  provide the benefit of artificial intelligence and the related technology to the  people. India has become the  maximum mobile data user country in the world.  One lakh villages will be made digital during the next five years. I believe that  equal focus has been given to all the sectors from agriculture to the basic  infrastructure in this Budget. This budget is beneficial for farmers and the common  men. This Budget shall empower the  poor, strengthen the farmers, honour the labourers and fulfil the dreams of the  middle class.  This Budget will enhance the purchasing power of the middle class.   The IMF report of the year 2018 acknowledges India as the fastest growing  economy among the emerging economies of the world.  The global performance of  the country has increased and we have climbed to 71st position from 142nd position  in ease of doing business.

Our Government has, in the Interim Budget taken  care of every section of the country.  By providing relief to the farmers, labourers  and tax payers in the budget, our Government has opened new doors of  development for these people.  Prior to 2014 General Elections, the farmers, the  poor people, the labourers and the backward classes were struggling for their  existence and inflation had overburdened the common citizen.  In 2014 General  Elections, the people voted in favour of Bharatiya Janata Party Government and  showed faith in it regarding creation of a new India.  Our Government has stepped  up fast in the direction of fulfilling the dreams of new India.  Our Government, in  its tenure of four and a half years, prepared its schemes keeping in view every  section of the country and implemented it effectively.  Our Government has made  arrangement like housing, insurance, gas connection for the poor and Soil Health  Card for the farmers.  All facilities have been provided to the farmers, students,  people working in unorganised sector, housewives and people belonging to the  working class so as to ensure all-round development of the country.  The  Government has launched Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Scheme.

The Government has made announcement regarding  allocation of 60,000 crore rupees for MGNREGA. The Government will convert  one lakh villages into digital villages over the next five years.  During the last four  and a half years, our Government has run a corruption free Government which is  committed only for development of the country. The Government under the leadership of Shri  Narendra Modi has given free LPG connections to 6 crore families.  Now, it has  been announced in the Budget that 2 crore more families will be given free LPG  connections.  A  pension scheme has been announced  for 10 crore labourers  working in the unorganised sector .  The Government will deposit Rs.2000 in the  accounts of farmers directly before 31st March.

In this budget that interest of Rs.10,000 has been enhanced upto  Rs.40,000.  Reserve Bank has reduced .25 BPS interest rate.  It means that lakhs of  home buyers have been benefited.  In the end, I would like to say that this is the  only Government which fights for the poor.    This is a very progressive budget.  Many provisions have been made to make farmers prosperous. Farmers engaged in  animal husbandry and fisheries have been given three percent rebate on interest  rate. Small farmers having a land holding of five acre are going to be provided  with six thousand rupees per farmer as assistance. Provision for Pension to  Labourers from unorganised sector has been made. Army has been given a budget  of three lakh crore. Deen Dayal Upadhyay Jeevan Jyoti Yojana has been launched  to provide electricity to every household. Health Insurance cover of upto five lakhs  has been provided to every poor family under Ayushman Bharat Yojana. The Government formed in 2014  under the leadership of the hon. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is totally  corruption free.     The NDA Government has brought down inflation rate to 4.6, fiscal deficit  to 3.4 percent and made untiring efforts to encourage direct investment.    There was uneven distribution of land and property in the country and the  present Government has made efforts to do away with it.  Further, the Government  has brought rural poor and middle class under the Banking system.    The Government has focused on sanitation and allocated crores of rupees to  State Governments for construction of toilets in villages.  It has taken historical  decision to provide 10 percent reservation in Government jobs and educational  institutions for economically weaker sections in general category so that the people  may get justice.  Many measures have been taken to provide foodgrains at cheaper  rates to poor and middle class and huge gap between facilities of cities and villages  has been narrowed.      This Government is farmer friendly and working towards doubling of their  income and launching certain schemes for them.  It has taken care of health  facilities for the people of the country and done considerable work in the field of  animal husbandry, fisheries and dairy sector.  Also, it has taken care of farmers,  fishermen, labourers, businessmen, industrialists and people related to rural  business.  I support the interim budget of 2019-20. This is a budget for new India. For  one Rank One Pension Scheme Rupees 35 thousand crore have been allocated. A  new department for fisheries has been opened. Provision of providing Rupees three  thousand as pension labourer of unorganised sector after 60 years of age has been  made. 10 percent reservation to the poors from upper castes has been provided.

The Interim Budget 2019-20 has  adequately    focused on the progress and growth of the people. This budget will help in the  years to come to make a new India. In this budget measures have been initiated for  the balanced development of the Country. The Government has for the first time  constituted Navin Kalyan Vikas board for the welfare of nomadic tribes. Various  schemes like Ujjwala Yojana, Mudra Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Matri Vandana  Yojana etc. have been initiated for the Welfare of women in the country. Under  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana all margined farmers holding two  acres of land will be provided 6000/- rupees each year.

This Government has brought a new ray of  hope in the lives of poor people by providing 10% reservation in educational  institutions and jobs to economically weaker people.  About 12 crore small and  marginal farmers of our country used to face money crunch to purchase seeds and  fertilizers at the time of sowing.  Now with the launch of Pradhan Mantri Kisan  Samman Nidhi Yojna our farmers will no longer require to struggle for  procurement of seeds and fertilizers during three cycles of sowing seasons and they  will not get trapped into moneylenders\\' net.   The Government has taken a  historical decision in the budget to set up Rashtriya Kamdhenu Aayog for genetic  upgradation of bovine resources to enhance the milk productivity of cows. Besides,  a provision of Rs.750 crores has also been made for \\'Rashtriya Gokul Mission\\'.  In  addition to it the sharecroppers should also be provided financial assistance from  the Calamity Relief Fund alongwith the farmers who get the benefit of crop  insurance in the event of natural calamity. I support this Budget  which ensures the development of the country for the next 10 years. This Interim  Budget is not the full Budget. The Budget which will be presented after the  Elections will be such which will usher in Acche Din and Sabka Saath Sabka  Vikas. With the announcement of providing more financial benefits to the soldiers,  the feeling of honour among soldiers has increased. Alongwith rebate in income  tax, the Budget has provided many things to the common man.

India is  considered to be the first front runners with regard to the use of mobile data. I hope that the objectives of  social inclusion, growth in jobs and most importantly farmer welfare are ultimately  achieved.  I would like to thank the Government for the Pradhan Mantri Kisan  Samman Nidhi Scheme wherein a sum of Rs. 6000 would be deposited directly in  the farmers’ bank account every year.  More than 12.5 crores farmers will benefit  from this.  Similarly, the Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maandhan assures a monthly  pension of Rs. 3000 for workers in the unorganized sector.  Special trust should be  paid for rural road development under Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana.  The  Hon.

In this Budget  an emphasis has been given to technological development, creation of digital  infrastructure and digitalization of governance.  A healthy allocation of Rs. 3 L  crore towards Defence can transform India’s defence preparedness and secure our  long term strategic interests.  Overall, this has been an expansionary Budget with  an equal emphasis on all strata’s of the society. Our Prime Minister has given a  stable and transparent Government to the country through his farsightedness and  able leadership.  This Government has started working towards making “New  India” by 2022 which is free from terrorism, communalism, castism, corruption  and discrimination.  Today we have become a sixth largest economy of the world.

Large number of power  connection have been provided under Saubhagya Yojana in my Parliamentary  Constituency Sidhi. I distribute gas under Ujjwala in almost my every programme.

Under Pradhan Mantri Kisan  Samman Nidhi, 6000 rupees per year for each farmer in three installments, this  initiative is likely to benefit 12 crore small and marginal farmers. Hon. Finance Minister has  presented a historic budget which is welfare and development oriented facilitating  India to emerge as a superpower at the global stage.  The world bank has said that  India will be one of the fastest growing economy of the world with the growth rate  of 7.5 per cent.  The report of the Development Centre of Harvard University has  also revealed that Indian Economy will be at the pinnacle of fastest growing  economy of the world in the coming decade.  I would like to congratulate the hon.  Prime Minister that we have become number one country of the world leaving the  USA behind in respect of FDI.  Today, India has emerged as the largest hub of  investment in the entire world.  Besides, we have jumped from 142nd to 77th  position in the Ease of Doing Business Index.  The number of tax payers has gone  up from 1.3 crore to 7.6 crore after the implementation of the GST.  The efforts are  being made to double the income of farmers by the year 2022.  For the first time,  11 crore farmers and vendors will avail of the facilities of online marketing  platform in the year 2018-19 and 1.27 crore farmers are likely to be benefitted  directly from this move. It is a matter of pride that our country is on the  path of development. Pending projects have been completed by the government.  There has been decline in the rate of inflation. Huge investments have been made  by foreign institutions. The government has worked for all the sections of the  society. Monthly GST collection has reached the level of approximately one lakh  crore rupees, which is one of the major achievements of this government.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana has created sense of security and confidence in crores of  families. Farmers have been benefitted greatly by measures like raising MSP one  and a half times, increasing the coverage of crop insurance to every household,  Neem coating of urea and making provision of assured annual financial assistance  to 12 crore farmer families. Every citizen of this country has been benefitted from  the development schemes in this interim Budget. The newly invention PM- Kisan Yojana is direct cash transfer to the farmer.  So the income support scheme  to farmers is good and no one will oppose it. We are all proud about Chandrayaan  and the hundred satellites launched with just one rocket. But madam how it is  helping the farmers in India? But none of the fisherman I able to use this data for  fishing. The single biggest worry is the jobless youth. Unemployment has actually  increased. On solar energy things went horrible wrong our policies were not right.  Many power producers as well as solar PV panel manufactures became bankrupt.  However, I am very glad about the recent plan of the government to put a mega  solar PV plant in Ladakh. We are happy at last the tribal university is allocated. It is indeed a wholesome budget taking care of  each and every section of society. Be it a major relief for taxpayers of nation or  income support to farmers through PM-KISAN, development of women,  empowering of youth, enhancement in Asha Yojana and Aanganwadi honorarium  by 50% or strengthening of defence and National Security, the budget took into  account all aspects for nation\\'s development. Jandhan Yojana, inflation control and  UDAN are the success stories of the government. The government has announced  a scheme to provide Rs. 6000 annually to each and every small and marginal  farmer. Modiji himself belongs to a poor family, so he knows how poverty can be  alleviated. Modiji initiated many economic reforms to bail out fragile Indian  economy and a number of steps have been taken to improve the condition of the  poor. This government provided 8 crore free LPG connections to poor households  during the last 4 years. Ayushman Bharat is another example. Poor persons can  avail insurance cover by paying premium of only Rs. 12 annually. Inflation rate  was as low as 4% in 2018 during the NDA regime. The government has not only  controlled the price, but also has increased MSP by 150%. Shri Swaminathan has  also appreciated this scheme. This Prime Minister\\'s attitude is nation should be first  in priority and not his family members. I am grateful to the Finance Minister for his  visionary ideas. The Union Budget has also reflected the Government\\'s objectives  of comprehensive development of each and every section of the society. The  Government has been able to infuse new hope and confidence among the people of  the Country. Shri Narendra Modiji has been made all out effort to improve the life  of every Indian. Schemes like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Ujjawala Yojana,  Ayushman Bharat Yojana for free treatment, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana,  Pradhan Mantri Soubhagya Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana will definitely  transform the destiny of the poor and the needy. The Social Security Schemes  announced in the Budget by the Government for uplifting the poor is a  commendable step. Shri Piyush Goyalji has presented a very pragmatic and people  friendly Budget that will benefit every section of the Society. The first and foremost important  individual is the farmer.  It is only when we can empower the farmer and the  agriculture sector, India will emerge stronger.  The Government has been  relentlessly working towards strengthening farmers and one such initiative through  this Budget is Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi.  Under this scheme farmers  holding up to 2 hectare of land will be given Rs.6000 per annum.  The number of  farmers who will get this benefit is huge.  This is the first time ever that any  Government has brought in the ambit of the budget the concerns of the  unorganised sector.   Budget 2019 has announced a mega pension scheme for  unorganised sector worker to provide assured pension of Rs.3000 rupees per month  to nearly 10 core people.  Those earning upto Rs.5 lakh a year will get full tax  rebate.  The Government has undertaken many effective steps to strengthen MSME  sector, which provides employment to crores of people.    \\'Housing for all\\' is a  priority for the Government.  And as per Budget 2019, as many as 1.53 crore  houses have been constructed under the flagship housing scheme Pradhan Mantri  Awas Yojana both in urban and rural segments.    A total of 28531 km national  highways were constructed since FY 2014-15, contrasting with 16505 km by the  UPA government up to FY 2013-14.  This is the commitment of our Government  towards infrastructure. Availing treatment free of cost under the Ayushman Bharat  has helped around 10 lakh people since its launch in September this year.  I would  like to congratulate our Hon\\'ble Finance Minister for presenting such a reformist  budget which addresses the concerns of almost all sections of the society. I rise to support the Hon. President‟s  Address.  India in 2087 will be the world‟s biggest democracy.  It will also  overtake China to be the world‟s most populous country.

By introducing „Ujjwala Yojana‟ people are  benefitted a lot which is remarkable.  By introducing Ayushman Bharat Yojna,  now people are getting the benefit.  I hereby request the Government that it should  be extended to the people who are poor but left out from the survey.  Congress  regime did not care for the people who were deprived from getting power.  We the  people of Assam are very much happy that the Government conferred Bharat  Ratna on the Late Dr. Bhupen Hazarika.  The people of North East especially from  Assam thank the Hon.

The present Government has made an effort to make Gandhiji\\'s idea turn into  reality through its programmes and works. When the Government started thinking  in terms of well-being of poor middle class, it carried out cleanliness campaign  followed by providing toilets in each house and bringing it forward, it made an  effort to provide better and cheaper health facility by reducing the costs on  medicines through Jan Aushadi Kendras. When the Government started \"Ujjwala  Yojana\" our poor sister living in village got rid of the problems being faced while  cooking for the family. All these works are on the verge of completion within  scheduled time. Today, the whole opposition is misleading by showing the unity.  In such a situation, I believe that the people of the country will appreciate the  works done by the present Government. I support this motion in the House.  Our Government has performed on the ground. More than 4900 Jan Aushadhi  Kendras have been opened in more than 600 districts across the country.

The  President\\'s Address rightly mentions that we were sensitive to the needs of countless  helpless people.  After providing for ten per cent reservation to the economically backward  people our Government has presented a very popular budget. The President‟s Address spelt out the  road map of the Government for the development of the country.  The BJP  Government has taken several measures for all round development of the country.   In order to make education available to all sections of the people of the country,  the Government has introduced SWAYAM.  The Government has amended the  Apprenticeship Act for enhancing the skills of youth and make them employable.

Our NDA Government  has taken a very comprehensive step to introduce Healthcare policy of the country.   The Government has taken steps to set up a separate ministry for the Fisheries.   The public investment in agriculture and rural development has increased to meet  the demands of the sector.  NDA Government led by our dynamic leader Shri  Narendra Modi ji has kept the promise of increasing MSP for farmers. Special  emphasis has been given to the alternate dispute resolution mechanisms. I would like to congratulate the  Government on its commendable economy success.  We are now one of the fastest  growing economies in the world.  In the Ease of Doing Business Ranking, we are  now at 77th rank from a rank of 142 in 2014.  The Goods and Services Tax,  demonetisation and other legislations that have been brought into place has  formalized the economy.  This has benefitted all sections of society, especially the  poorest sections of society.  Indeed, the Government has worked hard towards  realization of aspirations of all the sections. Nation building is no longer controlled  by an elite few.  By reducing the cost of farming, providing the farmers with fair  price for their crops, providing access to new markets, our Government has  restored the farmer‟s confidence.  Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana has ensured  crop insurance to farmers at low premiums to safeguard them from potential crisis  due to crop damage.  Providing rural santiation has been an important goal of our  Government and we have delivered.  Almost 5.45 lakh villages have been covered  in last four years.  Infrastructure creation and timely completion of projects has  been delivered by our Government.  In just 4 years, we now are at the 3rd position  in terms of number of start-ups in the world.  Our Government has created a  domino effect of prosperity.  Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas is now a reality. Our government not only took up the  challenges of 2014 and continued working on its plans but also delivered the  results. The Government has enhanced the dignity of the country in the world by  taking steps such as welfare of the poor, building infrastructure, women  empowerment, raising income of the farmers and securing the borders of the  country, containing inflation, corruption and terrorism at the same time.Today,  there is a conducive atmosphere for progress in the country and the country is  marching ahead.

My  Parliamentary Constituency Bundelkhand has been especially taken care of, be it  the work related to Ken-Betwa rivers or Bundelkhand expressway, be it a  construction work of Defence corridor or doubling or electrification of Jansi- Manikpur and Kherad-Kanpur line, be it a development of Chitrakoot circuit by  covering it in Ramayan circuit and construction of Bharat Mata Project and Ram  Van Gaman Marg. I support the motion.   The government has taken historic and bold  decisions in the interest of the country. Assistance has been provided to the poor  women through Ujjwala Yojana. Women have been given their rightful place of  honour and dignity through construction of 9 crore toilets under Swachh Bharat  Abiyan.

Under my parliamentary constituency Jammu, renovation work of Jammu railway  station should be undertaken and new airport, passport office, medical college,  AIIMS, IIT should be built there.  Construction of Jammu Poonch railway line  should be started at the earliest. I am extremely grateful to the Hon\\'ble  President of India for his visionary ideas. Moreover, the President\\'s Address has  also reflected the government\\'s objectives of comprehensive development of each  and every section of society living in every nook and corner of the country. The  Social Security Scheme launched by the Government for uplifting the poor is a  commendable step. I whole heartedly thank the Hon\\'ble President of India for his  concern for the people of North-East India. These two bridges over the river  Brahmaputra will benefit lakhs of people of the region. The passing of the 103th  Amendment to the Constitution to extend the benefit of reservation of the poor  belonging to the general category is historic step towards eradication social  disparity.   Our country can progress only when  our farmers will become self sufficient and empowered.  As a result of Jan Dhan  Yojana, 34 crore people have bank accounts in the country today.

A historic decision has  been taken to provide benefit of reservation to the poor by passing 103rd  Amendment of the Constitution.  The Government is constantly making efforts to  get the legislation relating to Triple Talaq passed for the Muslim daughters.  Our  country is marching ahead with the ideals of social and economic justice as given  by Baba Saheb Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar in the Constitution.  This way, the dream  of creation of a new India will be realized. This Government is committed  towards the welfare of the downtrodden people.  Hon\\'ble President has also  appreciated the Government for implementing demonetisation and GST, providing  reservation to economically backward section and conducting surgical strike.   Providing 10 per cent reservation to the economically backward section is a  historical step.  Government has also taken various steps to provide basic  necessities to people and to curb the menace of black money and corruption.  Apart  from that, it has also taken many initiatives for the empowerment of poor people,  women, youth and middle class.  Today, India\\'s voice is being heard with great  admiration on various global platforms.  Our country has demonstrated a new state  policy and convention by conducting surgical strike on terrorists hideouts across  the border.

Moreover, constitutional status has been accorded to National  Commission for Backward Classes. Our country has made appreciable  progress in every field during the last four and a half years.  With the construction  of 9 crore toilets, the percentage of sanitation has risen to 98 per cent which was  only 40 per cent in the year 2014.  More than six crore gas connections have been  provided under the Ujjwala Yojana.  Under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, a  provision of medical expenses upto Rs.

Maximum benefit of the Pradhan Mantri  Mudra Yojana has accrued to the women.  The Government has given the  minimum support price for 22 crops one and a half times more than their cost  price.  Bank accounts of 34 crore people have been opened in the country till date.   This has linked every family of the country with the banking system.  Our  Government started a campaign against corruption and black money right from the  first day and this has yielded good results.  The concept of One Nation-One Tax -  One Market has fructified as a result of comprehensive tax reforms such as the  GST.  The ranking of India in Ease of Doing Business was 142nd, which has now  risen to 77th.  India has become the sixth biggest economy of the world as of now.   Due to the tireless efforts of the hon. Prime Minister, effective results have come  up in respect of the Make in India initiative.  Our country has been progressing in  every field today.  With these words I strongly support the Motion of Thanks. The focus of the present Government  policies has been the welfare of the poor, middle class, the exploited and the  deprived sections, farmers, labourers and the youth of the country.  The Union  Government has taken significant steps in vital areas such as financial inclusion,  encouragement to small businesses, empowerment to the deprived communities,  housing construction, clean energy, sanitary campaign, rural electrification,  affordable and easily accessible health services, farmer welfare, women  empowerment, skill development, incentive to the entrepreneurship of Scheduled  Castes/Scheduled Tribes, welfare of the differently abled and their empowerment  and rural employment.  I thank the hon. President for this address dedicated to the  vision of all inclusiveness. The President\\'s Address clearly manifests that  the incumbent government has put back the country on the path of faster growth  and development.  After 2014, the Government has rooted out the corruption and  has also brought an end to the uncertainties  owing to which people are reposing  their faith in the Government.  The Government has taken a big initiative in  providing training and skill development to the youths.  As many as 10000 skill  development centres and more than 600 Prime Minister Skill Centres have  augmented the skills of youth.  A loan of 7 lakh crore has been disbursed to about  15 crore people under the Mudra Scheme to start their industries and businesses.   The Government has also scrapped more than 3 lakh fake companies causing huge  loss to the revenues of the country.  The number of educational institutes has been  increased to provide higher education and professional courses to the sons and  daughters of the country.  The programmes and schemes launched by hon. Prime  Minister have strengthened the women empowerment in the country.  The  Minimum Support Price of 22 crops has been increased one and half times so as to  double the income of farmers.  Several welfare schemes have been launched in the  country so as to benefit the people at large. On 31st January, H.E. the President,  gave an historic and unprecedented address in which he mentioned demonetisation,  Rafale, GST, Surgical strike, One Rank One Pension, National Police Memorial,  Ujjawala Yojana, Ayushman Yojana, Mudra Yojana.  After the hard work by the  hon. Prime Minister, the Indian economy is the most promising economy in the  world today.  About Aadhaar card, the World Bank has said that the countries of  the world should follow the Indian system of Aadhaar card.  The way the  Government has taken steps for bringing together the benefits being provided to all  the beneficiaries through Aadhaar, even the World Bank has followed the IMF in  contending that poverty is being eradicated in India.  Direct benefit of more than  Rs.7 lakh crore has been provided to the poor through these schemes.  During the  UPA-I and UPA-II regime, 1 lakh 17 thousand crore rupees used to be pocketed by  the power brokers through corruption. The hon. Prime Minister has saved this  money of the people of this country.  \\'Work is Worship\\', H.E. President has  mentioned it.  Following this, an environment of development is being created in  the country today by establishing more than 3 lakh common service centres, by  seizing benami properties worth 50,000 crore rupees and by increasing the Income  Tax base from 3.5 crore to 7 crore.  Keeping in view, the picture of India presented  by H.E. the President  in his Address and the growing confidence of the people in  this Government, I support this motion of thanks. This Government has taken a  pledge for a \\'New India\\', an India where nobody remains hungry, where everyone  gets basic healthcare and education.   This Government has tried to complete all  the suspended good initiatives of previous Governments.  Today, the railway lines  are expanding at a rapid rate, the port development is under focus, gas pipelines are  being laid, the fertiliser plants that were shut down are again being started, toilets  are being built in crores of households and new opportunities of employment are  coming up.  Be it a city or a village, the Government is trying to strengthen the  health related infrastructure.  The Government has launched the Saubhagya  Scheme to connect the households with electricity.   The benefits of Government  schemes are reaching the masses.  The poorest of poor are getting basic needs of  life fulfilled, from healthcare to sanitation, education to cooking gas, and much  more.  This Government has launched \\'Ayushaman India Scheme\\' last year.   Medicines are being provided at more than 700 of such centres at very low cost.   The direct benefit transfers are also reaching the poor without any pilferage.    The  Government is trying to double the income of the country\\'s farmers a first of its  kind initiative taken by any Government.  Goods and Services Tax (GST) has  made business easy in every part of the country.  More than 31 crore bank accounts  have been opened under Jan Dhan Yojana.  We have transferred the 27 crore  rupees of unclaimed money to their bank accounts with the help of Universal  Account Number.  Under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana loans of more than 10  lakh crore rupees have been approved.  Under UDAN scheme, 12 lakh seats have  been made available to the people at a reduced price.  We are also monitoring the  work of roads and railways with the help of drones.  Today more than 115 crore  people have Aadhaar cards.  Funds are being deposited by Direct Benefit Transfer  in the accounts of the poor for about 450 schemes of the Central Government.   Women have been the greatest beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.   Six crore women have also joined self-help groups under the Deendayal Antodaya  Yojana.  Maternity leaves have been extended from 12 weeks to 26 weeks.  The  Government is trying to bring about an end to the practice of triple talaq.  More  than 6 crore gas connections in houses under the Ujjwala scheme.  In the last four  and a half years, our Government has worked towards social and economic  development of the society.   No one can deny the truth that the India is emerging  stronger under the leadership of our Hon\\'ble PM. Against this backdrop and track  record of the Government, I can confidently say that very soon India will emerge  as an economic and social super-power under the leadership of our Hon\\'ble Prime  Minister. The Government has made a  historical move by determining 2022 the target year for providing houses to all.   The works done by the Government under the Swachha Bharat Mission is being  appreciated by the whole world.  The poor women are being provided gas  connections free of cost under the Ujjwala Scheme and as a result of which the  quality of their lives is improving.  About 2.47 crore households got electric  connections in the country under the Pradhan Mantri Saubhagya Yojana of the  Government.  Our Government has launched the Aayushman Bharat Yojana but  the Congress ruled States have not so far implemented this scheme. First of all I would like to express my gratitude  to the hon. Prime Minister for conferring the award of Bharat Ratna on Nanaji  Deshmukh who chose Chitrakoot of my Parliamentary Constituency, Satna as his  place of work.  I would like to submit that the economy of the country has acquired  the growth rate of 7.3 per cent during the last four and a half years.  India\\'s  contribution to the world GDP was 2.6 per cent in 2014 and the same has gone up  to 3.3 per cent.  The Government has formulated schemes keeping the basic  requirements of every individual in view.  In my Parliamentary Constituency of  Satna, 1,70,000 beneficiaries have been provided gas connections under the  Ujjwala scheme.  44,475 houses have been approved for construction under  Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and out of them the construction of 37,117 houses  has been completed.  2,05,800 Golden Cards have been issued to the people in my  district under the Ayushmaan Bharat Yojana.  44,826 connections have already  been provided in the Satna district under the Saubhagya Yojana.  The Modi  Government has done justice to the poor of the upper castes by providing them 10  per cent reservation.  I would like to thank the Government once again by saying  this much that the scenario of the rural and urban areas is changing and the poor  people have started believing that they might be free from problems.  The hon.  Prime Minister has provided an honest Government during the last five years.  The  way the charges of corruption are being levelled against our Government is not  conducive to the fabric of democracy. The country is celebrating 150th birth  anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation with gusto.  Hon.  President in his speech has highlighted all the aspects.  The country was passing  through a phase of uncertainty before the General Election of the year 2014.  After  formation of this Government, a resolution has been taken to make a new India.   The objective of this transparent Government was ‘Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas’.   Nine crore toilets have been constructed under Swach Bharat Mission.  More than  six crore gas connections have been provided under Ujjawala Yojana till date.  Gas  connections have been provided to 1,15,000 women in my Parliamentary  Constituency.  A provision has been made to provide cash incentives upto Rs.5  lakh each family each year in case of serious illness under Ayushman Bharat  Yojana.   The Government is also providing 6.5 per cent interest to the people of  low income group under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.  Two crore 47 lakh homes  have already been connected with electricity till date.  In my Parliamentary  Constituency 1042 villages, mohallas have been electrified. Out of 15 crore, 73 per  cent women entrepreneurs have received MUDRA loan in all over the country.   National Sports University has been set up.  The Government is making efforts day  and night to double the farmers’ income.  Soil Health Cards have been distributed,  availability of fertilizers has been ensured and 100 % neem coating of urea has also  been ensured.  In my Parliamentary Constituency 446 village Panchayats have  been connected through internet broadband.  The contribution of India in the world  GDP was 2.6 per cent in the year 2014 which has been increased upto 3.3 per cent.   A network of highways connectivity is being developed throughout the country.   Thus, our villages, labourers, women, doctors, teachers, scientists, farmers and  youth are getting benefit through all these developmental works. In the Union Budget,  extending relief to the middle class income tax limit has been doubly enhanced to  Rs.5 lakh.  This will benefit three crore taxpayers.  This Budget comprises small  rebates in various forms and structures with a view to giving a fillip to the housing  sector.  The interests accrued on bank deposits and the one received as rent has  also been increased from the existing ceiling of Rs.10 thousand to Rs.40 thousand  in terms of TDS.  This step will enhance disposable income.  Marginal farmers  having landholding upto 2 hectare would be given Rs.6 thousand per annum under  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi.  This will benefit 12 crore farmers.  This is  in honour of marginal farmers.  Defence allocation has been enhanced by 6.87 per  cent and has been increased to Rs.3.18 lakh crore.  This apart, the veterans’ morale  has also been strengthened with the implementation of one rank one pension  scheme.  Matri Vandana scheme has been launched for the pregnant women which  will go a long way in nurturing the infant as well as edifying their health profile.   With these words, I support this Budget and earnestly hope that the people would  not leave us in bad humour. This Government has created credibility  in the political arena.  People have greatly benefitted from Ayushman Bharat  Scheme.  We have made arrangement for transferring an amount of 75000 crore  rupees annually directly to the bank accounts of farmers without involving any  intermediary.  The second thing is \\'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas\\'.  There is no  discrimination on the basis of religion, class or caste.  Another aspect of \\'Sabka  Saath, Sabka Vikas\\' is development of all the regions.  We have identified 115  backward districts and have taken care of development of these districts.  We have  ensured all round development in the North East Region.  Our Government has  provided corruption free governance.  The hon\\'ble Prime Minister took a bold  decision and implemented GST.  This has resulted in the expansion of our  economy.  This Government is undertaking public welfare works with the resolve  to uplift the weakest sections of the society.  I certainly believe that this  Government would get mandate of the people again.  I support the Motion of  Thanks on the President\\'s Address. The Government under the leadership of our hon.  Prime Minister has worked to make India a strong nation.  The work done by the  Prime Minister is unmatched and no one has been able to do that in the past 70  years.  This Government has completed the schemes started by it.  In the past five  years nobody levelled charges of corruption against any Minister of the  Government.   Special relief has been provided to middle class tax payers by  raising the tax limit to five lakh rupees.  It is the first time ever that Rs. 6000 per  year would be provided to those farmers having less than 2 hectares of land.  The  Central Government has launched the  \\'Pradhan Mantri Bima Yojana, under which  the farmers will have to deposit 1.5 per cent premium for Rabi crop and 2 per cent  premium for kharif crop and rest of the premium would be provided by the Central  Government.  When we were in the power in Rajasthan  at the time we waived the  loans of farmers  upto Rs. 50,000.  In case of any natural calamity the farmer  would be provided rebate on loan amount upto 2 per cent and if he repays his loan  on time a rebate of  3 per cent would be given provided.  This Government has  provided free gas connections to eight crore poor families the Government has  launched the MUDRA Yojana under which 15 crore people have been granted  loans including 73 per cent women.  I come from western Rajasthan.  My  Parliamentary Constituency is Sri Ganganagar.  For the first time it has been  decided by the Government to make road along the 1060 kilometers of long border  under the Bharat Mala and the Government is spending 25,000 crore rupees on it.   The Government will construct a green corridor from Amritsar to Bhavnagar and a  sum of Rs. 25,000 crore has been allocated for it.  13 new trains have started  running under my Parliamentary Constituency.  And each and every railway  station is being renovated.  First time, the funds allocated by the 14th Finance  Commission as well as funds allocated by State Finance Commission has reached  Gram Panchayats.  Hon. Prime Minister has run a corruption free Government for  five years.  The Government has taken a pledge to build a new India by 2022.  I  would like to make a mention of the Rajasthan Canal which was constructed in  1970 and was not renovated till date and for the first time a proposal to this effect  was forwarded by the then hon. Chief Minister of Rajasthan and a sum of Rs. 3400  crore has been allocated by the Government for the purpose. I am particularly grateful to the Hon. Prime  Minister who has taken pains to release Rs.57 crore for developing the ‘Nirvan  Sthali’ of Kabir Saheb into a tourist destination.  Sanction has been accorded for  laying new railway lines in a small district- Sant Kabir Nagar.  With this  development, the new railway shall connect seven Parliamentary Constituencies.  The date for laying the foundation stone of this project which is likely to involve  an expenditure of Rs.5 thousand crore, is going to be fixed in the near future.   Under the campaign launched against black-money, certain strict steps such as  demonetization, Fugitive  Economic Offenders Act and laws enacted for bringing  in black-money have led to the seizure and attachment of the assets amounting to  Rs.50 thousand crore.  During this period benami properties bearing worth Rs.6900  crore and foreign assets worth Rs.1600 crore have been attached.  North Eastern  region has also been extended a host of schemes involving more than Rs.21  thousand crore.  Be it through revolution in the railways or in the field of education  or that of Ujjawala revolution, the Government has been able to translate the  dreams of those mothers and sisters who had suffered deprivation for years  together.  In the previous regime, four kilometers road used to be constructed a day  whereas 28 kilometers of road are being constructed now on daily basis.  The  railways have given a gift to the women by advertising recruitment for the 600  women. The President\\'s Address, in fact,  reflects more of true image of Bharat than India.   I convey my sincere thanks to  H.E. President of India for honouring the farmers of the country by calling them  Anna Data.  Our Government took the historic decision to give one and half times  more price than the input cost for as many as 22 crops.  Weaker sections of the  upper caste people also got 10% reservation.  According constitutional status to the  Backward Classes Commission symbolizes this Government\\'s commitment to the  cause of social justice.  The recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission have  also been implemented.  One Rank One Pension was also granted to all the  personnel of the Armed Forces and the largest health care scheme of the world has  also been implemented in the country.  Implementation of the GST was the biggest  economic reform undertaken after the independence.  Under the Mudra Scheme,  about 15 lakh people have been given loans and out of those given loans,  75% are  women.  Providing gas connection under the Ujjawala Scheme is also a welcome  step. I think, this Bill should have been brought  long back. But, there is no doubt that it is very good for the criminal justice system,  the civil system and more so for the people of this country.  I have one question.   Your object under Section 21 is that no DNA should be taken up without consent.   If some investigating agency or any other agency abuses that power, what steps  would be taken against that person under this law?  In a criminal case, unless  consent in writing is given, nothing can be taken and if the investigating agency  wants to take it, they have to make an application.  But how a civil dispute would  be covered?  Therefore, immigration authority will be having the excessive power  to collect the DNA which is not your object.  Then come many other cases.  In a  case of medical negligence, how will DNA come into that?  There is an issue  relating to abandoned children and disputed children.  Until a child attains 18 years  of age, can his DNA be collected?  Does it not violate. The Child Protection Rights  Act?  This Act has many laudable objectives.  So many preventive steps have been  taken.  People will be secure and things will be done properly. I would like to congratulate the  Minister for bringing this long pending Bill.  This Bill is very important.  Recently,  there was a famous case of a senior politician over the fixation of parentage.  As  you  know, the parentage was finally decided with the help of the DNA  technology. I would like to raise certain issues.  There are two clauses-clauses 21  and 23 in civil matters-which state that no consent is required.  There is no clarity  in this matter.  A civil matter comes when there is a dispute about the parentage  and a child is claimed by different people.  I think, there must be clarity with  regard to the consent in civil matters, whether consent of accused or victim is  required, what the procedure is and whether it would require a Magistrate\\'s order.   These things need to be clarified.  In medical cases also, DNA technology is  absolutely necessary to ascertain whether negligence was there.  Now, I come to  storage of data. There is no clarity on storage of these profiles in the DNA  laboratories.    With regard to databank, we have clarity on regulatory board, but  there is no clarity on clause 31(4) with regard to data storage in a DNA lab.  I  would request the Minister to clarify this point. The common man of the country  has had been demanding for decades that if SC, ST categories have got reservation  then there should also be reservation in Government jobs for the economically  backward people of the general category.  Now this reservation will be provided  through amendment in the Article 15 and Article 16 of the Constitution. Our leader  and hon. Chief Minister of Bihar, Nitish Kumar ji has already been an advocate of  this reservation.  Economically backward people of general category of all  religions shall be given 10 per cent reservation in the jobs and educational  institutions.  This is an example of implementation of Modiji’s philosophy of  ‘Sab  Ka Sath, Sab Ka Vikas’.  This proposal of giving reservation to economically  backward people of general category was also brought during the time of Narsimha  Rao ji but then it was declared unconstitutional.  Today, I am hopeful that our  colleagues from Congress will also welcome this Bill.  I support this Bill. A Constitution (Amendment) Bill  has been moved as a special agenda. Attempts have been made to identify the  economically weaker section of the society, and provide them and support them  with affirmative action. Not only the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes are poor,  backward classes are poor, but people who are from general category are also poor  who are in need of education, in need of services, in need of employment. The  economically weaker section of society needs to be identified and they should be  provided affirmative support. For the first time in the history of our democratic  republic, economically weaker sections of citizens are being provided the benefit  through affirmative action. Clauses 4 and 5 of Article 15, and clause 4 of Article  16 provide reservation for people as per caste.  But here, as per their economic  status, reservation is going to be provided both in services as well as in  employment. The economic criterion needs adequate reformation every ten years.  A poor is a poor and he needs all sorts of support from the Government and also  from society. The poor have to be identified and the poor have to be provided with  all sorts of affirmative support from the Government and that is what is required.  The identification of the beneficiary would be on economic criteria and that needs  to be upgraded invariably in a time period. The State Government will determine  about the economically weaker category.  I support this Bill. Our Party will support  this Bill. I rise to speak in support of 124th  Amendment Bill of the Constitution. We will provide opportunity to the weaker  section of society i.e. the poor to move forward under Article 46 of the Directive  Principles of State Policy.  It is a historical step after the journey of 72 years of  independence.  Hon. Modiji is worthy of congratulation for this.  He should also be  congratulated for executing the work of providing this reservation without  tampering the reservation given to other Backward Castes, Scheduled Castes and  Scheduled Tribes.  When the Government of Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee came to  power, the place of development in the country increased rapidly during those six  years.  When the Government of Modiji came to power, the pace of development  increased four fold on all fronts and a lot of avenues for jobs are being made  available.  There is a large section in general category also which needs some  support.  The welfare of the poor from general category should also be taken into  concern.  The Government has given the benefit of reservation to the poor general  category without reducing anyone\\'s reservation even by one per cent.  Such poor  can be from any castes of general category.  Only the coalition Government of  NDA can take big steps here. Today, the Government which is committed towards  the poor in the country has once again proved that it is committed for the welfare  of Dalit, backward and poor of upper castes with full dedication. Today is a big historic day.  Today Modi ji  has taken a historic step to provide reservation to those castes among SC, ST, OBC  and forward classes who were not covered earlier for this purpose.  No  Government provided legitimate power to OBC\\'s but Modi Government.  After 70  years of independence there was grudge among forward classes against SC, ST and  OBC reservation and protests were being organized against reservation.  Now this  step has put a complete check on said protests.  It is indeed \\'Sabka Saath Sabka  Vikas\\'.  All citizens of the country who are facing injustice would be very happy  with this decision.  Our civilization and culture is above caste system but due to  wrong policies castes have been divided.  Hon\\'ble Modi ji and the Government has  brought this Bill to end the bane of poverty.  I support this Bill and urge upon all  the parties to do so. History is being created today in this  august House.  The Constitution (124th Amendment) Bill providing 10 per cent  reservation is going to pave the way for the prosperity of the children of the poor  from general category.  The poor people of the general category were deprived of  Government jobs for want of  reservation for them.  Moreover, they were deprived  of getting admission to the higher institutions of education.  But such a significant  decision taken by the Government has sent a message among the people of general  category that this Government takes care of everybody.  At the same time, the  existing system of reservation has not been tinkered with.  People from all the  religions have been covered under the ambit of this 10 per cent reservation. This is a good decision to provide 10%  reservation to the economically weaker sections of general category.  I used to  demand time and again that economically weaker sections of general category  should also get reservation.  Members from the opposition are saying that today is  the last day.  What difference does it make?  After all the Bill has been introduced.   They used to interrupt the proceedings of the House due to which this delay  happened.  Baba Saheb Ambedkar wanted to have equality in the society.  That is  why hon. Prime Minister has given the slogan, \\'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas\\'.  My  party, the Republican Party supports this Bill. The dream as well as the cause I  have been cherishing and fighting for all through my life has been translated into  reality today.   \\'Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas\\' has been the primordial plank and the  basic guiding principle of this Government.  All the schemes piloted by this  Government are aimed at ameliorating the status of the poor, those living in  cottages and the destitute.  Today a Bill for the reservation of the poor and the  helpless belonging to upper castes has come up and I support the Bill.  Alongside, I  would urge upon crores of youth of the country to wake up and  welcome the new  sun of development that has appeared on the horizon and of course I would take  this opportunity to egg on them to take the society forward driven by inclusive  spirit. As per the prevalent situation today,  it is an outdated impression that leprosy cannot be cured and therefore, it will be a   cause for divorce.  So, this Bill seeks to amend various Acts.  But nowadays, with  modern medicines, leprosy is curable.  I fully support the amendments that have  been moved in this Bill. The opposition sought a discussion  on an important issue and we expressed our willingness to hold a discussion.  But  the Congress Party took more than 20 days to prepare itself for this discussion.   The national security is not paramount for them.  This Government enters into   defence agreements keeping national interest in mind.  In fact, in their regime no  defence deal would be completed without a ‘deal’ involved in it.  There is a long  list of scams perpetrated by them, be it Bofors,  Submarine, Augusta Westland,  National Herald case.  All these scams took place to arrange political funding for  the Congress Party.  Now the Supreme Court’s decision has come and it is a  victory for our Armed Forces, of truth and that of the Government and at the same  time this is a serious setback to the Congress Party.  The Supreme Court has stated  in detail that they looked into the pricing, procedure and the offset clause and  found that there was no commercial favouratism.  This also proves that this  Government has strengthened the Armed Forces, and took this decision in the  larger national interest.  The Congress Party must know that they could not take a  decision in this regard for ten long years and now they raise the issue relating to  the Rafale.  Finally, this deal has been completed by our Government.  Had your  Government clinched this deal, then our Government would not have at all  required to procure these aircraft.  I would like to ask as to why the name of one  family crops up repeatedly in defence deals.  Today, our Armed Forces are happy,  the Government is happy and the people of the country are also happy.  The  decision of the Hon. Supreme Court has established the truth in clear terms. The Government has completed the  deal for procurement of 36 Rafale aircraft with the Dassault Aviation in a  transparent manner.   Our Government has completed this deal in a minimum  possible time, though this deal was pending for ten long years. The opposition is  constantly raising the issue of corruption in this deal.  The Congress party has lost  its faith in Hon. Supreme Court.  When the Supreme Court stated that there was no  violation of rules in this deal, still this Government is being targeted for gaining  some political mileage only.  The Air Force of the country has also stated that this  fighter aircraft is good for the defence of the country.  Only issue is that of offset  contract.  The French Government and the Dassault Aviation have categorically  stated that there was no pressure from the Government of India in this regard.  The  HAL has also stated that they were not in a position to manufacture Rafale.  Our  Air Force is going to receive 36 Rafale aircraft and our Air Force personnel are  happy about it. The present Aadhaar Bill has some  amendments proposed in the backdrop of the Supreme Court judgement and seeks  to address the issues of privacy and probity.  The Hon. Minister has made it clear  that no person shall be denied the benefits of the social welfare schemes in the  absence of the Aadhaar.  The Government has done many such things which have  given solid base for the Aadhaar.  Two or three provisions of the present Bill  are  especially made to remove the earlier discrepancies.  Earlier, some people were  looting the benefits meant for the poor.  Now the Aadhaar has eliminated those  people and the schemes are being implemented smoothly.  The Government has  saved Rs. 90,000 crore by linking schemes with Aadhaar.  This amount would  prove to be a relief to the poor.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":20}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["for i in range(0, 5):\n","  category = combined_speeches['Category'][i]\n","  text = combined_speeches['Speech'][i]\n","  print(category)\n","\n","  tokens = nltk.wordpunct_tokenize(text)\n","  finder = BigramCollocationFinder.from_words(tokens)\n","  scored = finder.score_ngrams(bigram_measures.raw_freq)\n","  print(\"Bigram\")\n","  print(sorted(bigram for bigram, score in scored))\n","\n","  finder = TrigramCollocationFinder.from_words(tokens)\n","  finder = TrigramCollocationFinder.from_words(tokens, window_size=4)\n","  print(\"Trigram\")\n","  print(sorted(finder.nbest(trigram_measures.raw_freq, 4)))\n","  print()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","output_embedded_package_id":"179UO-jDu5mX0v24Oh1Z5w-2Vim_5ZOFo"},"id":"h79WypwUhcPW","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710795631348,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":11741,"user":{"displayName":"045_Punerva Singh","userId":"02056743895864260867"}},"outputId":"b3fbef06-823d-45a0-f0fa-dd3b1b1c0370"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Output hidden; open in https://colab.research.google.com to view."},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Using contingency table values\n","\n","While frequency counts make marginals readily available for collocation finding, it is common to find published contingency table values.

India had exported 3.7 million tonnes of non-basmati rice in the year 2006-07 and 5.28 million tonnes in 2007-08. The Government does review the availability of food grains within the country on a continuing basis. There was a general rise in food grain prices in the latter half of the year 2007. On 15th October, 2007, the Government imposed a ban on the export of non-basmati rice. This decision was occasioned by the general rise in food grain prices and an overall assessment of the domestic supply position. The global prices of all types of rice continued to rise steeply over the next few months peaking in April-May 2008. Prices of rice nearly doubled in the international market in a space of less than six months. Escalating food prices created situations of extreme distress in many parts of the world especially in the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and some poor African countries. The Governments of these African countries approached the Government of India with a request to sell them limited quantities of non-basmati rice. And that was, I may add here, a hundred per cent broken rice. Keeping in view our close international ties with these countries and the delicate supply position they were facing, it was decided on diplomatic considerations to authorize the export of limited quantities of non-basmati rice in relaxation of the ban. This was a Government decision. In pursuance of this decision, the Director-General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) had issued a notification on 24th January 2008 authorising the export of non-basmati rice of 50,000 Metric Tonnes (MT) to Madagascar through the State Trading Corporation of India (STC) and 25,000 MT to Comoros and 9,000 Metric tonnes to Mauritius through the MMTC Limited.\"]\n","# txt1 = [text]\n","\n","# Preprocessing\n","def remove_string_special_characters(s):\n","\n","    # removes special characters with ' '\n","    stripped = re.sub('[^a-zA-z\\s]', '', s)\n","    stripped = re.sub('_', '', stripped)\n","\n","    # Change any white space to one space\n","    stripped = re.sub('\\s+', ' ', stripped)\n","\n","    # Remove start and end white spaces\n","    stripped = stripped.strip()\n","    if stripped != '':\n","            return stripped.lower()\n","\n","for i in range(0, 5):\n","  category = combined_speeches['Category'][i]\n","  print(category.upper())\n","  text = combined_speeches['Speech'][i]\n","  txt1 = [text]\n","\n","  # Stopword removal\n","  stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n","  your_list = ['skills', 'ability', 'job', 'description']\n","  for i, line in enumerate(txt1):\n","      txt1[i] = ' '.join([x for\n","          x in nltk.word_tokenize(line) if\n","          ( x not in stop_words ) and ( x not in your_list )])\n","\n","  # Getting trigrams\n","  vectorizer = CountVectorizer(ngram_range = (3,3))\n","  X1 = vectorizer.fit_transform(txt1)\n","  features = (vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())\n","  print(\"\\n\\nFeatures : \\n\", features)\n","  print(\"\\nX1 : \\n\", X1.toarray())\n","\n","  # Applying TFIDF\n","  vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(ngram_range = (3,3))\n","  X2 = vectorizer.fit_transform(txt1)\n","  scores = (X2.toarray())\n","  print(\"\\nScores : \\n\", scores)\n","\n","  # Getting top ranking features\n","  sums = X2.sum(axis = 0)\n","  data1 = []\n","  for col, term in enumerate(features):\n","      data1.append( (term, sums[0,col] ))\n","  ranking = pd.DataFrame(data1, columns = ['term','rank'])\n","  words = (ranking.sort_values('rank', ascending = False))\n","  print (\"\\nWords head : \\n\", words.head(10))\n","  print()\n","  print()"],"metadata":{"id":"MPqktesBdsQJ","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710795647060,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3346,"user":{"displayName":"045_Punerva Singh","userId":"02056743895864260867"}},"outputId":"b163af29-ba68-4e9e-cdae-6373a9b92a26"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["APPRECIATE\n","\n","\n","Features : \n"," ['00 00 00' '00 00 000' '00 000 crore' ...

We are concerned about those medical students who have come back from  Ukraine.  The attack on Ukraine by Russia is a disastrous step.  Nearly 3,000 civilians  have been killed or injured in this war.  The cost of direct damage to Ukraine\\u201fs  infrastructure amid Russia\\u201fs ongoing invasion has reached almost an estimated figure of  63 billion dollars.  We expected that the war would be stopped.  But it did not.  India\\u201fs  responsibility was aimed at evacuating the Indian citizens from Ukraine and it did so.  It  was a good step.  We can initiate dialogue to end the war.  \",\n          \"Unfortunately, for India, since  1947, we have focussed a lot on the Western front, but we have not spoken even a  little bit about the Eastern front.  The incidents which have been taking place in our  country are still taking place even after 1947 till date.  After independence in 1947  two more nations have been formed in this country.  What is the condition of  Hindus there.  The estimates shows that the Hindus which were 15 per cent earlier  has been reduced upto 0.72 per cent in one country and in the other it has been  reduced upto 7 per cent.  This is the reason for bringing this legislation.  In the year  1901, the population of Muslims in Assam was 12.4 per cent and this has been  increased upto 34.22 per cent in the year 2011.  This is a huge increase and this is  how democratic dividends are being sought.  It is nothing but vote bank politics  and appeasement which is going on in the country.  There is difference between  legal migration, illegal migration and migration due to economic policies.  If you  follow social media, you will find that how the infiltration is still going on and this  is actually harmful to the secular fabric of this country because attempt is to  constantly get focus away from western border and ISI and such activities are  involved in getting this migration done.  This is the reason by which these  activities are taking place from eastern border from Assam to Bangladesh.   That is  why demography is changing there.\",\n          \"The Supreme Court had pronounced the talaq- e-biddat as unconstitutional.  A number of other judgments delivered by the  various courts of our country are also there which have pronounced this practice as  unconstitutional.  But, there is not a single judgment where it has been said that the  Government should make the talaq-e-biddat a criminal offence. It clearly  demonstrates that the purpose of this Government is to demonize and penalize the  Muslim men.  The Government should have provided protection to the Muslim  women by bringing them under the ambit of the Domestic Violence Act, 2005.   We, therefore, demand that the Government should bring this Bill in a  constitutionally appropriate manner.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 55,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Tuesday, August 6, 2019\",\n          \"Monday, February 5, 2024\",\n          \"Monday, August 5, 2019\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Oath\",\n          \"Union Budget\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Gender\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"F\",\n          \"M\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Party\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 38,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jan Adhikar Party\",\n          \"SDF\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Call For Action\",\n          \"Blame\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":26}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Convert date to datetime format\n","df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])\n","\n","# Extract year from the date\n","df['Year'] = df['Date'].dt.year\n","\n","# Group speeches by year and category, and combine them into one string\n","combined_speeches_yearly = df.groupby(['Year', 'Category'])['Speech'].apply(' '.join).reset_index()"],"metadata":{"id":"n2HsomP5mKmf"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["combined_speeches_yearly"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":708},"id":"G0wPWfpSqKfY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710795655017,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1268,"user":{"displayName":"045_Punerva Singh","userId":"02056743895864260867"}},"outputId":"442f1b5f-ab0c-408d-cf1d-5ab7e593ab85"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["    Year         Category                                             Speech\n","0   2019       Appreciate  Chit fund was envisaged for the help and  supp...\n","1   2019            Blame  At the outset, I would like to say  that the e...\n","2   2019  Call For Action  It has been observed that there was no  specif...\n","3   2019            Issue  It has been a long standing problem to  provid...\n","4   2019          Neutral  We have more than 30,000 registered chit  fund...\n","5   2020  Call For Action  We are discussing the  Major Port Autorities B...\n","6   2021       Appreciate  Our government has brought a serious reform  t...\n","7   2021            Blame  This is a retrogressive amendment.

This  is very deep-rooted.  This has especially tarnished the image of people in  politics.  Poor people invest their money because of faith but their entire  investment has been looted.  I feel the steps the Government is taking are very  good.  Hon. Finance Minister should address all the issues raised hon. Members.   More than 250 chit fund companies are there in West Bengal only.  This Bill  should certainly be passed rather it should be made more stringent.  I would like to thank the hon. Prime  Minister and the Minister of Home Affairs for bringing in the Jammu and Kashmir  Reorganization Bill and a Statutory Resolution.  Sardar Ballabh Bhai Patel, Bhim  Rao Ambedkar and Shayama Prasad Mukherjee had opposed the inclusion of the  Article 370 in the Constitution at the time of its inclusion.  But the politics of  vested interests got it included in the Constitution.  What has the Article 370 so far  brought to Jammu and Kashmir?  Article 370 has only widened the gap between  India and Jammu and Kashmir.  It has provided nothing else but unemployment,  corruption and terrorism to the people of Jammu and Kashmir.  No one is ready to  set up a big factory in Jammu and Kashmir as no one can purchase land over there.   I would like to tell you that the people from all over the country are availing of the  benefits of 'Ayushman Bharat Scheme' but the people of Jammu and Kashmir are  deprived of the benefits of this scheme.  This is only because there is no big  hospital nor anyone is ready to set up big hospital there.  The entire country was  celebrating the passing of the Bill which was intended to provide 10 per cent  reservation to the poor of general category but the people of Jammu were  disappointed because this legislation could not be enforced in Jammu and Kashmir.   Hence, the people want that Article 370 and 35A associated with Jammu and  Kashmir should be scrapped.  If the daughters of Jammu and Kashmir are got  married in other States, she has to lose her identity.  All her relations come to an  end.  I would also like to state that the entire country is aware of what happened to  Kashmiri Pandits.  So, Kashmiri Pandits will not be in a position to live with peace  unless and until they are properly rehabilitated.    In fact, Jammu and Kashmir  has been relegated to the category of a backward State only because of the Article  370 and 35A.  The States where  Article 370 is not enforced, people are happy and  prosperous.  The condition of the refugees of West Pakistan is still quite pitiable  though they have been living in Jammu and Kashmir for the last 70 years.  Today,  history will be created here in the House. It is very clearly  mentioned that Article 370 is a temporary provision.  When it is being abrogated,  there is no need to make such an issue out of it.  We have seen that in the passage  of every Bill we find that the provisions of the Bills are applicable to the entire  country except to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.  After the passage of this Bill,  we will not have this anomaly.  We believe that we will have the best governance  after the bifurcated status of the State of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.  The  country is going to be very safe and the real dreams of people will come true in the  coming days.   The Government now should take all initiatives to bring Kashmiri  Pandits back.  With abolition of 35A, I am sure, wonderful developments are going  to take place in fields of tourism, IT and in every other sphere.  Many other  anomalies would be removed and corrected after the passage of this Bill and we  are going to see a beautiful Kashmir hereafter.     My Party and I myself are in support of the  resolution to accord J&K and Laddakh the status of Union Territories.  It has been   a long pending demand.  This move has sent a wave of immense pleasure among  the masses particularly among the Buddhist followers of Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar.   In fact, Dr. Ambedkar happened to make a statement disapproving of the draft of  Article 370 wherein he said on record that the residents of Kashmir have equal  rights to grow in India as is available to the other citizens of the country.  Contrary  to his wishes the citizens of India have been barred from settling down, or  acquiring land or entering into trade and profession in Kashmir.  This is totally  unacceptable.  I support this Bill. This is a historic Bill brought in by  the Government.  I rise to support this Bill on behalf of our Party.  This apart, I  would like to urge upon the hon. Minister to have plan B in  place to convert POK  into IOK somewhere down the line.  Part 2 of the Jammu Reorganization Bill  consists of two main issues.  One of these pertains to the formation of Union  Territory of Laddakh without an assembly Legislature and the other one is  concerning formation of Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir  with an assembly  Legislature.  This is welcome move and has been hailed by the masses concerned.   Earlier, I happened to be part of a delegation to Kashmir and received firsthand  accounts of the pathetic condition people of J&K, who have been reeling under for  years together.  We learnt from the masses that there is no development in J&K  even tourism is in rough patch.  So is the case with employment and industrial  development.  So finding the happy medium seemed to be  the best way forward.  Yesterday, many people were saying that it is a dark day.  How can it be a dark day  if development will reach all the people, employment will be provided, industries  will be set up in Kashmir?  Therefore, it is not a dark day rather it is a  revolutionary day, a day of development.  Yesterday, hon. Home Minister has told  that he will make it number one state in the matter of development in the next five  years.  Jobs will be provided to the Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, youths of Kashmir.   Till now, there was no development in Kashmir, therefore, we are supporting this  Bill due to these promises.  Kashmir is a paradise on earth.  It is sad that we could  not protect beautiful Kashmir for so long. The people of Kashmir are lovely  people. Injustice has been done to them for so long.  We are supporting this Bill to  bring justice to them. It is a historic day when  historical mistakes have been rectified. Ladakh has been neglected for the last 71  years with vehement demand for U.T. status ever since but this never seized the  deserved attention of the powers that be in the past.   Ladakh has its unique culture.  Abrogation of Article 370 will certainly make the future of Jammu and Kashmir  bright.  Every religious organization has demanded U.T. status for Ladakh.  Some  people say that there will be no equality in Jammu and Kashmir in the absence of  Article 370 whereas they themselves meted out step-motherly treatment to Ladakh.   Article 370 has been misused against the minorities in Jammu and Kashmir.  I  thank the Government of India and all the hon. Members who supported this Bill. Our Government has taken a historic  decision and I on my behalf and on the behalf of my Party extend our heartfelt  thanks to hon. Prime Minister and hon. Home Minister.  Until now, we just heard  about the united India but today the country has been united in real terms.  We  ourselves alienated Kashmir from the whole country by inserting the Article 370 in  our Constitution.  Today the leaders of opposition parties have also accepted that  we are fulfilling the promises made by us at the time of election.  Jammu and  Kashmir remained detracted from the path of development and progress for so  many years.  Now it will join the journey of development and progress.  Laddakh  has also got its own identity and after becoming the Union Territory, the wishes of  aspirations of the people of the State will also be fulfilled by this historic decision  taken by our Government. I rise to support the Bill.  Article 370 of our  Constitution, being a temporary provision has to go for the good of the people of  Jammu and Kashmir.  In effect, a historical mistake that took place about 70 years  ago is now being corrected through this Bill.  All sorts of assistance was provided  to the State of Jammu and Kashmir in the past but everything went into drain.  In  return, we got bloodshed and terrorism.  Our own Kashmiri pundits have been  thrown out of Kashmir.  Complete integration of Jammu and Kashmir into India  will be one nation with one flag and one Constitution.  Infrastructural facilities,  peace and prosperity across the region will improve.  The hon. Home Minister is  on record saying that as soon as the situation normalizes, Jammu and Kashmir  would be made as a full-fledged State.  This House may kindly be enlightened if   he has set any timeline in this regard.  I want to know as to what supplemental,  incidental and consequential measures the Government is going to take for Jammu  and Kashmir. I stand in support of the Bill.  My party  Shiromani Akali Dal clearly stands for a strong federal set up but, at the same time,  we believe in a strong and united India.  During partition, when a lot of minorities  shifted from Pakistan to the rest of India and J&K, they were given equal amount  of property or some compensation but the people from Pak Occupied Kashmir or  from Pakistan who migrated to Jammu & Kashmir have not got any compensation  till date.  Minorities of Jammu & Kashmir are depressed and suppressed because  there was no Minority Commission in Jammu & Kashmir.  A lot of residents of  Jammu and Kashmir have settled down in Punjab.  They have bought land in  Punjab but people of Punjab cannot buy land in Jammu and Kashmir.  I  congratulate the Prime Minister and the Home Minister for taking this bold  decision. I rise to support this Bill.  Had Sardar  Ballabh Bhai Patel handled the Kashmir issue, the current situation would not have  emerged.  Kashmiri people have not developed a connect with the rest of the  country only because of this Article 370.  Many important laws are not enforced in  Kashmir due to this Article.  If a Kashmiri girl marries a man from any other State,  she loses her Kashmiri citizenship.  Democracy in the valley has been suppressed  and corruption flourished due to this Article 370.  The Government of India  provides huge packages to this State yet it failed to register development.  So, I  congratulate the Government for today's decision.  This decision is going to change  the history of India, not geography.  The people of who went to Kashmir, even after  70 years, they are still nomads.  This Bill has been brought to deliver justice to  those people.   Even a single Member of Congress party did not utter even a single  word about Reservation Bill because reservation is not in their behaviour.  This  Bill is the last nail in the legislation which you had been legislated against  Kashmir.  From today, the whole India has been united in a true sense.  I am happy  today that our generation is the witness of the time when Article 370 is being  repealed. I feel that we will get the real  independence today with the passage of this Bill.  The credit for this independence  definitely goes to those soldiers who had been fighting and laying down their lives  for this issue for the last 70 years.  I would like to thank the Government for  bringing in this Bill in the very first session.  I believe that this Bill matters a lot for  the youths and hence I support this Bill. It has been clearly mentioned in the  Constitution to promote brotherhood, to give respect to each citizen and provide  equal rights to everyone.   But Congress and two families from Jammu and  Kashmir kept playing games with the people there for their vested interests.  Had  Nehruji not ordered ceasefire then even Lahore would have been a part of India  today.  Shri Shyama Prasad Mukherji was murdered in Kashmir in 1953 when he  had gone there to oppose the permit and particularly Article 370.  Congress did not  even order an enquiry into his murder.  I support this Bill. Today, we all can celebrate Holi and Diwali  today itself.  Today it is the day of culmination of all the hard work that was being  done by our party for the last 70 years, the purpose for which agitations were being  held continuously, the purpose for which our first President Shyama Prasad  Mukherji gave away his life.  For this, I would like to congratulate hon. Prime  Minister, hon. Home Minister in particular on behalf of all the workers and all the  people that they brought such a Bill and that this Bill is being passed before us.    The mistake made by the Congress party, the mistake made by Nehruji due to  which we suffered so much, that mistake has been corrected today. I rise to support, on behalf of Shiv  Sena, the Amendment Bill brought to remove Article 370 and make Jammu and  Kashmir a Union Territory.  I pay respects to the jawans who laid down their lives  for the protection of Jammu and Kashmir since independence.  Today, every  Indian from Kashmir to Kanyakumari  is feeling overjoyed.  Kashmir is paradise of  India.  But unfortunately the Congress Government has, in the last 72 years, tried  to destroy this paradise.  Today, the people of Kashmir have achieved freedom in  the true sense for which they had been waiting.  Something should also be done for  the Kashmiri Pandits who got displaced due to Article 370. This Bill will pave the way for bringing self- respect and dignity to a marginalized society.  This Bill substantiates that we have  not been treating transgender as per what the Constitution mandates us to do.  So, it  is a laudable move.  I had gone through the Bill and did not find a provision  treating transgender as OBCs as per an earlier judgement of  the Supreme Court.   So, I request the hon. Minister to please consider this.  With these observations,  hoping that my suggestions will be taken into consideration, I support the Bill. I rise to support the historic Bill.  This  Bill established a law for lakhs of transgender persons who have been deprived of  their rights.  To bring the marginalized communities to the centre is a core  objective of this Bill.  It is shameful that access to basic facilities and basic  services is not given to them.  This is the more failure.  The State Governments and  the Central Government will prepare their own Health Manual.  I would like to say  that it is this Government which has stood by the marginalized whether it is was  the Muslim women, whether it was the SCs, STs and now, the transgenders who  have always been respected in Indian society. I would like to thank the Prime Minister of the   country and the Minister of Social Welfare and Empowerment for bringing in this  Bill for the protection of the rights of the transgender persons and for their welfare.   This Bill has been amended as per the recommendations made by the  Parliamentary Standing Committee.  The transgender persons are viewed with a   discriminatory approach in our society.  Hence, all the possible efforts are required  to be made to bring them into the mainstream of the society.  I support this Bill  which is intended to provide opportunities of education, employment and  healthcare facilities to the transgender persons. Even today the transgender persons  are subject to social boycott and discrimination in our society.  They have to face a  number of difficulties in the pursuit of earning their livelihood.  Not only that, they  are compelled to take recourse to begging.  This Bill provides for adequate  measures for the recognition of the identity of the transgender persons, equal  opportunity of education and employment, social security and healthcare facilities  along with eliminating the discrimination being meted out to them.  At the same  time, such a mechanism is required to be set up that may facilitate the persons of  this community to avail of the pension benefits.  With these words, I support this  Bill. Transgender community in the  country is a community which is most marginal because they do not fit under the  general categories of male or female.  As a result thereof, they have had been  facing problems like social boycott, discrimination, lack of educational facilities,  unemployment, lack of medical facilities etc.  Today, the Government has tried to  bring equality to them.  In clause 6 of this Bill, a provision has been made for the  education, social security and health of the transgenders separately.  The  Government has been taking not only one but many welfare measures for them.   There is a provision for constituting a national council for the transgenders.  A  facility of pension could have been provided to them on the lines of handicapped  persons.  This Bill will remove the pain or harassment faced by the families,  especially the parents on the birth of transgender children.  This Bill will provide to  the transgenders not only the Right to Equality in the society but also remove the  feeling of being a separate category from their mind.  Today is an historic day, I  support this Bill. Only we have discriminated against the people  of transgender community in the society.  The society has not tried to understand  their feelings.  They  also  have the right to live in the society but they have to get  separated from their family itself.  Due to lack of understanding, the parents  abandon their transgender children.  Now, after the passing of this Bill, the parents  will not behave with their transgender children in this manner because now they  will not be required to give answer to the questions raised by the society.  It is a  very important Bill and our Government deserves accolades for that because this  Bill has been brought to reform the society.    I applaud the Government for their effort to  regulate the practice of surrogacy.  I request the Minister to reconsider the  provision which lays down the waiting time of five years.  The Bill should define  'close relative' term clearly.  I also request the Minister to ensure anonymity of the  surrogate.  There should not be any overlap of authority between the national and  state level boards.  The Bill must provide a review and appeal procedure for  surrogacy applications which would give couples the right to challenge the  decision of the Boards.  There should be single uniform agenda to guide doctors or  patients.  The Government should invite successful surrogacy specialists on board  and consult with them to give a decent plan for the aspiring parents. I would like to congratulate the hon'ble  Minister for this Bill. It will streamline the practice of surrogacy in our country.  The hon'ble Minister has made a lot of provisions for ethical surrogacy in the Bill  like the setting up of National and State Boards. Board will be set up at national  and state level. These Boards will advise people regarding the Central Government  policy matters relating to surrogacy.  The National Surrogacy Board will also  supervise the state bodies.  There is a regulation in the Bill that only \\u201cclose  relatives\\u201d can be surrogate mother and no one else could be. It has some problem  as the speaker prior to me has said \\u2013 \\u2018closeness\\u2019 is not defined here. Suppose some  spouse live in orphanage who does not have any close relatives and if some  infertility case comes before them, where will they approach and who will become  their close relative in such a situation? I would like the Minister to ponder over  this. The provisions of penalty in the Bill are very good. If you want to implement  the penalty in a proper way and if you want to regulate it, some kind of inspection  mechanism should be there. The inspection mechanism should be better to  implement rules and regulations in a proper manner and see their effect, otherwise  problem will occur. This Bill aims to regulate the  surrogacy services in the country. This Bill prohibits the sale and purchase of  human embryos and gametes.  This Bill prevents commercialization of surrogacy  and prohibits potential exploitation of surrogate mothers.  This Bill aims to protect  the rights of children born through surrogacy.  Infertility is growing in India.  Surrogacy is helpful in such cases. Surrogacy has become powerful way of saving  marriages of childless couples.  It is mentioned in the Bill that a surrogate mother  should be a close relative. I would like to know from the hon'ble Minister as to  what is the definition of a close relative.  Our Government is sensitive towards  women, their safety, their health and dignity. I support this Bill. I support the Bill introduced by hon'ble  Minister of Health.  Along with this, I want to see in practice that it is implemented  in a transparent, disciplined way and with a far-reaching approach in the context of  practice and process of surrogacy. But with this facility we\\u2019ll have to ensure that it  is accepted easily in our society and this acceptability will be there only when the  surrogate mother belongs to that very family. Woman should not be treated as  machine of reproduction. There should be special provision in this regard. As it is  being practiced in hospitals, clinics, we should be very much concerned about the  health of would be mothers. There should be thorough investigation of the couple  before State or Central Board and permission should be given only if they are  found unfit for reproduction. Second, we have to strictly keep an eye on such  women who are engaged in commercial surrogacy. This treatment is costly, the  poor cannot adopt it.  There should be some provision in this Act for our those  poor sisters who remain in distress due to their infertility.  I thank you while  supporting this Bill from the core of my heart. I support Supreme Court (Number of Judges)  Amendment Bill, 2019.  There has been remarkable change in the judicial system  during the tenure of the hon. Law Minister.  I would like to request the hon. Law  Minister that the language used in the courts in various States should be respective  official language of that State.  It would bring about great change in the judicial  system. Litigation is becoming costly and cost of litigation in the Supreme Court is  even more.  The Government should study it and try to address this issue.  I would  like to appreciate the Supreme Court that cases are disposed of expeditiously there.   A number of hon. Members have put forth their views regarding National Judicial  Appointments Commission.  Our Government has taken concrete steps to improve  the judicial system.  We are moving ahead towards a new India.  Our Law Minister  should try to take steps to ensure disposal of all the pending cases in the country by  the year 2022.  Those who remember their  history, progress.  Today, we are discussing the incident of Jallianwala Bagh and I  would like to inform the House that the facts should be recorded in the history.   Grandfather of a leader of this Party in Punjab  had sent a telegram to General  Dyer approving his action at Jallianwala Bagh.  This is recorded history.  I would,  once again, like to say that this Bill is a perfect Bill.  How the leader of a Party  which approved of the action at Jallianwala Bagh and attacked the Akal Takht  Saheb, be kept on the Trust of Jallianwala Bagh. I rise to support the  Jallianwala  Bagh National Memorial (Amendment) Bill on behalf of my Party Shiv Sena.  As I  know Jallianwala Bagh is the memorial of cruelty of Britishers and symbol of  patriotism as well.  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre took place in the year 1919 and  now it has completed hundred years.  There was a movement of Salt Satyagrah in  the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi.  Britishers had imposed tax on salt and during  that time Mahatma Gandhi crossed from Shiroda village which lies in my  Parliamentary Constituency Sindhudurg.  Whenever freedom struggle was fought  in the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, all those places must be turned into a  memorial to preserve the history.    Jallianwala Bagh massacre was  not an ordinary incident.  The seeds of this incident were sown immediately after  the revolt of 1857.  Thereafter, when Gandhiji returned to India from Africa, he  raised his voice against the Rowlatt Act and he also carried out Satyagrah against  it.  Wide-spread protests were launched against the Rowlatt Act in each and every  city of Punjab.  General Dyre resorted to extreme brutalities to suppress the  movement. His statement before the enquiry committee is a testimony of his sheer  brutality.  A child named Udham Singh was the witness of that massacre who later  took a vow to resort to unfailing retaliatory move. More than 350 people were  martyred and 1500 people were injured in the Jallianwala Bagh incident.  So, I  support this Bill which seeks to amend the Sections of this Bill. I rise to support the Jallianwala Bagh  National Memorial (Amendment) Bill, 2019.  It is essential to remember Sardar  Udham Singh ji on this occasion.  So, first of all, I would pay my homage to him  and to the martyrs of Jallianwala Bagh incident.  Through this Bill, we are not  taking such step which may cause any injustice to the people of this country. Our  Government has built many such memorials of several eminent persons but our  Government has never made a claim that member of such memorial trust would be  from our party.  We used to listen stories of the gory incident of Jallianwala Bagh  during our childhood days and I feel that Jallianwala incident was the only incident  which had shaken the whole nation. National memorial should be built on every  place which is related to the freedom struggle of our country.  There is also a need  to build a national memorial at Chhawani Shahid in my district.  The Government  has been definitely striving for running these institutions in an impartial manner.  I  feel that if these institutions are represented by the Government and the people  having history background, the functioning of such institutions could be  streamlined. This Parliament has been a witness to a large  number of debates on historical issues.  I would like to thank the Government of  India for inspiring the Parliament of the country to discuss the matters of historical  importance.  The national movement should not be dragged into the political  debate.  I would like to submit that the efforts should also be made to ensure that  the debate which is going on the historical issues does not turn into a farce.   History has so much vigour that no one can dare to change it.  I agree to the fact  that all the memorials of this country should be maintained by the Ministry of  Culture. The Dam Safety Bill has been presented in  Lok Sabha to ensure safety, proper monitoring, inspection and operation of dams  in the country and I appreciate such move.  The duties and functions of all the  committees proposed in the Bill have been defined. Through this Bill, water can be  supplied to water scarcity areas from those areas having excess of water so as to  address the problem of farmers. I have witnessed the flood situation in my  parliamentary constituency, Sheohar, Sitamarhi, Motihari districts of Bihar where  people have suffered loss of life and property which is quite painful.  There is a  need to construct dams for storage of water. The Government should hold positive  dialogue with the Government of Nepal so as to find a solution of the problem at  the earliest.  There is a provision to provide fund for relief measures under the  National Disaster Response Fund, but I urge that compensation for loss caused by  flood should be provided through the said fund.  The main concern related to large  dams is that these dams are not maintained properly.  Lakhs of people are living  around large and small dams across the country including my parliamentary  constituency, Sheohar.  It is matter of concern that about 75 per cent of the large  dams are more than 25 years old and about 150 dams are more than 100 years old.   I support this Dam Safety Bill presented by the Government in public interest from  the bottom of my heart. The first time the idea of bringing about a Bill  of this nature to protect the dams of this country originated in the year 1982. This  particular attempt, I am sure, will bear fruit because this particular Bill is brought  about under Article 246 of the Constitution of India read with Entry 56 and 91 of  List 1.  It is being argued by the Opposition that the Union Government does not  have the legislative competence to legislate on matters.  The Union Government  derives the legislative competence to legislate on all matters under Article 246 of  the Constitution of India.  The legislation is primarily to look after maintenance,  surveillance and safety of the dams and has nothing absolutely whatsoever in  controlling the ownership, controlling of water or any other such ancillary subjects  which the Opposition may have any fears over.  Two specific issues are attributed  to make this legislation imperative.  As per the CAG Report of 2017, only two  States, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, out of the 17States conducted a pre-monsoon  and post-monsoon audit on the safety of their dams.  As per the World Bank report  of 2002 most of the dam safety regulations are made at the federal level in the most  of the countries.  There are penal provisions in this Bill, which will enforce the  guidelines of the National Dam Safety Authority as well as the State Dam Safety  Organizations.  This Bill will be a more comprehensive legislation if consequent  penal provisions are also incorporated in this Bill to fix the accountability of errant  officials or errant owners of the dams. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code has been  successful in achieving its targets.  With the help of this Code, banks have been  able to increase the rate of recovery from 23 to 43 per cent from the insolvent  industries.  India's ranking has also seen improvement in the matter of insolvency.   This amendment Bill will help the authorities to take speedy decisions.   In terms  of insolvency, India ranked 134 which has since galloped to the 26th position.  Not  just that, even in terms of ease of doing business we have been able to move up  from 133rd position to 77th.   In the year, 2018 our country has been conferred  upon Global Restructuring Review award.  Coming to the Bill, earlier, it took four  years and three months the resolve cases of insolvency which has now been  reduced to 324 days.  As per the statistics available, out of the subjudice cases  under the I.B.C. as few as 32 per cent cases are older than 270 days.  It merits  attention here that earlier, there was binding of 270 days, yet a good number of  matters used to get stuck in court cases.  Seeing that, the timeline for the disposal  of all the disputes has since been extended to 330 days.  It is a very good step.  As  per the provisions of the Bill, NCLAT and DRT will have to accept or reject the  cases within 15 days.  At the top of it, if at all, there is a delay, reasons for the  same will have to recorded in writing.  It is a good move.  Further, Committee of  Creditors has been equipped with more rights.  There would be a single window  system to take care of the whole host of issues like restructuring, merger,  demerger, amalgamation etc.  The Government is supposed to formulate policies  and to provide conducive environment to the entrepreneurs enabling them to carry  out their function properly. Ours is the fastest growing economy in  the world.  Increase in NPAs of banks adversely affects development.  The  Government has brought this law to deal with this problem.  Hopefully this will  yield good results.  94 cases have been resolved under the Corporate Insolvency  Resolution Process till 31st March, 2019.  This is good that insolvency resolution  ranking of India for 2014 has improved from 134 to 108. I support the Bill. I slightly  disagree on suggestion of arbitration by a High Court Judge as they are already  overworked and the term 'eminent person' is so vague. 'Eminent person' is a very  relative term. I think there should be no ambiguity ever and no misuse of it.  The  qualification, experience and norms of accreditation of arbitrators shall be such as  specified in the Eighth Schedule. Provided the Eighth Schedule shall be deemed to  have been amended accordingly and Parliament really shall have no role once you  change it. Minister should clarify it for record. There are 3,28,000 cases pending in  arbitration. This could reduce litigation to a large extent. If you do want to do this  for ease of business, I think in a country like us we need it. In past we have lost  foreign investment due to litigations. I think this is a great intervention. The Arbitration Act, 1996 was amended by the  Act of 2015 to make the arbitration process smooth.  Therefore, the Government in  order to identify the road blocks in the development of arbitration institutions,  under the Bill of 2009 makes provision for Arbitration Council.  By making the  council \\u2019body corporate\\u2019 it raises certain queries about its nature.  Under it,  international persons will also become arbitrators.  Subject to the fact that there  should be no conflict of interest, parties could decide whoever they want as  arbitrators .  There certainly is a need to institutionalize the entire arbitration set up  in India.  Therefore, I support the Bill in its entirety. Government has been duly appreciated and duly  thanked for various landmark reforms.  The Government is working towards  establishing a settled law when it comes to the bankruptcy process.  The  governance is achieved when the rules are clear.   It is the job of the Government  to make the rules clear for the various players in the industry, in the economy, so  that everybody can conduct themselves accordingly. The Insolvency and  Bankruptcy Code has already been very successful. We have already seen 101  cases that have been withdrawn, 120 cases that have been resolved and 475 cases  that have been taken into liquidation.  So, the Code is working very well.  It will  enable us to meet our philosophy of \\u2018minimum government, maximum  governance\\u2019.  A very important aspect of this Bill is introducing many other  possibilities that were not allowed earlier such as mergers, amalgamations and de- mergers.  That will make this Bill work much more efficiently and take our  economy to 10 trillion. The names of legislations have changed,  decades have gone by and the entire Government machinery has been put to stop  this menace of NPAs, but not been able to contain this issue of rising NPAs.  You  have genuine business failure on the one hand and willful defaulters and malicious  failures on the other hand.  We need to differentiate these two.  In this whole  process, banks and lenders also have a very important role to play.  I believe that  the accountability with the banks needs to be much higher.  They have to do their  own survey and look at the state of the economy.  If banks are giving loans without  evaluating all of these factors, the NPAs will continue to go up.  If we do not  distinguish between genuine business failure and willful default, we will lose our  ability to innovate as a country and ultimately it will affect our growth.  I suggest  for consideration of the hon. Minister to provide one last opportunity to the debtor,  because our ultimate objective is to turn the business around and keep it running  and not to close the business.  Kindly look at this.  With these observations, I  support this Bill. I have risen here to support this  Bill.  The proposed amendments about porn are necessary.  Now, all children keep  mobile phones in their hands. The mobile phones have got numerous benefits but  they are equally harmful also.  Therefore, it was necessary to bring a stringent law  on pornography and it was also required to define it.  Last week, the Hon. Supreme  Court said that special Courts should be set up in each district for the disposal of  POCSO cases.  Last year, as many as 33,000 cases were registered in the country.   The Government is trying to purge the culture of the country through this Bill. I rise to support the Bill. Hon. Minister  deserves all laurels for bringing a comprehensive amendment to the Act.  One of  the new developments in this area is cyber world offences.  It is heartening to  know that \\u2018child pornography\\u2019 has been given a comprehensive definition, and it is  expected to take care of new challenges that we confront.  One aspect of the matter  deserves some kind of consideration. We have shifted this from \\u201ccommunal or  sectarian violence\\u201d to \\u201cviolence or during any natural calamity\\u201d.  Who will decide  this \\u201c\\u2026.. in similar situations\\u201d?  What is the \\u2018situation\\u2019? We leave too much to the  Trial Judge. This again needs to be considered.  These offences are mostly  committed in the child care institutions. The hon. Minister has to come out with a  comprehensive policy to shift attention from institutional care to non-institutional  care or alternative care so that less and less children are sent to these institutions.   You cannot divorce it from the POCSO Act and the Juvenile Justice Act because  these are parts of the same thing. We have to evolve a holistic approach.  My  request to the hon. Minister is that we should strengthen the preventive  mechanism.  I want some kind of death sentence of a very, very aggravated form  so that the life of the child is saved.  I would like to thank the Hon. Minister for  bringing this Bill on such a sensitive issue in the Parliament.  Several discussions  are taking place on Section 6 of the Principal Act in which there is an amendment  of death penalty and I wonder, why death penalty should not be there. In this  regard, the government deserves to be congratulated for showing so much of will  power to bring the provision of death penalty in the Act. I have a suggestion that  provisions should also be made in the Act against the persons committing  organized crime against the children. Unless the mindset of the society undergoes a  change, no law will become more successful. However, there is a need to bring  awareness and launch a campaign in the society that the children have to become a  good citizen in this country. We will be able to do something when their mindset is  healthy. Therefore, I would urge the Parliament to pass it. I will have a small  suggestion for the amendment. Section-1 and 2 of the Principal Act-3 in case of  amendment of Section-4, should be substituted because in my opinion you will  have to change it if not today then tomorrow. If it is amended it would be better  because if this problem is resolved as to how much money should be given to the  victim, the introduction of this Bill will become meaningful. First of all, I would like to  congratulate hon'ble Prime Minister and Minister of Women and Child  Development for introducing such sensitive matter with consensus.  All of us say  that there is a need to change the mindset of society, but it is necessary that we  should start this change with ourselves. When such issues are debated then all of us  want women to talk. Should it necessarily be a matter related to women?  I think  men should also raise such issues. Unless we change our mindset we cannot put  any good example in society. Rehabilitation of victim should certainly be  considered.  May we take certain initiative so that NGOs or Volunteers help  children to bring back their mental balance?  There should certainly be provision  for this purpose.  POCSO needs to be  implemented swiftly and also keeping in mind the sensitivity and care of survivors.   I have a few suggestions to the hon. Minister through you that a Child psychiatrist's  presence has to be made mandatory during each investigation to aid and advice  especially in cases of female victims, the questioning should be done under female  supervision.  Offenders are punished once but the victims are punished repeatedly  during the course of interrogation.  I support this Bill whole-heartedly. The demand for such a Bill was being  made for long time in the country.  First Nithari incident took place and thereafter  followed the Nirbhaya incident.  Sexual predators do not consider the age of  children and sexual crime against children of one to three years are also  committed.  I would like to congratulate the hon. Minister for introducing charges   in POCSO Act of 2012 and making provision of capital punishment therein.  This  Bill is certainly an important step to check the increasing incidents of sexual crime  against children.  I would like to congratulate the hon. Minister for setting up 1023  special fast track courts.  But safety of witnesses should also be taken care of. I support this Bill.  Today punishment of death penalty has been pronounced within 8 months of a rape  and murder case of 3 years 7 months old girl child under the POCSO Act.  This is  perhaps the first instance after the Act was enacted in the year 2012.  I welcome  the provision of 10 years of imprisonment to curb the menace of child pornography  and misuse of children for it, which was only seven years earlier.  I also welcome  the provision of 20 years of imprisonment for committing the crime of penetrative  sex against children below the age of 16 years.  The payment of compensation  should be made as soon as possible so that the children can get treatment.   Provision of psychological counselling should also be made.   I support the POCSO (Amendment) Bill.   This Bill increases the punishment for offenders which is justified.  I request the  Hon. Minister that nothing less than the death penalty should be awarded in case of  any sexual assault or unnatural act on a child less than the age  of 15 years.   This  Bill has also increased the punishment for using children for pornography.  Possessing any material related to child pornography should also be brought under  the category of offence.  A  law in this regard should be framed in our country also  as many other countries have a provision of 10 years imprisonment for possessing  such material. I rise to support Arbitration and Conciliation  (Amendment) Bill, 2019. The objective of this Bill is to provide fair and  transparent judicial system for the civil and commercial disputes outside the  Courts. India is a big market and the difficulties related to trade have decreased.  The economy of the country is consistently growing at rapid speed, therefore it has  become the centre of attraction. In view of the above there is a need of Modern  Dispute Redressal Law. 95 per cent of commercial disputes are being settled  through arbitration in the developed countries in the entire world. The Law  Minister with his utmost dedication made efforts to dispose of the cases of civil  and commercial nature and to make India an arbitration hub in the world in the  field of disposing of international trade disputes. The real objective of this Bill is  the appointment of arbitrators and the establishment of Indian Arbitration Council.  Recently, one hon. Member had discussed about the pending cases in the Courts in  India, therefore in present scenario these laws are needed. She had mentioned  about more than three crore cases. Out of these three crore cases 46 per cent cases  are such wherein Government Departments and Government Corporations are up  against each other. If we successfully settle those cases, the figure of three crore  would come down to one and a half crore. This Act would definitely enable the  creation of such structure of arbitration, which will reduce the dependency on court  and decrease the differences as well and will create a trade and development  friendly environment. Due to these effects this Act would prove a mile stone,  which would settle the domestic as well as international disputes as a result of  which India would become an international centre. Disputes relating to sharing of river water have  been going on in the country since the last 60-70 years.  The Article 262 clearly  states that the Parliament may by law provide for the adjudication of any dispute or  complaint with respect to the use, distribution or control of the waters of, or in, any  inter-State river or river valley.  Therefore, there shouldn't be any doubt that the  Government of India has no power to enact law on this subject.  There are about 20  big state basins of rivers in the country.  Our experience has been that the tribunals  have neither passed any award for many years nor any time limit relating to them  has been prescribed.  Earlier, all the tribunals had judicial members.  This time, the  Bill proposes that it will have judicial members as well as expert members also,  who will be of the level of chief engineer with experience of working on river  water disputes.  This is happening for the first time.  It is the need of the hour that  we constitute a permanent Tribunal so that the ever increasing number of inter- state river water disputes could be checked.  Further, I would like to ask the hon.  Minister whether the Government will review the Indus Water Treaty signed  between India and Pakistan in 1960 so that our country gets justice. This public property eviction law  was made in 1971 and it was brought again in 2017.  Today, it has been brought  again here and for that, I would like to thank honourable Minister.  Government  assets are for the execution of social obligations.  Through the amended law, it will  be possible for the new allottees to receive the government facility quickly. There  are many types of government assets in the country.  But, it is seen that people  illegally possess these assets for many years and it makes significant loss to the  revenue of the Government. My Parliamentary Constituency is Palghar.  The  population of that area has increased upto around 20 lakh. The city, Vasai-Virar  near Mumbai is also known as third Mumbai city. Illegal works are being done in  many places which are under Government control. We have to protect the  Government land.  So, I support this Bill. The unauthorized occupants in  the government accommodations are required to be evicted as per the provisions of  PPE Act, 1971.  This process generally takes very long time.  So, there was urgent  need for such an Act.  Hence, due to absence of any such Act, people stayed in the  government accommodations in unauthorized capacity and used to go to court in  case of getting notice from Estate officer.  These cases take very long time and  people continue their unauthorized stay in government accommodations.  There are  a number of merits in this Bill.  Unauthorized stay of people in government  accommodations also results in loss of revenue for the government.  The  government has to pay allowance to those who have not been allotted government  accommodations.  There are also cases of misuse of government accommodation  in Bihar.  But the present government has taken back these accommodations and  has used it for opening schools for the dalits and underprivileged people. I  rise to  support this Bill. Now, the  markets have become advanced as a result of which certain evils have also crept in  along with many good things.  Sometimes, the consumers are cheated.  This Bill  provides for a Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA). Earlier, district  forums were entitled to try the disputes of value of upto Rs. 20 lakh. Now, this  limit has been enhanced to Rs. 1 crore.  This Bill has a provision of mediation also.   The sellers should mandatorily give a bill for the sale and the goods can be  returned within a period of 1 month.  All the market committees and government  godowns should be equipped with electronic weighing machines for the benefit of  farmers. I rise to support this Bill. This Bill  has a new provision of class action suit. There is a provision of mediation also in  the Bill. E-commerce policy and Consumer Protection Bill are in conflict with each  other. I would like to know as to what will be the qualification of the judges.  Earlier, the forums at district level were entitled to try the disputes of value upto  Rs. 20 lakh.  It's good that now this limit has been enhanced to Rs. 1 crore. I rise to support the Consumer Protection Bill,  2019.  The object of this Bill is to protect the interests of the consumers.  The  entitlement of different consumer forums has been enhanced.  Besides, provision  of mediation as well as facility of registering online complaints is also there.  Now  many people are  using e-commerce.  This is also a big challenge before us.  This  Bill proposes to establish a Central Consumer Authority which will help us stop  unethical trade practices.  This Bill provides that in case a consumer gets a  favourable verdict from a district forum or the State Commission, the opponent  company does not have a choice to move the National Commission.  This Bill  provides the facility of hearing through video conferencing as well.  The  Government should address the issue of MRP also. I would definitely like to say that  this particular Bill if implemented well, will be a game-changer for consumers and  consumers interests in our country.  There are three major goals of this Bill. One is  to prevent violation of consumer rights, two is to check illegal trade practice, to  check illegal business ethics and the last one is to prevent misleading  advertisements.  We have been talking about different kinds of marketing,  misleading advertisements, tele-marketing, multi-level marketing, direct selling  and e-commerce pose new challenges to the consumers.  So, there is the need for  this kind of a Bill.  About 4,61,000 cases await disposal.  This is extremely  unfortunate.  So, we need quick disposal of cases. The Bill provides for several  provisions for simplifying the consumer dispute adjudication process.  This Bill is  very much pro-consumer.  We are talking of ease in filing.  The e-filing is there.   The mediation and product liability is there.  We all need to work together. This  comprehensive Bill is very much in the interest of consumers. On my own behalf and of my  Party, I sincerely thank the Government especially the Minister of Labour, Santosh  Gangwar for the Labour codes, 2019. You have taken a very big bold step. None of  the political party in power showed courage to change an old law which was  already in use before the independence. But, this Government has changed this old  law from the time of independence. This law used to comprise of 44 laws in the  code of conduct for Labour. Now, these laws will be merged into 4 codes. By  constituting the Advisory Board, the Government has fixed the wage of labourers  which is a good step for the welfare of the labourers. The best part of this Act is  that it has the provision to increase the employment opportunities for women and  the safety of women. There are about 40 to 42 crores of labourers in the  unorganized sector of the country.  To protect the interest of the labourers in  unorganized sector is a big challenge for the Government and all of us. You have  brought this effective law which will definitely benefit the labourers in  unorganized sector. Women also work in unorganized sector. There is a need to  make a provision for their safety. If someone violates the formula brought by you,  there should be strict provision for that. If the provision is weak then the employers  will escape by giving low wages. Therefore, strict action should be taken and there  should be a provision for punishment in that.  If there are less than 10 number of  employed labourers in an institution, the provision for them is not given in this  code. Small companies will try to employ seven to eight labourers and the rest as  contract labourers. You should take note of it. Finally, I would say that me and my  Party support the Labour Code, 2019 brought by you. The mechanism for fixing minimum  wages for workers is very complex in the country.  Even the workers are not aware  about the exact minimum wages fixed for them.  There is provision in the Bill to  restrict the kind component of wages maximum upto 15 per cent for workers  engaged in the plantation sector.  This is a historic step.  A number of minute  changes have been made in the new Code on Wages.  The issue of gender  discrimination has been addressed in this code.  Earlier, the workers had to  approach multiple authorities in case of non-payment of minimum wages.   Provision of single window mechanism has been introduced in this code on wages.   Provision for appellate authority has also been made in it.  The existing mechanism  for inspection is also very bad.  Provision for web based inspection has been made  therein.  I hope that through this Code on Wages workers will be benefitted and  there will be change in their lives. I congratulate the Hon. Minister for bringing this  Bill.  The Code on Wages Bill would abolish  the exploitative  labour laws of  British era and will lay foundation for a new India.  This Bill would be helpful in  ensuring ease of doing business and will give momentum to  Make in India  Programme also.   The most important point is that this Bill ensures minimum  wages to the workers employed in organized and unorganized sectors across the  country.   This Bill will increase the legislative protection of minimum wages from  existing 40% to 100% work force. A simplified wage code has been prepared by  subsuming the existing four Acts - the Payment of wages Act, the Minimum  Wages Act, the Payment of Bonus Act and the Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 into  this one.  I would like to mention about my Parliamentary Constituency that tea  gardens in this area are facing lot of problems. Tea gardens are on the verge of  closure and the condition of the workers employed in these gardens is very pathetic  though Minimum Wage Act is implemented here.  There is  a need to change  the  PLA Act, 1951 also. The Code on Wages Bill is a historical bill which would  ensure minimum wages and  timely payment of wages  to 50 crore labourers across  the country and will also ensure ease of living while promoting ease of doing  business.  This Bill would help in abolishing gender discrimination in the country.      *SHRI THOL THIRUMAAVALAVAN: This Code is aimed at  amalgamating four old labour laws into one.  Although I welcome this Code being  brought with a good intention and aim keeping in view the interests of the  labourers and to fix the minimum wage on the basis of a law, I wish to register my  concern that this is a move aimed to help the corporate and international                                                              * Original in Tamil  companies.  The Government has fixed the time period for revision of minimum  wages once in five years.  But this Bill remains silent about revision of floor wage  and the period of such a revision.  As this Bill is affecting the interests of the  labourers and workers of the country.  I request to send this Bill for the review  and  consideration of the Standing Committee. This is a very important Bill.  It aims at  bringing about massive improvement in the medical sector.  Shortage of qualified  doctors is an issue of grave concern.  It seems pertinent to mention in this context  that a good number of specialists are being appointed in each Sadar hospital at the  district level.  Thanks to the initiatives undertaken by the Government of Bihar in  order that all sorts of medical facilities may be available in the rural areas itself.   With the passing of the National Medical Commission Bill, I am sure there would  be qualitative changes in the field of medical education in terms of transparency,  accountability and of course in the monitoring of medical education in the country.   A host of initiatives have been made by the Government to increase the number of  seats in various medical educational institution/medical colleges.  The conduct of  final MBBS exams of all the medical colleges simultaneously and the provision  of  NEXT is a laudable step.  This will facilitate the students and they will not be  required to take the PG Admission Test separately.  Due to unavailability of any  direct train from my Parliamentary Constituency Gopalganj people are compelled  to journey by train to the metropolitan cities in pursuit of their treatment.  If a  medical college is set up at Gopalganj district in North Bihar, this will go a long  way in providing proper healthcare facility to those living in the rural areas of the  district.  Finally, I support the Bill.   This Bill is a very important Bill  because it is going to replace the Medical Council of India and a new National  Commission is being set up to improve the medical education in our country.  The  Bill also proposes to create four autonomous boards, which is a clear demarcation  of functions to regulate various aspect of medical education.  This would bring in  more transparency in selection process of Chairperson, Secretary and part time  members.  I would request the hon. Minister to clarify about the entrance exam to  what criterion will be there.  I would request the Minister that the practical exam  should not be taken in the same institute where the student is studying.  There  should be a completely transparent process so that there does not exist any chance  of bias. The amendments  proposed to the Company Law seek to tighten corporate social responsibility  compliance and reduce the load of cases on National Company Law Tribunal.  The  proposed legislation is intended to address the difficulties faced by stakeholders  and ease of doing business in order to promote growth and employment.  In the  interest of transparency and fairness, guiding principles for determination of  penalties have been introduced, which would help the companies to a large extent.   It is hoped that the change in the provisions of the Act will bring about a change in  the way the corporate world works.  Apart from that, under the amended law, non- maintenance of registered office and non-reporting of commencement of business  would be the grounds for striking off the name of a company from a register.  The  amendments are aimed at filling critical gaps in the Corporate Governance and  Compliance Framework as well as simultaneously extended great ease of doing  business to law-abiding corporates. Elections in our country commenced in the  year 1952.  We have been observing elections since the election to the first Lok  Sabha in the country that voting percentage has been very low.  For the first time,  in the recent elections, the voting percentage has gone upto 65 to 70 per cent which  has never been the case in the last many years.  This became possible because of  good election management by the Election Commission.  In my parliamentary  constituency of Jhalawar-Baran, we could reach upto  72 per cent voting for the  first time.  But here I need to say that if we make voting compulsory it would be an  infringement on our democratic rights. (Speech unfinished)  The discussion was not concluded.        SNEHLATA History is being created today  which would figure in golden letters in the annals of our Parliament. Hon. Supreme  Court has directed the Parliament in this matter twice in the past. Firstly, in Shah  Bano case and now in Shayara Bano case.  This is the difference of two  Governments.  This Government is competent enough to enact a law against the  triple talaq to give freedom to our sisters in the country after 72 years of  Independence.  A sincere effort is being made to give justice to all Muslim sisters  with a sense of duty, equity and equality.  Therefore, the Government deserves our  kudos.  Such a longstanding social evil needs to be removed through enactment of  law and not through society.  This was mandated by hon. Supreme Court and this  must be the duty of the politicians. The Government has decided to support  the Supreme Court Judgment through this Bill and this is an admirable cause. The  hon. Law Minister has pointed out that more than 200 cases have come even after  the Supreme Court\\u2019s Judgment which is really alarming.  It seeks to deter Muslim  husbands from whimsically divorcing their wives.  If passed, the Bill shall provide  equality to women that the Constitution of India mandates and the hon. Supreme  Court recommends. Marriage is a civil contract. We feel that divorce-related  offences under it should not be criminalized unless they can be linked to domestic  violence.  The Act of triple Talaq will result in imprisonment upto three years for  the husband, there is no clear provision as to how the incarcerated person will  provide maintenance to the wife.  The Bill should include a provision giving  women the option to ratify a marriage annulment and claim the maintenance under  this Bill.  Society today is moving towards decriminalizing certain things and  improving inter-personal relationships.  Section 377 has been decriminalized.  So,  let  us think beyond party lines and political agendas.     Muslim women have so far had no say in  the talaq-e-biddat practice of divorce in Muslim personal law. This Bill seeks to  change that, and I extend full credit to this Government for taking heed of the  issue.  All the Muslim countries have imposed ban on the practice of instant triple  Talaq.  The Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan conducted a national survey in  2015 and found that 92.1 per cent of Muslim women backed a total ban on oral or  unilateral divorce. It is now time for India to take this step.  I also support the  Government\\u2018s effort to criminalize a void verbal statement because it sends a  message that a wife is not a disposable commodity.  We have to realize that this  practice is an easy bail out for all other evils too, such as dowry, domestic violence  or even infidelity.  This Bill is about women\\u2019s rights.  Do not make it about  religion.  I would exhort the Minister to launch nationwide campaign and spread  awareness about the practice of triple Talaq being null and void now for the  uneducated Muslim women. Marriage is a sacred institution.  By  entering into matrimonial alliance with a person, one is supposed to be with each  other through thick and thin.  The religion has to move forward in consonance with  the changing paradigm of society.  Social reforms have to be espoused to keep  progressing.  Prevention is always better than cure.  In a way, the provisions  contained in the Bill are of preventive nature.  So, we must support it.  This Bill  has been brought for the sake of upholding the esteem of women and gender  equality.  It is not that the incidents of triple talaq are witnessed only among the  illiterate gentry.  The fact remains that well educated women are also subjected to  this evil practice.  I am of the opinion that progress of women is a must for the  progress of the nation.  So, a law for equality is imperative.      I think all of us need to commend  the efforts of the Government and the hon. Prime Minister for having shown the  courage of come up with this king of Bill. This has been debated upon and the  suggestions that have been worthwhile have been incorporated. This Bill is a  logical culmination of the verdict given by the hon. Supreme Court in Shayara  Bano case on 22nd August, 2017. It very clearly held that talak-e-biddat violated  constitutional morality. It is definitely a non-bailable offence, but there is  conditional bail. Of course, there is the issue of allowance also. The Shah Bano  case would not have happened had this Act there at that point of time. Of course,  there is the issue of custody of children also. It is a great thing that the custody  issue has also brought in here. In this Parliament, there have been legislation  against dowry and sati, then what is the problem about this particular thing that we  are talking about. I would just like to make a remark. When men are oppressed, it  is a tragedy. But when women are oppressed, it is a tradition. This is not  acceptable. This is a historic moment for all  of us because this Bill will give Muslim women equality and a dignified life, which  is their well-deserved right. There are various laws as Section 3 of the Dowry  Prohibition Act, 1961, Section 498A of IPC and Section 17 of the Hindu Marriage  Act, 1956 which prescribe imprisonment of the Hindu men. You are crying for the  provision of imprisonment of the Muslim Men. It is a matter of oppression,  exploitation and injustice. It is a tool to deprive the crores of Muslim sisters of  their right to equality. The Muslim women need liberation not only from Triple  Talaq, but from crimes like polygamy and Halala also. The countries like Turkey,  Pakistan, Bangladesh, Syria, Iraq, Sudan and Libia have freed their women from  Triple Talaq. It is easy for anybody to just give up this issue, as has been done in  the past. Now, the Government led by Shri Narendra Modiji is committed to  discharge its duty. Five Muslim women including Ishrat Jahan are fighting against  the issue of Triple Talaq. Ishrat Jahan is from West Bengal. The Muslim men are  insulting Ishrat Jahan in West Bengal despite it is being ruled by a woman Chief  Minister.    We need to take stringent action  against the terrorists activities in the country.  This amendment Bill will strengthen  the National Investigation Agency which remains always vigilant for the security  of the country.  The previous Governments could not be so much successful in  containing the terrorism.  Those Governments brought a number of Acts like  MISA, TADA, MCOCA, POTA etc. but this Government has been successful in  its endeavour to curb terrorist activities.  It is the first time ever in the history of  this country that the Minister of Home Affairs was received with  open arms in  Jammu and Kashmir.  It is because people have faith in the Prime Minister and the  Minister of Home Affairs.  This amendment will help the authorities to confiscate  the property of a terrorist.  There were a number of channels through which  economic assistance was provided to the terrorists and there was an urgent need to  restrict the activities of such people.  There was a need to take legal action not only  against an organisation but also an individual.  This amendment Bill will help in  doing all these things.  My suggestion is that appropriate changes should be  brought about in the legal provisions to check the delay caused by the judicial  process. We must take all the necessary steps to  maintain the sovereignty and integrity of the country. Our Government believes in  the policy of zero tolerance. Stringent law must be there to arrest the culprits.  There is no ill will in this. The Bill has been brought only to simplify the  procedure. Amendments have been brought to strengthen the investigating  agencies. Terrorism is spreading its tentacles in all over the world. Today there are  so many countries in the world which are badly affected by terrorism.  This Bill is  in the interest of the country, therefore, I support this Bill. I rise to support this Bill.  We all should understand that this Bill is against the terrorists. Stringent laws  create fear in the minds of the criminals. Strict decisions of the Government have  resulted in mitigation of terrorist activities in the country. I support this Bill. It is a historic step to  stop corruption. As per CBI 68 thousand crore rupees have been collected from 6  crores of people in the country through illegal schemes. There are many provisions  to take action against such individuals but they escape because of loopholes in the  law. In this law, strict provision has been made.  Punishment and penalty has been  increased. In these schemes, mostly the poor people from villages fall into the trap.  Scams are done by bringing different schemes. The companies show such dreams  that the people fall into their trap. Through this Bill, illegal deposit schemes and  black money can be restricted to a large extent. The Government is constantly  working for the interests of the common people of the country. At the outset, I would like to thank the  Government for formulating a series of laws against terrorists, financial defaulters   and enemies of humanity.  I rise to support this Unlawful Activities (Prevention)  Amendment Bill.  Terrorism emanates from different sets of horrific ideology and  hence we need different laws to fight this menace.  Some of my colleagues raised a   question on the necessity of a stringent law.  For the reasons of the law being weak  in nature, such a milieu of fear and terror has engulfed this country that no one  feels safe today.  So, laws need to be framed commensurate with the gravity of  crime.  Those need to be proclaimed as terrorists who extend assistance, support  and finance to the terrorists.  Only by doing so we can stop the terrorists outfits  from spreading their tentacles.  This Bill provides for a definitive time frame for  the completion of the investigation of crimes related to terrorism.  The question is  whether we can bring in such a law that will ensure time bound trial even in court.   Terrorism being a national problem, it must be dealt with at the national  level. I rise to speak in favour of this Bill.  There are  hundreds of such examples in Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Maharashtra and  Karnataka where several families have been ruined.  The Reserve Bank of India  has said that it cannot regulate anybody apart from N.B.F.C. and banks. These  people always find out the escape route for every legislation. Security and  Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has submitted about Saradha Group in the year  2009 that it is a scam and it should be checked.  Thereafter SEBI has started  investigation into the matter and submitted its report to the Ministry of Corporate  Affairs in the year 2010 stating that it is a major scam and action should be taken  in this regard but nothing such happened.  The said Group had given motorcycles  to Kolkata Police under CSR.  If a Group has good relation with leaders and  bureaucrats then do you think that investigation into the matter will be conducted?   Similarly Rose Vally scam had also taken place in which an amount of Rs. 60,000  was involved. But I would like to state that the Government has presented the Bill  in view of all the above mentioned situations.  We have to consider the Bill rising  above our Party lines so that action should be taken against such scamsters and  these persons involved in it should be sent behind bars. I rise to support Motor Vehicles  (Amendment) Bill, 2019.  Motor Vehicles Act was enacted 30 years before and so  much changes have taken place during last 30 years.  Therefore, there was a need  to amend this Act.  Road connectivity, people's safety, timely treatment, insurance,  compensation, simplification of transport related procedures and other things have  been kept in mind in this Bill.  Amendments have been made in this Bill in the  matters related to passengers, freight, operation, driving license, insurance etc.  So  many new provisions have been made in this Bill about security.  Road accidents  take place due to wrongly issued driving licenses. There is a loss of 3 per cent of  GDP every year due to road accidents.  Therefore, there is a need to control these  accidents.    It is very unfortunate that 1.5 lakh people die in  around 5 lakh road accidents that takes place in the country every year.  Various  other problems also existed in the transport industry.  People have to face various  difficulties in getting licence at RTO.  Now, under the able leadership of hon.  Prime Minister, this Government has strived hard to overcome this difficult  situation and it seems that India is scaling new heights to become a modern nation  in the fields of roads and transport by implementing innovative ideas and projects.   With a great pride, I can say that now it is possible to cover the distance between  my parliamentary area Karauli and Dholpur in one and a half hour only whereas  earlier it used to take 5 hours to cover the same.  Through this Bill, this  Government has provided for online registration and driving licence as a step  towards building a nation free from corruption.  This will also modernise the  process involved in issuing driving licence and vehicle registration in India.  Apart  from that, provisions have also been made under this Bill  to link Aadhaar card  with driving licence and vehicle registrations.  This will also eliminate the problem  of fake licences.  It is a very important Bill associated with the lives of the people  of this country.  This also shows that our Government is committed under the able  leadership of hon. Prime Minister.  Under this Bill, provisions have been made that  if a minor is caught driving the vehicle and is involved in any accident or violation  of any rule then his parents or the vehicle owner shall be held responsible for his  act. I rise to speak in support of the Motor  Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, 2019 which seeks to replace the Motor Vehicles  (Amendment) Act, 1988.  It contains several good provisions which will go a long  way in making India's road safer.  I appreciate the provision of providing cashless  treatment to the road accident victims which will help in saving a lot of lives.  The  Government should take the State Governments also on board in its bid to  implement provisions of this Bill.  I want to ask the Government whether the  electronic monitoring of the road safety would be done on the National Highways,  State Highways or the urban roads.  The Government should also clarify as to who  is going to bear the cost of this electronic monitoring of the road safety: Is it the  Central Government or the State Government?  Moreover, the Road Safety Board  should have all the power  to look into the compliance, monitoring of the  compliance and levy penalties.    This amendment Bill is a good step   towards the road safety.  I would like to urge the Government that a stern action  should be taken against the officers issuing driving licence to an untrained person.   I would like to suggest the Government in this regard.  There should be a provision  for strict examination before issuing licence to the drivers and prior to it intensive  training should be ensured for them.  The act should have the provisions to punish  the contractors who are found guilty of showing laxity in the construction and  upkeeping of the roads. At the same time, the responsibility of higher officers  should also be fixed.  A world class Driver Training Institute should be set up in  every district keeping in view the shortage of drivers in our country.  The CSR  fund should be utilised for this purpose.  I would like to thank the Government for  promoting the use of non-conventional energy and at the same time getting people  rid of environment pollution by exempting electronic vehicles from taxes. In the first place, I, on behalf of my  party, welcome you with all my heart. It is a matter of pride that you will steer this  House for a period of five years occupying the chair of Hon. Speaker and all of us  will receive your invaluable guidance.  There are a number of parties in this House  with merely one, two or three Members and my party is no different on this count  that has only two elected Members.  The implication is that small parties like ours  need your protection the most in order that we may get ample opportunity to put  forward our views through you.  Hon. Prime Minister has elaborated on your  exposure to Parliamentary practice at length, I do not wish to reiterate the same.  I  am fully confident that the great legacy of our first hon. Speaker Shri G.V.  Mavlankar and the legacy of his successesors would be further strengthened in  your tenure.  Alongside, all of us would recieve an encouragement to strengthen  Parliamentary democracy by way of your guidance.  On behalf of my party, I  assure you to extend my whole-hearted support in the smooth conduct of the  business of the House. I just wish to witness an enhanced glory of this House in  your illustrious tenure. Whenever you sit on the Chair, we feel  proud.  Our Government has done so many things in the interest of the people and  the country.  Yesterday, portrait of late Atalji was inaugurated.   His memory has  been preserved forever in the Central Hall.  India is the largest democracy of the  world. We have to make this democracy more strong and for that the Opposition  and treasury benches will have to move ahead together.  You have given me and  all other Members the opportunity to express our opinion without any partiality. Some of the people suddenly get  hyperactive whenever the issue of chit fund or ponzi scheme is raised.  The entire  country is aware that the Left Front Government of the West Bengal brought in  this Bill to ban this scheme in 2002.  If the erstwhile Union Government had  acceded to that Bill, such a large number of persons would not have lost  their  money.  Therefore, I would like to support and thank the hon. Finance Minister for  bringing in this Bill.  I would like to make a demand that appropriate measures  should be taken to return the money to the poor people. The Hon. Speaker, Madam, gave me  opportunities to speak on behalf of my party on all issues. She conducted the  House in an orderly manner.  I congratulate and thank her for this.  I congratulate  the hon. Prime Minister also who gave the slogan, \\u2018Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas\\u2019 and  \\u2018Corruption Free India\\u2019. I am in favour of this Bill.  The middle class  and the poor have been widely affected by such chit funds.  A Srijan scam has  taken place in our State which needs to be discussed.  This Bill brought in by the  hon. Minister is a welcome move. This Bill has been brought in with a view to  amending the Rules to Jallianwala Bagh Memorial Committee Trust.  It is not a  celebration.  When Sikhs were being subjected to assault way back in 1984, our  leader Bala Sahab had strictly warned not to hurt the Sikhs even to the least degree.   I welcome the Amendments moved by the Government.  Jallianwala Bagh is not  associated with any particular religion, faith or even a state for that matter.  This  episode inflicted pain across the country.  I support the Amendments moved  relating to the trustees of  Jallianwala Bagh Memorial Committee. It is a very difficult task to conduct  the business in the House.  But, you made successful attempt in running the House  in the best possible manner.  Hon. Prime Minister also made efforts to carry  everyone along.  Therefore, I congratulate him.  Everyone should participate in the  discussion in the House and everyone should also ensure that the House runs  smoothly.   This Parliament is a great institution.  I  congratulate our Hon. Prime Minister for the passage of various important Bills.   The job of the Speaker is very difficult.  I represent the Other Backward Castes of  India. I only hope today that in the next Lok Sabha and in the subsequent Lok  Sabhas, the voices of the marginalized section of society will be heard.  India has  seen a tremendous leader and a dynamic Prime Minister in Narendra Modi Ji and  we have more of him to see in future. During the last five years, our Government  has been implementing the policies for the benefit of the villages, the poor, the  farmers, the exploited, the downtrodden, the middle class and the students and this  budget is the ultimate compliment to these policies.  This discussion is on the  Finance Bill, however, my predecessor was speaking on budget.  Such irrelevant  discussions dent the image of politicians.  Yesterday, the Floor Leader of a party  was saying that the Government is not releasing the report on black money  whereas the fact is that the Members of the Finance Committee can access the said  report.  The Economic Survey of 2004 said that the Vajpayee Government had  given a robust economy to the country.  The Economic Survey of 2014 says that  the preceding Government had left the economy of the country in a bad shape.   The Congress Party is constantly quoting the name of HAL whereas this is only a  company.  When the Modi Government came to power, it immediately constituted  the SIT  on black money.  The reason for black money generation in the country  was that the rates of income tax used to be very high.  If we want to develop, we  have to make our country a tax paying country.  MSME Sector has got the  maximum benefits from this Finance Bill.  This is the first Government ever to  thank the tax payers.  The theory of 'One Nation One Tax' is not a new theory but  we have got a Prime Minister for the first time who could implement this theory in  the form of GST.  This Finance Bill is going to benefit the middle-class, the poor  and the villages.  With these words, I support this Bill.  By allocating more Budget for 13 Ministries especially  related with public affairs under this Finance Bill 2019-20, the Government has  shown its farsightedness.  In this country, it has been tried to provide assistance to  12 crore farmers through Pradhan Mantri Samman Nidhi.  The Government has  provided soil health card and brought 22 crops for the first time under Minimum  Support Price and increased it by 50 to 90 per cent.  Shram Yogi Yojana has been  introduced under which when a labourer is rendered incapable after 60 years of  age, he/she will get a pension of at least Rs. 3000/-.  For the first time this  Government has paid attention towards the Development of rural infrastructure and  under Pradhan Mantri Sadak Yojana a budget of Rs.19 thousand crore has been  allocated by covering 98 percent of the small villages and dhanis.  Through Mudra  Scheme girls have been made self reliant without any capital security guarantee.   About 50 crore poor Indians were not able to get medical treatment.  Ayushman  Bharat Scheme is such a scheme of India in the world under which each poor will  get medical treatment.  The middle class will get a tax rebate of income upto Rs.5  lakh.  For the first time provision for providing reservation to economically weaker  sections of the upper caste has been made.  Entire India has got a new direction  through this Budget.  This Budget will prepare new infrastructure for the  development of this country and will uplift the poor people of lower class.   I congratulate the hon. Minister of  Finance for understanding the issues of the middle class salaried people and  providing them maximum relief. Hence forth, person having annual income upto  Rs. 5 lakh will be exempted from paying any tax. Approximately three crore  existing tax payers will be benefited by it. Standard deduction has been raised from  Rs. 40 thousand to Rs. 50 thousand. It is a commendable step. The abundance of  benefits notwithstanding the revenue generation through income tax is estimated to  be approximately Rs. 13 lakh 80 thousand crore by the year 2020. I thank the hon.  Prime Minister for the code of conduct of 'Collective Efforts Inclusive Growth'  (Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas). The present Government is working  with a mission for the bright future of this country.  People from across the world  have come and taken a holy dip in the ongoing \\u2018Kumbh Mela\\u2019 and everyone is  saying that 80 percent water of the Ganga river has become pollution free.  Couple  of years earlier no one could ever imagine that the same Ganga would be flowing  uninterrupted and be pollution free.  Earlier yoga was not so popular but now the  world has accepted that Yoga is the contribution and a gift of India to the world.   The International Day of Yoga has been accepted by the whole world.  When this  Government came in power in 2014, the youth and farmers of the country were  feeling let down everywhere. There was feeling of desperation in people  everywhere.  But today India is being recognized worldwide.  The Government has  taken many steps like rolling out Swachch Bharat Mission, constructing toilets,  launching Jan-Dhan Yojana and opening medical colleges etc.  Earlier there were  just three medical colleges in my Parliamentary Constituency Jharkhand in the last  50-60 years but now 8 medical colleges have been opened within the span of four  years only.  Even AIIMS has been opened there.  Roads have been constructed in  every village under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana.  All this instilled a sense  of confidence in the farmers and the youth.  So, now India is going to be  prosperous in future and became world Guru once again. The budget of  our government under the leadership of the hon'ble Prime Minister is a growth  oriented budget. Central Government is going to implement \\\"Pradhan Mantri  Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana\\\" to provide annual financial assistance of Rs. 6,000/-  to the 12 crore farmers having landholding of up to two hectares. Income up to Rs.  5 lakh has been made tax free. Labourers in the unorganised sector would be  provided monthly pension of Rs. 3000/- after completing the age of 60, for which  they have to make contribution of Rs. 100 per month. Gokul Mission Scheme has  been launched to promote animal husbandry in the rural areas. Budget allocation of  Rs. 3 lakh crore has been made for the defence sector, out of which maximum  amount is proposed to be utilized for procurement of new defence equipments. The budget of our Government is  based on the principle of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' and it is every person's budget.  It is budget of the poor, young people, farmers, middle class, small traders. It is a  budget of more than 3.5 crore middle class families. It is a budget of more than 12  crore farmers and 30 crore workers. It is a budget with right intention and a budget  for building a new India. The Government has increased MSP by 1.5 times and has  worked to ensure the availability of urea to farmers. The Government have started  Pradhan Mantri Kissan Samman Nidhi (PM-Kissan). The Government has  increased allocation of National Gokul Mission to Rs. 750.00 crores. It has been  decided to provide 2% rebate on interest to farmers engaged in Animal Husbandry  and Fishery. In case of natural calamity the farmers are unable to repay their loans,  their loans would be rescheduled and it has been decided to extend 2 per cent  interest rebate for the first year of the rescheduled loan. Maximum number of  soldiers in our Armed Force and Para Military Forces hails from my Parliamentary  Constituency, Jhunjhunu.

Today, around 2 crore 47 lakh households have been provided with  electricity connection under Pradhan Mantri Soubhagya Yojana. The last budget of 16th Lok Sabha  is a prosperity and development oriented budget. When India celebrates its 75th  year of independence each and every one will have toilet facility, electricity, water  sewage connection and the farmers will have double income and it will be caste,  dynasty and terrorism free and an empowered country. We have reined in inflation.  We have brought in a radical change in the field of taxation by paving way for  Goods and Service Tax (GST). We have initiated a new era of transparency. We  have run a corruption free Government. The budget is going to prove a revolutionary  step for development and uplift of all sections of the society. The Pradhan Mantri  Kisan Sampada Yojana, one Rank-One-Pension Scheme for the defence personnel,  Skill Development Scheme and Khelo India for the youth are the major initiatives  of the Government. India has ranked 5th  in defence power with setting up 108  satellites in the space. I welcome these measures undertaken by the Government. The Government is moving forward to realise  the dream of 'New India' by the year 2022. Our economy is the fastest growing  economy in the word and achieved highest growth rate in these 5 years since the  economic reforms started in 1991. Today, India is the 6th largest economy. The  Government has successfully achieved highest growth rate, controlled two digit  inflation and maintained fiscal balance. India has also attracted huge FDI  amounting nearly 239 billion USD during the last 5 years. Last 5 years have seen  the fast infrastructural reforms and have paved the path for higher growth rate for  many coming decades. I am happy to know that the 22th AIIMS is going to be set- up in Haryana. Targeted development works are being carried out in 115 most  backward districts under Aspirational District Programme. For the first time, the  MSP of all 22 crops was announced at least 50% more than their input cost.

The Government has  taken decision to set up a separate department for fishery. New Pension Scheme  has been more libralised by increasing the share of government from 10% to 14%  while retaining the employees' share of 10%. The minimum wage for all category  employees has also increased by 42%.  42 crore workers of the un-organised sector  contribute nearly 50% in the total GDP of the country. The Government has  proposed to initiate a comprehensive pension programme named Pradhan Mantri  Shram Yogi Maandhan for these workers of unorganised sector. The Government  has also proposed to set up a Welfare Development Board under Social Justice and  Empowerment Ministry with the aims to implement welfare and development  programmes meant for denotified, nomadic and semi-nomadic communities. More  than 1 crore youths are being trained under PM Kaushal Vikas Yojana so that they  may earn their livelihood. All these efforts have made India world's second largest  start-up hub. The government has envisaged a national programme for Artificial  Intelligence and allied technologies so that its benefits reach masses. Many  effective measures have been taken to strengthen the small and medium  enterprises. The government has set up government e-market place two years ago.  The total transaction amounting Rs. 17,500 crore has been done through this GeM  and has resulted in average of savings of 25% to 28%. It is for the first time that  defence budget for 2019-20 is going to cross the Rs,3,00,000 crore. Now more than  100 airports are operational in the country. Domestic air traffic has grown two  times in the last 5 years. India has become fastest highways developer country in  the world. The railway passengers are getting world classes facilities with the  operation indigenously designed and manufactured semi-high speed train Vande- Bharat Express. The people of North-East region are also getting the benefits of  infrastructure development. The government is going to start containers cargo  transportation in the North-Eastern region through Brahmaputra by improving  navigation capacity of the river. For the first time, Arunachal Pradesh has made its  place on civil aviation map and Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizorm on India's railway  map. Now, India has become the largest data consumption country in the world.  The number of companies manufacturing mobile and mobile components has  increased from 2 to 268. The government has reduced the tax rate. The  implementation of GST of undoubtedly the biggest tax reform after independence.  The government in committed to wipeout the evil of black money. The  development in our government has transformed into mass movement. My  constituency Misrikh is one of the most backward areas in the country. It needs fast  development work. Last year also, I made a demand to construct an embankment  on the left bank on the river Ganga flowing from my constituency. There is a need  to construct ROBs and RUBs on all the unmanned level crossings there.   PROF. SAUGATA ROY: This year unemployment is at an all-time 45  years high, at 6.1 per cent.  National Sample Survey Organization data has not  been published.  The Government is not allowing them to publish the data on  unemployment which is at a very bad state.  Total Non-Performing Assets of the  banks have crossed rupees 11 and a half crore, an all-time high.  The Government  has not been able to bring back the people who fled with bank\\u2019s money.  The  Interim Finance Minister has presented an \\u2018Account for Votes\\u2019.  This is only a  vote-oriented Budget.  The Government has tried to apply \\u2018betadine\\u2019 to the wounds  created by demonetization.  Ultimately, the Government has not been able to bring  back black money into the system.  The Government has gone on changing the tax  rates as a result of which the GST collection this year is Rs. one lakh crore which  is less than  the previous budged.  The Andhra people have a justified demand for a  special category status, but that is not being listened to.  I would urge the  Government to announce something about it.  The Government has announced  Rs.6000 per year per family which comes to Rs.500 per month and Rs.17 per  family per day.  It is too little and too late.  Provident Fund-linked Pension Scheme  too does not sound promising at all. The Government has presented an  expansionary Budget and prioritized populism over fiscal prudence.  This Budget  is not showing any direction to the country.  The Government is not capable of  delivering a good economic system.  I oppose this Budget. I am thankful that you have given me the  opportunity to speak on the Interim Budget dedicated to \\\"Prosperous Farmer  Healthy India\\\". Our Government has been successful in checking the double digit  inflation. Our Government has introduced a scheme to provide minimum income  of Rs. 6000 per annum to provide relief to small and marginal farmers. Our  Government has recovered three lakh crores rupees from big defaulter companies.  Electricity will be provided to all the 2.5 crores houses till March 2019, which are  deprived of it. The work of Saubhagya scheme is almost complete. The  Government has announced to increase the limit of gratuity from 10 lakh rupees to  20 lakh rupees.  Rupees 3000 per month will be given to the employees of  unorganised sector. Undeclared income of 1.30 lakh crore rupees has been detected  through steps taken by the Government including demonetisation to check the evils  of black money. There is a proposal to double the income tax rebate by increasing  it upto five lakh rupees to provide relief to middle class people. Three crore middle  class taxpayers will be benefitted by this proposal. The farmers who are facing  natural calamities will be given two percent interest subsidy and the farmers who  are repaying the loan in time will be given three percent interest subsidy to  overcome the crises in agricultural sector. The Government will provide 750 crore  rupees to help animal husbandry and fisheries. The Minimum Support Price for 22  notified crops has been fixed 50 percent more than the input cost. The Government  has sanctioned 15.56 lakh loans of 7.23 lakh crores of rupees under Mudra Yojana  and a major part of its beneficiaries are women. Six crore gas connections have  already been provided to poor women out of eight crore free LPG connections  under Ujjwala Yojana. At present 100 airports are operational in the country and  the traffic has doubled during the last five years. India is at the forefront in the  world in developing the highways. All the unmanned level crossings have been  abolished. A national programme on artificial intelligence will be introduced to  provide the benefit of artificial intelligence and the related technology to the  people. India has become the  maximum mobile data user country in the world.  One lakh villages will be made digital during the next five years. I believe that  equal focus has been given to all the sectors from agriculture to the basic  infrastructure in this Budget. This budget is beneficial for farmers and the common  men. This Budget shall empower the  poor, strengthen the farmers, honour the labourers and fulfil the dreams of the  middle class.  This Budget will enhance the purchasing power of the middle class.   The IMF report of the year 2018 acknowledges India as the fastest growing  economy among the emerging economies of the world.  The global performance of  the country has increased and we have climbed to 71st position from 142nd position  in ease of doing business.  The gratuity limit along with income tax has been raised  from 10 lakh to 20 lakh rupees for common man.

More than Rs. 6 crore have been allocated for the Railways and no  increase has been made in the passenger fare.  All unmanned crossings on  broadgauge network have been removed.

More than Rs.  93 thousand crore and Rs. 11 thousand crore have been allocated for Shiksha  Yojana and Mid Day Meal Scheme respectively.  35.6 per cent and 28 per cent  increase has been made in the budgetary allocation for the Scheduled Castes and  Scheduled Tribes category respectively. Our Government has, in the Interim Budget taken  care of every section of the country.  By providing relief to the farmers, labourers  and tax payers in the budget, our Government has opened new doors of  development for these people.  Prior to 2014 General Elections, the farmers, the  poor people, the labourers and the backward classes were struggling for their  existence and inflation had overburdened the common citizen.  In 2014 General  Elections, the people voted in favour of Bharatiya Janata Party Government and  showed faith in it regarding creation of a new India.  Our Government has stepped  up fast in the direction of fulfilling the dreams of new India.  Our Government, in  its tenure of four and a half years, prepared its schemes keeping in view every  section of the country and implemented it effectively.  Our Government has made  arrangement like housing, insurance, gas connection for the poor and Soil Health  Card for the farmers.  All facilities have been provided to the farmers, students,  people working in unorganised sector, housewives and people belonging to the  working class so as to ensure all-round development of the country.  The  Government has launched Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Scheme.  Under  this scheme, Rs. 6000/- per year will be provided to those farmers who are having  less than 2 hectares of land holding.  Now India has become the world's sixth  largest economy whose GDP is likely to be around 8%.  2% exemption in loans  will be given to the farmers in case of natural calamities and 3% in case the  farmers who repay their loans on time.  Kamdhenu Yojana has been launched for  the protection of cows.  An amount of 750 crore rupees is likely to be spend on this  scheme.  Bonus, being given to the soldiers of the country, has been increased from  Rs. 3500 to Rs. 7000/-.  The honorarium of all workers, working under Anganwadi  Scheme has been increased by 50%.

Women are the  biggest beneficiaries of Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.  The Government has  made announcement to provide maternity leave of 26 weeks to working employees  of the Central Government.  The Government has made announcement regarding  allocation of 60,000 crore rupees for MGNREGA. The Government will convert  one lakh villages into digital villages over the next five years.  During the last four  and a half years, our Government has run a corruption free Government which is  committed only for development of the country. The Government under the leadership of Shri  Narendra Modi has given free LPG connections to 6 crore families.  Now, it has  been announced in the Budget that 2 crore more families will be given free LPG  connections.  A  pension scheme has been announced  for 10 crore labourers  working in the unorganised sector .  The Government will deposit Rs.2000 in the  accounts of farmers directly before 31st March.  I wish to extend my thanks to the  hon. Finance Minister for all these things.  Senior citizens were paying TDS on  bank interest.  In this budget that interest of Rs.10,000 has been enhanced upto  Rs.40,000.  Reserve Bank has reduced .25 BPS interest rate.  It means that lakhs of  home buyers have been benefited.  In the end, I would like to say that this is the  only Government which fights for the poor.    This is a very progressive budget.  Many provisions have been made to make farmers prosperous. Farmers engaged in  animal husbandry and fisheries have been given three percent rebate on interest  rate. Small farmers having a land holding of five acre are going to be provided  with six thousand rupees per farmer as assistance. Provision for Pension to  Labourers from unorganised sector has been made. Army has been given a budget  of three lakh crore. Deen Dayal Upadhyay Jeevan Jyoti Yojana has been launched  to provide electricity to every household. Health Insurance cover of upto five lakhs  has been provided to every poor family under Ayushman Bharat Yojana. The Government formed in 2014  under the leadership of the hon. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is totally  corruption free.     The NDA Government has brought down inflation rate to 4.6, fiscal deficit  to 3.4 percent and made untiring efforts to encourage direct investment.    There was uneven distribution of land and property in the country and the  present Government has made efforts to do away with it.  Further, the Government  has brought rural poor and middle class under the Banking system.    The Government has focused on sanitation and allocated crores of rupees to  State Governments for construction of toilets in villages.  It has taken historical  decision to provide 10 percent reservation in Government jobs and educational  institutions for economically weaker sections in general category so that the people  may get justice.  Many measures have been taken to provide foodgrains at cheaper  rates to poor and middle class and huge gap between facilities of cities and villages  has been narrowed.      This Government is farmer friendly and working towards doubling of their  income and launching certain schemes for them.  It has taken care of health  facilities for the people of the country and done considerable work in the field of  animal husbandry, fisheries and dairy sector.  Also, it has taken care of farmers,  fishermen, labourers, businessmen, industrialists and people related to rural  business.  I support the interim budget of 2019-20. This is a budget for new India. For  one Rank One Pension Scheme Rupees 35 thousand crore have been allocated. A  new department for fisheries has been opened. Provision of providing Rupees three  thousand as pension labourer of unorganised sector after 60 years of age has been  made. 10 percent reservation to the poors from upper castes has been provided.  Budget allocation for defence has increased by three thousand crore. We have  become 6th major economy in the world. The Interim Budget 2019-20 has  adequately    focused on the progress and growth of the people. This budget will help in the  years to come to make a new India. In this budget measures have been initiated for  the balanced development of the Country. The Government has for the first time  constituted Navin Kalyan Vikas board for the welfare of nomadic tribes. Various  schemes like Ujjwala Yojana, Mudra Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Matri Vandana  Yojana etc. have been initiated for the Welfare of women in the country. Under  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana all margined farmers holding two  acres of land will be provided 6000/- rupees each year. The Government has  constituted Rashtriya Gokul Mission for the welfare of the Cow progeny  and also  initiated various measures for animal husbandry and fisheries. More than 600 Jan  Aushadi Kendras have been setup  to make available  medicines at affordable  prices to the poor people of the Country. On the occasion of 150th Birth  Anniversary of Mahatama Gandhi ji this Government has presented a budget for  benefit of  poor, farmers, labourers and youths. This Government has not only  achieved high growth rate but also controlled inflation and brought down fiscal  deficit from 6 percent to 3.4 percent. The Government has achieved 98 percent  target of rural sanitation and succeeded in declaring almost 5.45 lakh villages open  defecation free villages.

The  Government has provided 6 crore LPG connections free of cost under Ujjwala  Yojana and made a provision of maternity leave of 36 weeks to pregnant working  women. This Government has rationalised custom duty and procedures to  encourage Make in India initiative. The Government has prepared a vision for next  10 years and if this vision is implemented in coming 10 years the country will  certainly move forward on the path of progress. This Government has brought a new ray of  hope in the lives of poor people by providing 10% reservation in educational  institutions and jobs to economically weaker people.  About 12 crore small and  marginal farmers of our country used to face money crunch to purchase seeds and  fertilizers at the time of sowing.  Now with the launch of Pradhan Mantri Kisan  Samman Nidhi Yojna our farmers will no longer require to struggle for  procurement of seeds and fertilizers during three cycles of sowing seasons and they  will not get trapped into moneylenders' net.   The Government has taken a  historical decision in the budget to set up Rashtriya Kamdhenu Aayog for genetic  upgradation of bovine resources to enhance the milk productivity of cows. Besides,  a provision of Rs.750 crores has also been made for 'Rashtriya Gokul Mission'.  In  addition to it the sharecroppers should also be provided financial assistance from  the Calamity Relief Fund alongwith the farmers who get the benefit of crop  insurance in the event of natural calamity. I support this Budget  which ensures the development of the country for the next 10 years. This Interim  Budget is not the full Budget. The Budget which will be presented after the  Elections will be such which will usher in Acche Din and Sabka Saath Sabka  Vikas. With the announcement of providing more financial benefits to the soldiers,  the feeling of honour among soldiers has increased. Alongwith rebate in income  tax, the Budget has provided many things to the common man. About 60 crore  people are likely to be benefited by schemes like Kisan Samman Yojna, Ayushman  Yojna and pension for the workers of the unorganised sector. With the decision to  set up Rashtriya Kamdhenu Ayog and a separate department for fisheries, there  sectors will become stronger economically. This budget is the foundation of  development journey of new India. The common man will benefit a lot from new  provisions of income tax.

The Ten Points explained in the budget will  prove helpful in the building of an empowered India. For the first time, the  Government has allocated defence budget of more than 3 lakh crore rupees. This  budget is a reflection of a new India by the year 2022 which will include clean and  healthy citizen and environment, toilet in every house, electricity and water to  everyone, doubling of farmer's income and the building of an India free from  terrorism, casteism, communalism, corruption and nepotism. This budget has shown the glimpse of a strong  economy.

Target of setting up of more than 3  lakh service centre has been fixed to provide service facility to the people.  India is  considered to be the first front runners with regard to the use of mobile data. I hope that the objectives of  social inclusion, growth in jobs and most importantly farmer welfare are ultimately  achieved.  I would like to thank the Government for the Pradhan Mantri Kisan  Samman Nidhi Scheme wherein a sum of Rs. 6000 would be deposited directly in  the farmers\\u2019 bank account every year.  More than 12.5 crores farmers will benefit  from this.  Similarly, the Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maandhan assures a monthly  pension of Rs. 3000 for workers in the unorganized sector.  Special trust should be  paid for rural road development under Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana.  The  Hon. Finance Minister has offered a full tax rebate for individuals whose total  income is below Rs. 5,00,000.  It is estimated that 3 crore middle class tax payers  would benefit from this proposal.  To boost affordable housing, tax exemptions for  development of housing projects are extended by a year which are further likely to  accelerate construction and provide a boost to the real estate sector.  In this Budget  an emphasis has been given to technological development, creation of digital  infrastructure and digitalization of governance.  A healthy allocation of Rs. 3 L  crore towards Defence can transform India\\u2019s defence preparedness and secure our  long term strategic interests.  Overall, this has been an expansionary Budget with  an equal emphasis on all strata\\u2019s of the society. Our Prime Minister has given a  stable and transparent Government to the country through his farsightedness and  able leadership.  This Government has started working towards making \\u201cNew  India\\u201d by 2022 which is free from terrorism, communalism, castism, corruption  and discrimination.  Today we have become a sixth largest economy of the world.   The Government has reduced the rate of inflation to 4.6 per cent and brought down  the fiscal deficit in 2018-19 RE to 3.4 per cent which was almost at its highest  level of 6 per cent earlier. While taking steps against corruption and black money  our Government has cracked down on economic offenders through The Fugitive  Economic Offenders Act 2018 and The Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act,  1988.  The Government has now ensured 10% reservation in educational institutes  and jobs for poor while maintaining the existing reservation provided to SCs/ STs/  OBCs.

The Government  has, for the first time in the history, fixed Minimum Support Price of all 22 crops at  minimum 50% more than the cost.

In the year  2019-20, for the first time our Defence Budget has crossed 3,00,000 crore rupees.   The Government has embarked upon a programme to deliver work of 8 crore free  LPG connection under Ujjwala Yojana.  Many effective steps have been taken to  strengthen the small and medium enterprise sector.  Recently, a scheme of  sanctioning loan upto Rs. 1 crore in 59 minutes has been launched.  In this way, the  Government has made efforts to provide relief and justice to all sections of the  society.    Several necessary steps have been taken by  the Government to double the income of farmers. Large number of power  connection have been provided under Saubhagya Yojana in my Parliamentary  Constituency Sidhi. I distribute gas under Ujjwala in almost my every programme.  Our Government has shown commitment of providing Pucca houses to all poor  families by 2022 who have kachcha houses. My Parliamentary Constituency Sidhi  has largely been benefited from Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. Our Government  has given a new lease of life to Lalitpur-Singrauli rail project which had been  pending since long and a gift of rupees 325 crore has been received for the purpose  and a allocation of rupees 300 crore has been made for doubling of Katni-Singrauli  route. This is priceless gift for me and people of my Constituency. In this Budget there is provision for  increased allocation for Rastriya Gokul Mission to 750 crore in current year. Two  per cent interest subvention to farmers pursuing animal husbandry and fisheries.  \\\"Urgent action needed to increase hydrocarbon production to decrease imports;  Committee under NITI Aayog to be set up to identify and denotify nomadic and  semi-nomadic communities; Welfare Development Board to be set up; Pradhan  Mantri Shram Yogi Mandhan, to provide assured monthly pension. (This) will  benefit 10 crore workers in unorganized sector. Under Pradhan Mantri Kisan  Samman Nidhi, 6000 rupees per year for each farmer in three installments, this  initiative is likely to benefit 12 crore small and marginal farmers. Hon. Finance Minister has  presented a historic budget which is welfare and development oriented facilitating  India to emerge as a superpower at the global stage.  The world bank has said that  India will be one of the fastest growing economy of the world with the growth rate  of 7.5 per cent.  The report of the Development Centre of Harvard University has  also revealed that Indian Economy will be at the pinnacle of fastest growing  economy of the world in the coming decade.  I would like to congratulate the hon.  Prime Minister that we have become number one country of the world leaving the  USA behind in respect of FDI.  Today, India has emerged as the largest hub of  investment in the entire world.  Besides, we have jumped from 142nd to 77th  position in the Ease of Doing Business Index.  The number of tax payers has gone  up from 1.3 crore to 7.6 crore after the implementation of the GST.  The efforts are  being made to double the income of farmers by the year 2022.  For the first time,  11 crore farmers and vendors will avail of the facilities of online marketing  platform in the year 2018-19 and 1.27 crore farmers are likely to be benefitted  directly from this move. It is a matter of pride that our country is on the  path of development. Pending projects have been completed by the government.  There has been decline in the rate of inflation. Huge investments have been made  by foreign institutions. The government has worked for all the sections of the  society. Monthly GST collection has reached the level of approximately one lakh  crore rupees, which is one of the major achievements of this government.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana has created sense of security and confidence in crores of  families. Farmers have been benefitted greatly by measures like raising MSP one  and a half times, increasing the coverage of crop insurance to every household,  Neem coating of urea and making provision of assured annual financial assistance  to 12 crore farmer families. Every citizen of this country has been benefitted from  the development schemes in this interim Budget. The newly invention PM- Kisan Yojana is direct cash transfer to the farmer.  So the income support scheme  to farmers is good and no one will oppose it. We are all proud about Chandrayaan  and the hundred satellites launched with just one rocket. But madam how it is  helping the farmers in India? But none of the fisherman I able to use this data for  fishing. The single biggest worry is the jobless youth. Unemployment has actually  increased. On solar energy things went horrible wrong our policies were not right.  Many power producers as well as solar PV panel manufactures became bankrupt.  However, I am very glad about the recent plan of the government to put a mega  solar PV plant in Ladakh. We are happy at last the tribal university is allocated. It is indeed a wholesome budget taking care of  each and every section of society. Be it a major relief for taxpayers of nation or  income support to farmers through PM-KISAN, development of women,  empowering of youth, enhancement in Asha Yojana and Aanganwadi honorarium  by 50% or strengthening of defence and National Security, the budget took into  account all aspects for nation's development. Jandhan Yojana, inflation control and  UDAN are the success stories of the government. The government has announced  a scheme to provide Rs. 6000 annually to each and every small and marginal  farmer. Modiji himself belongs to a poor family, so he knows how poverty can be  alleviated. Modiji initiated many economic reforms to bail out fragile Indian  economy and a number of steps have been taken to improve the condition of the  poor. This government provided 8 crore free LPG connections to poor households  during the last 4 years. Ayushman Bharat is another example. Poor persons can  avail insurance cover by paying premium of only Rs. 12 annually. Inflation rate  was as low as 4% in 2018 during the NDA regime. The government has not only  controlled the price, but also has increased MSP by 150%. Shri Swaminathan has  also appreciated this scheme. This Prime Minister's attitude is nation should be first  in priority and not his family members. I am grateful to the Finance Minister for his  visionary ideas. The Union Budget has also reflected the Government's objectives  of comprehensive development of each and every section of the society. The  Government has been able to infuse new hope and confidence among the people of  the Country. Shri Narendra Modiji has been made all out effort to improve the life  of every Indian. Schemes like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Ujjawala Yojana,  Ayushman Bharat Yojana for free treatment, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana,  Pradhan Mantri Soubhagya Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana will definitely  transform the destiny of the poor and the needy. The Social Security Schemes  announced in the Budget by the Government for uplifting the poor is a  commendable step. Shri Piyush Goyalji has presented a very pragmatic and people  friendly Budget that will benefit every section of the Society. The first and foremost important  individual is the farmer.  It is only when we can empower the farmer and the  agriculture sector, India will emerge stronger.  The Government has been  relentlessly working towards strengthening farmers and one such initiative through  this Budget is Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi.  Under this scheme farmers  holding up to 2 hectare of land will be given Rs.6000 per annum.  The number of  farmers who will get this benefit is huge.  This is the first time ever that any  Government has brought in the ambit of the budget the concerns of the  unorganised sector.   Budget 2019 has announced a mega pension scheme for  unorganised sector worker to provide assured pension of Rs.3000 rupees per month  to nearly 10 core people.  Those earning upto Rs.5 lakh a year will get full tax  rebate.  The Government has undertaken many effective steps to strengthen MSME  sector, which provides employment to crores of people.    'Housing for all' is a  priority for the Government.  And as per Budget 2019, as many as 1.53 crore  houses have been constructed under the flagship housing scheme Pradhan Mantri  Awas Yojana both in urban and rural segments.    A total of 28531 km national  highways were constructed since FY 2014-15, contrasting with 16505 km by the  UPA government up to FY 2013-14.  This is the commitment of our Government  towards infrastructure. Availing treatment free of cost under the Ayushman Bharat  has helped around 10 lakh people since its launch in September this year.  I would  like to congratulate our Hon'ble Finance Minister for presenting such a reformist  budget which addresses the concerns of almost all sections of the society. I rise to support the Hon. President\\u201fs  Address.  India in 2087 will be the world\\u201fs biggest democracy.  It will also  overtake China to be the world\\u201fs most populous country.

The present Government has made an effort to make Gandhiji's idea turn into  reality through its programmes and works. When the Government started thinking  in terms of well-being of poor middle class, it carried out cleanliness campaign  followed by providing toilets in each house and bringing it forward, it made an  effort to provide better and cheaper health facility by reducing the costs on  medicines through Jan Aushadi Kendras. When the Government started \\\"Ujjwala  Yojana\\\" our poor sister living in village got rid of the problems being faced while  cooking for the family. All these works are on the verge of completion within  scheduled time. Today, the whole opposition is misleading by showing the unity.  In such a situation, I believe that the people of the country will appreciate the  works done by the present Government. I support this motion in the House.  Our Government has performed on the ground. More than 4900 Jan Aushadhi  Kendras have been opened in more than 600 districts across the country.

NDA Government led by our dynamic leader Shri  Narendra Modi ji has kept the promise of increasing MSP for farmers. Special  emphasis has been given to the alternate dispute resolution mechanisms. I would like to congratulate the  Government on its commendable economy success.  We are now one of the fastest  growing economies in the world.  In the Ease of Doing Business Ranking, we are  now at 77th rank from a rank of 142 in 2014.  The Goods and Services Tax,  demonetisation and other legislations that have been brought into place has  formalized the economy.  This has benefitted all sections of society, especially the  poorest sections of society.  Indeed, the Government has worked hard towards  realization of aspirations of all the sections. Nation building is no longer controlled  by an elite few.  By reducing the cost of farming, providing the farmers with fair  price for their crops, providing access to new markets, our Government has  restored the farmer\\u201fs confidence.  Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana has ensured  crop insurance to farmers at low premiums to safeguard them from potential crisis  due to crop damage.  Providing rural santiation has been an important goal of our  Government and we have delivered.  Almost 5.45 lakh villages have been covered  in last four years.  Infrastructure creation and timely completion of projects has  been delivered by our Government.  In just 4 years, we now are at the 3rd position  in terms of number of start-ups in the world.  Our Government has created a  domino effect of prosperity.  Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas is now a reality. Our government not only took up the  challenges of 2014 and continued working on its plans but also delivered the  results. The Government has enhanced the dignity of the country in the world by  taking steps such as welfare of the poor, building infrastructure, women  empowerment, raising income of the farmers and securing the borders of the  country, containing inflation, corruption and terrorism at the same time.Today,  there is a conducive atmosphere for progress in the country and the country is  marching ahead.

Under my parliamentary constituency Jammu, renovation work of Jammu railway  station should be undertaken and new airport, passport office, medical college,  AIIMS, IIT should be built there.  Construction of Jammu Poonch railway line  should be started at the earliest. I am extremely grateful to the Hon'ble  President of India for his visionary ideas. Moreover, the President's Address has  also reflected the government's objectives of comprehensive development of each  and every section of society living in every nook and corner of the country. The  Social Security Scheme launched by the Government for uplifting the poor is a  commendable step. I whole heartedly thank the Hon'ble President of India for his  concern for the people of North-East India. These two bridges over the river  Brahmaputra will benefit lakhs of people of the region. The passing of the 103th  Amendment to the Constitution to extend the benefit of reservation of the poor  belonging to the general category is historic step towards eradication social  disparity.   Our country can progress only when  our farmers will become self sufficient and empowered.  As a result of Jan Dhan  Yojana, 34 crore people have bank accounts in the country today.

The Government is constantly making efforts to  get the legislation relating to Triple Talaq passed for the Muslim daughters.  Our  country is marching ahead with the ideals of social and economic justice as given  by Baba Saheb Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar in the Constitution.  This way, the dream  of creation of a new India will be realized. This Government is committed  towards the welfare of the downtrodden people.  Hon'ble President has also  appreciated the Government for implementing demonetisation and GST, providing  reservation to economically backward section and conducting surgical strike.   Providing 10 per cent reservation to the economically backward section is a  historical step.  Government has also taken various steps to provide basic  necessities to people and to curb the menace of black money and corruption.  Apart  from that, it has also taken many initiatives for the empowerment of poor people,  women, youth and middle class.  Today, India's voice is being heard with great  admiration on various global platforms.  Our country has demonstrated a new state  policy and convention by conducting surgical strike on terrorists hideouts across  the border.

Moreover, constitutional status has been accorded to National  Commission for Backward Classes. Our country has made appreciable  progress in every field during the last four and a half years.  With the construction  of 9 crore toilets, the percentage of sanitation has risen to 98 per cent which was  only 40 per cent in the year 2014.  More than six crore gas connections have been  provided under the Ujjwala Yojana.  Under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, a  provision of medical expenses upto Rs.

Maximum benefit of the Pradhan Mantri  Mudra Yojana has accrued to the women.  The Government has given the  minimum support price for 22 crops one and a half times more than their cost  price.  Bank accounts of 34 crore people have been opened in the country till date.   This has linked every family of the country with the banking system.  Our  Government started a campaign against corruption and black money right from the  first day and this has yielded good results.  The concept of One Nation-One Tax -  One Market has fructified as a result of comprehensive tax reforms such as the  GST.  The ranking of India in Ease of Doing Business was 142nd, which has now  risen to 77th.  India has become the sixth biggest economy of the world as of now.   Due to the tireless efforts of the hon. Prime Minister, effective results have come  up in respect of the Make in India initiative.  Our country has been progressing in  every field today.  With these words I strongly support the Motion of Thanks. The focus of the present Government  policies has been the welfare of the poor, middle class, the exploited and the  deprived sections, farmers, labourers and the youth of the country.  The Union  Government has taken significant steps in vital areas such as financial inclusion,  encouragement to small businesses, empowerment to the deprived communities,  housing construction, clean energy, sanitary campaign, rural electrification,  affordable and easily accessible health services, farmer welfare, women  empowerment, skill development, incentive to the entrepreneurship of Scheduled  Castes/Scheduled Tribes, welfare of the differently abled and their empowerment  and rural employment.  I thank the hon. President for this address dedicated to the  vision of all inclusiveness. The President's Address clearly manifests that  the incumbent government has put back the country on the path of faster growth  and development.  After 2014, the Government has rooted out the corruption and  has also brought an end to the uncertainties  owing to which people are reposing  their faith in the Government.  The Government has taken a big initiative in  providing training and skill development to the youths.  As many as 10000 skill  development centres and more than 600 Prime Minister Skill Centres have  augmented the skills of youth.  A loan of 7 lakh crore has been disbursed to about  15 crore people under the Mudra Scheme to start their industries and businesses.   The Government has also scrapped more than 3 lakh fake companies causing huge  loss to the revenues of the country.  The number of educational institutes has been  increased to provide higher education and professional courses to the sons and  daughters of the country.  The programmes and schemes launched by hon. Prime  Minister have strengthened the women empowerment in the country.  The  Minimum Support Price of 22 crops has been increased one and half times so as to  double the income of farmers.  Several welfare schemes have been launched in the  country so as to benefit the people at large. On 31st January, H.E. the President,  gave an historic and unprecedented address in which he mentioned demonetisation,  Rafale, GST, Surgical strike, One Rank One Pension, National Police Memorial,  Ujjawala Yojana, Ayushman Yojana, Mudra Yojana.  After the hard work by the  hon. Prime Minister, the Indian economy is the most promising economy in the  world today.  About Aadhaar card, the World Bank has said that the countries of  the world should follow the Indian system of Aadhaar card.  The way the  Government has taken steps for bringing together the benefits being provided to all  the beneficiaries through Aadhaar, even the World Bank has followed the IMF in  contending that poverty is being eradicated in India.  Direct benefit of more than  Rs.7 lakh crore has been provided to the poor through these schemes.  During the  UPA-I and UPA-II regime, 1 lakh 17 thousand crore rupees used to be pocketed by  the power brokers through corruption. The hon. Prime Minister has saved this  money of the people of this country.  'Work is Worship', H.E. President has  mentioned it.  Following this, an environment of development is being created in  the country today by establishing more than 3 lakh common service centres, by  seizing benami properties worth 50,000 crore rupees and by increasing the Income  Tax base from 3.5 crore to 7 crore.  Keeping in view, the picture of India presented  by H.E. the President  in his Address and the growing confidence of the people in  this Government, I support this motion of thanks. This Government has taken a  pledge for a 'New India', an India where nobody remains hungry, where everyone  gets basic healthcare and education.   This Government has tried to complete all  the suspended good initiatives of previous Governments.  Today, the railway lines  are expanding at a rapid rate, the port development is under focus, gas pipelines are  being laid, the fertiliser plants that were shut down are again being started, toilets  are being built in crores of households and new opportunities of employment are  coming up.  Be it a city or a village, the Government is trying to strengthen the  health related infrastructure.  The Government has launched the Saubhagya  Scheme to connect the households with electricity.   The benefits of Government  schemes are reaching the masses.  The poorest of poor are getting basic needs of  life fulfilled, from healthcare to sanitation, education to cooking gas, and much  more.  This Government has launched 'Ayushaman India Scheme' last year.   Medicines are being provided at more than 700 of such centres at very low cost.   The direct benefit transfers are also reaching the poor without any pilferage.    The  Government is trying to double the income of the country's farmers a first of its  kind initiative taken by any Government.  Goods and Services Tax (GST) has  made business easy in every part of the country.  More than 31 crore bank accounts  have been opened under Jan Dhan Yojana.  We have transferred the 27 crore  rupees of unclaimed money to their bank accounts with the help of Universal  Account Number.  Under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana loans of more than 10  lakh crore rupees have been approved.  Under UDAN scheme, 12 lakh seats have  been made available to the people at a reduced price.  We are also monitoring the  work of roads and railways with the help of drones.  Today more than 115 crore  people have Aadhaar cards.  Funds are being deposited by Direct Benefit Transfer  in the accounts of the poor for about 450 schemes of the Central Government.   Women have been the greatest beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.   Six crore women have also joined self-help groups under the Deendayal Antodaya  Yojana.  Maternity leaves have been extended from 12 weeks to 26 weeks.  The  Government is trying to bring about an end to the practice of triple talaq.  More  than 6 crore gas connections in houses under the Ujjwala scheme.  In the last four  and a half years, our Government has worked towards social and economic  development of the society.   No one can deny the truth that the India is emerging  stronger under the leadership of our Hon'ble PM. Against this backdrop and track  record of the Government, I can confidently say that very soon India will emerge  as an economic and social super-power under the leadership of our Hon'ble Prime  Minister. The Government has made a  historical move by determining 2022 the target year for providing houses to all.   The works done by the Government under the Swachha Bharat Mission is being  appreciated by the whole world.  The poor women are being provided gas  connections free of cost under the Ujjwala Scheme and as a result of which the  quality of their lives is improving.  About 2.47 crore households got electric  connections in the country under the Pradhan Mantri Saubhagya Yojana of the  Government.  Our Government has launched the Aayushman Bharat Yojana but  the Congress ruled States have not so far implemented this scheme. First of all I would like to express my gratitude  to the hon. Prime Minister for conferring the award of Bharat Ratna on Nanaji  Deshmukh who chose Chitrakoot of my Parliamentary Constituency, Satna as his  place of work.  I would like to submit that the economy of the country has acquired  the growth rate of 7.3 per cent during the last four and a half years.  India's  contribution to the world GDP was 2.6 per cent in 2014 and the same has gone up  to 3.3 per cent.  The Government has formulated schemes keeping the basic  requirements of every individual in view.  In my Parliamentary Constituency of  Satna, 1,70,000 beneficiaries have been provided gas connections under the  Ujjwala scheme.  44,475 houses have been approved for construction under  Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and out of them the construction of 37,117 houses  has been completed.  2,05,800 Golden Cards have been issued to the people in my  district under the Ayushmaan Bharat Yojana.  44,826 connections have already  been provided in the Satna district under the Saubhagya Yojana.  The Modi  Government has done justice to the poor of the upper castes by providing them 10  per cent reservation.  I would like to thank the Government once again by saying  this much that the scenario of the rural and urban areas is changing and the poor  people have started believing that they might be free from problems.  The hon.  Prime Minister has provided an honest Government during the last five years.  The  way the charges of corruption are being levelled against our Government is not  conducive to the fabric of democracy. The country is celebrating 150th birth  anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation with gusto.  Hon.  President in his speech has highlighted all the aspects.  The country was passing  through a phase of uncertainty before the General Election of the year 2014.  After  formation of this Government, a resolution has been taken to make a new India.   The objective of this transparent Government was \\u2018Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas\\u2019.   Nine crore toilets have been constructed under Swach Bharat Mission.  More than  six crore gas connections have been provided under Ujjawala Yojana till date.  Gas  connections have been provided to 1,15,000 women in my Parliamentary  Constituency.  A provision has been made to provide cash incentives upto Rs.5  lakh each family each year in case of serious illness under Ayushman Bharat  Yojana.   The Government is also providing 6.5 per cent interest to the people of  low income group under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.  Two crore 47 lakh homes  have already been connected with electricity till date.  In my Parliamentary  Constituency 1042 villages, mohallas have been electrified. Out of 15 crore, 73 per  cent women entrepreneurs have received MUDRA loan in all over the country.   National Sports University has been set up.  The Government is making efforts day  and night to double the farmers\\u2019 income.  Soil Health Cards have been distributed,  availability of fertilizers has been ensured and 100 % neem coating of urea has also  been ensured.  In my Parliamentary Constituency 446 village Panchayats have  been connected through internet broadband.  The contribution of India in the world  GDP was 2.6 per cent in the year 2014 which has been increased upto 3.3 per cent.   A network of highways connectivity is being developed throughout the country.   Thus, our villages, labourers, women, doctors, teachers, scientists, farmers and  youth are getting benefit through all these developmental works. In the Union Budget,  extending relief to the middle class income tax limit has been doubly enhanced to  Rs.5 lakh.  This will benefit three crore taxpayers.  This Budget comprises small  rebates in various forms and structures with a view to giving a fillip to the housing  sector.  The interests accrued on bank deposits and the one received as rent has  also been increased from the existing ceiling of Rs.10 thousand to Rs.40 thousand  in terms of TDS.  This step will enhance disposable income.  Marginal farmers  having landholding upto 2 hectare would be given Rs.6 thousand per annum under  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi.  This will benefit 12 crore farmers.  This is  in honour of marginal farmers.  Defence allocation has been enhanced by 6.87 per  cent and has been increased to Rs.3.18 lakh crore.  This apart, the veterans\\u2019 morale  has also been strengthened with the implementation of one rank one pension  scheme.  Matri Vandana scheme has been launched for the pregnant women which  will go a long way in nurturing the infant as well as edifying their health profile.   With these words, I support this Budget and earnestly hope that the people would  not leave us in bad humour. This Government has created credibility  in the political arena.  People have greatly benefitted from Ayushman Bharat  Scheme.  We have made arrangement for transferring an amount of 75000 crore  rupees annually directly to the bank accounts of farmers without involving any  intermediary.  The second thing is 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'.  There is no  discrimination on the basis of religion, class or caste.  Another aspect of 'Sabka  Saath, Sabka Vikas' is development of all the regions.  We have identified 115  backward districts and have taken care of development of these districts.  We have  ensured all round development in the North East Region.  Our Government has  provided corruption free governance.  The hon'ble Prime Minister took a bold  decision and implemented GST.  This has resulted in the expansion of our  economy.  This Government is undertaking public welfare works with the resolve  to uplift the weakest sections of the society.  I certainly believe that this  Government would get mandate of the people again.  I support the Motion of  Thanks on the President's Address. The Government under the leadership of our hon.  Prime Minister has worked to make India a strong nation.  The work done by the  Prime Minister is unmatched and no one has been able to do that in the past 70  years.  This Government has completed the schemes started by it.  In the past five  years nobody levelled charges of corruption against any Minister of the  Government.   Special relief has been provided to middle class tax payers by  raising the tax limit to five lakh rupees.  It is the first time ever that Rs. 6000 per  year would be provided to those farmers having less than 2 hectares of land.  The  Central Government has launched the  'Pradhan Mantri Bima Yojana, under which  the farmers will have to deposit 1.5 per cent premium for Rabi crop and 2 per cent  premium for kharif crop and rest of the premium would be provided by the Central  Government.  When we were in the power in Rajasthan  at the time we waived the  loans of farmers  upto Rs. 50,000.  In case of any natural calamity the farmer  would be provided rebate on loan amount upto 2 per cent and if he repays his loan  on time a rebate of  3 per cent would be given provided.  This Government has  provided free gas connections to eight crore poor families the Government has  launched the MUDRA Yojana under which 15 crore people have been granted  loans including 73 per cent women.  I come from western Rajasthan.  My  Parliamentary Constituency is Sri Ganganagar.  For the first time it has been  decided by the Government to make road along the 1060 kilometers of long border  under the Bharat Mala and the Government is spending 25,000 crore rupees on it.   The Government will construct a green corridor from Amritsar to Bhavnagar and a  sum of Rs. 25,000 crore has been allocated for it.  13 new trains have started  running under my Parliamentary Constituency.  And each and every railway  station is being renovated.  First time, the funds allocated by the 14th Finance  Commission as well as funds allocated by State Finance Commission has reached  Gram Panchayats.  Hon. Prime Minister has run a corruption free Government for  five years.  The Government has taken a pledge to build a new India by 2022.  I  would like to make a mention of the Rajasthan Canal which was constructed in  1970 and was not renovated till date and for the first time a proposal to this effect  was forwarded by the then hon. Chief Minister of Rajasthan and a sum of Rs. 3400  crore has been allocated by the Government for the purpose. I am particularly grateful to the Hon. Prime  Minister who has taken pains to release Rs.57 crore for developing the \\u2018Nirvan  Sthali\\u2019 of Kabir Saheb into a tourist destination.  Sanction has been accorded for  laying new railway lines in a small district- Sant Kabir Nagar.  With this  development, the new railway shall connect seven Parliamentary Constituencies.  The date for laying the foundation stone of this project which is likely to involve  an expenditure of Rs.5 thousand crore, is going to be fixed in the near future.   Under the campaign launched against black-money, certain strict steps such as  demonetization, Fugitive  Economic Offenders Act and laws enacted for bringing  in black-money have led to the seizure and attachment of the assets amounting to  Rs.50 thousand crore.  During this period benami properties bearing worth Rs.6900  crore and foreign assets worth Rs.1600 crore have been attached.  North Eastern  region has also been extended a host of schemes involving more than Rs.21  thousand crore.  Be it through revolution in the railways or in the field of education  or that of Ujjawala revolution, the Government has been able to translate the  dreams of those mothers and sisters who had suffered deprivation for years  together.  In the previous regime, four kilometers road used to be constructed a day  whereas 28 kilometers of road are being constructed now on daily basis.  The  railways have given a gift to the women by advertising recruitment for the 600  women. The President's Address, in fact,  reflects more of true image of Bharat than India.   I convey my sincere thanks to  H.E. President of India for honouring the farmers of the country by calling them  Anna Data.  Our Government took the historic decision to give one and half times  more price than the input cost for as many as 22 crops.  Weaker sections of the  upper caste people also got 10% reservation.  According constitutional status to the  Backward Classes Commission symbolizes this Government's commitment to the  cause of social justice.  The recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission have  also been implemented.  One Rank One Pension was also granted to all the  personnel of the Armed Forces and the largest health care scheme of the world has  also been implemented in the country.  Implementation of the GST was the biggest  economic reform undertaken after the independence.  Under the Mudra Scheme,  about 15 lakh people have been given loans and out of those given loans,  75% are  women.  Providing gas connection under the Ujjawala Scheme is also a welcome  step. I think, this Bill should have been brought  long back. But, there is no doubt that it is very good for the criminal justice system,  the civil system and more so for the people of this country.  I have one question.   Your object under Section 21 is that no DNA should be taken up without consent.   If some investigating agency or any other agency abuses that power, what steps  would be taken against that person under this law?  In a criminal case, unless  consent in writing is given, nothing can be taken and if the investigating agency  wants to take it, they have to make an application.  But how a civil dispute would  be covered?  Therefore, immigration authority will be having the excessive power  to collect the DNA which is not your object.  Then come many other cases.  In a  case of medical negligence, how will DNA come into that?  There is an issue  relating to abandoned children and disputed children.  Until a child attains 18 years  of age, can his DNA be collected?  Does it not violate. The Child Protection Rights  Act?  This Act has many laudable objectives.  So many preventive steps have been  taken.  People will be secure and things will be done properly. I would like to congratulate the  Minister for bringing this long pending Bill.  This Bill is very important.  Recently,  there was a famous case of a senior politician over the fixation of parentage.  As  you  know, the parentage was finally decided with the help of the DNA  technology. I would like to raise certain issues.  There are two clauses-clauses 21  and 23 in civil matters-which state that no consent is required.  There is no clarity  in this matter.  A civil matter comes when there is a dispute about the parentage  and a child is claimed by different people.  I think, there must be clarity with  regard to the consent in civil matters, whether consent of accused or victim is  required, what the procedure is and whether it would require a Magistrate's order.   These things need to be clarified.  In medical cases also, DNA technology is  absolutely necessary to ascertain whether negligence was there.  Now, I come to  storage of data. There is no clarity on storage of these profiles in the DNA  laboratories.    With regard to databank, we have clarity on regulatory board, but  there is no clarity on clause 31(4) with regard to data storage in a DNA lab.  I  would request the Minister to clarify this point. The common man of the country  has had been demanding for decades that if SC, ST categories have got reservation  then there should also be reservation in Government jobs for the economically  backward people of the general category.  Now this reservation will be provided  through amendment in the Article 15 and Article 16 of the Constitution. Our leader  and hon. Chief Minister of Bihar, Nitish Kumar ji has already been an advocate of  this reservation.  Economically backward people of general category of all  religions shall be given 10 per cent reservation in the jobs and educational  institutions.  This is an example of implementation of Modiji\\u2019s philosophy of  \\u2018Sab  Ka Sath, Sab Ka Vikas\\u2019.  This proposal of giving reservation to economically  backward people of general category was also brought during the time of Narsimha  Rao ji but then it was declared unconstitutional.  Today, I am hopeful that our  colleagues from Congress will also welcome this Bill.  I support this Bill. A Constitution (Amendment) Bill  has been moved as a special agenda. Attempts have been made to identify the  economically weaker section of the society, and provide them and support them  with affirmative action. Not only the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes are poor,  backward classes are poor, but people who are from general category are also poor  who are in need of education, in need of services, in need of employment. The  economically weaker section of society needs to be identified and they should be  provided affirmative support. For the first time in the history of our democratic  republic, economically weaker sections of citizens are being provided the benefit  through affirmative action. Clauses 4 and 5 of Article 15, and clause 4 of Article  16 provide reservation for people as per caste.  But here, as per their economic  status, reservation is going to be provided both in services as well as in  employment. The economic criterion needs adequate reformation every ten years.  A poor is a poor and he needs all sorts of support from the Government and also  from society. The poor have to be identified and the poor have to be provided with  all sorts of affirmative support from the Government and that is what is required.  The identification of the beneficiary would be on economic criteria and that needs  to be upgraded invariably in a time period. The State Government will determine  about the economically weaker category.  I support this Bill. Our Party will support  this Bill. I rise to speak in support of 124th  Amendment Bill of the Constitution. We will provide opportunity to the weaker  section of society i.e. the poor to move forward under Article 46 of the Directive  Principles of State Policy.  It is a historical step after the journey of 72 years of  independence.  Hon. Modiji is worthy of congratulation for this.  He should also be  congratulated for executing the work of providing this reservation without  tampering the reservation given to other Backward Castes, Scheduled Castes and  Scheduled Tribes.  When the Government of Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee came to  power, the place of development in the country increased rapidly during those six  years.  When the Government of Modiji came to power, the pace of development  increased four fold on all fronts and a lot of avenues for jobs are being made  available.  There is a large section in general category also which needs some  support.  The welfare of the poor from general category should also be taken into  concern.  The Government has given the benefit of reservation to the poor general  category without reducing anyone's reservation even by one per cent.  Such poor  can be from any castes of general category.  Only the coalition Government of  NDA can take big steps here. Today, the Government which is committed towards  the poor in the country has once again proved that it is committed for the welfare  of Dalit, backward and poor of upper castes with full dedication. Today is a big historic day.  Today Modi ji  has taken a historic step to provide reservation to those castes among SC, ST, OBC  and forward classes who were not covered earlier for this purpose.  No  Government provided legitimate power to OBC's but Modi Government.  After 70  years of independence there was grudge among forward classes against SC, ST and  OBC reservation and protests were being organized against reservation.  Now this  step has put a complete check on said protests.  It is indeed 'Sabka Saath Sabka  Vikas'.  All citizens of the country who are facing injustice would be very happy  with this decision.  Our civilization and culture is above caste system but due to  wrong policies castes have been divided.  Hon'ble Modi ji and the Government has  brought this Bill to end the bane of poverty.  I support this Bill and urge upon all  the parties to do so. History is being created today in this  august House.  The Constitution (124th Amendment) Bill providing 10 per cent  reservation is going to pave the way for the prosperity of the children of the poor  from general category.  The poor people of the general category were deprived of  Government jobs for want of  reservation for them.  Moreover, they were deprived  of getting admission to the higher institutions of education.  But such a significant  decision taken by the Government has sent a message among the people of general  category that this Government takes care of everybody.  At the same time, the  existing system of reservation has not been tinkered with.  People from all the  religions have been covered under the ambit of this 10 per cent reservation. This is a good decision to provide 10%  reservation to the economically weaker sections of general category.  I used to  demand time and again that economically weaker sections of general category  should also get reservation.  Members from the opposition are saying that today is  the last day.  What difference does it make?  After all the Bill has been introduced.   They used to interrupt the proceedings of the House due to which this delay  happened.  Baba Saheb Ambedkar wanted to have equality in the society.  That is  why hon. Prime Minister has given the slogan, 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'.  My  party, the Republican Party supports this Bill. The dream as well as the cause I  have been cherishing and fighting for all through my life has been translated into  reality today.   'Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas' has been the primordial plank and the  basic guiding principle of this Government.  All the schemes piloted by this  Government are aimed at ameliorating the status of the poor, those living in  cottages and the destitute.  Today a Bill for the reservation of the poor and the  helpless belonging to upper castes has come up and I support the Bill.  Alongside, I  would urge upon crores of youth of the country to wake up and  welcome the new  sun of development that has appeared on the horizon and of course I would take  this opportunity to egg on them to take the society forward driven by inclusive  spirit. As per the prevalent situation today,  it is an outdated impression that leprosy cannot be cured and therefore, it will be a   cause for divorce.  So, this Bill seeks to amend various Acts.  But nowadays, with  modern medicines, leprosy is curable.  I fully support the amendments that have  been moved in this Bill. The opposition sought a discussion  on an important issue and we expressed our willingness to hold a discussion.  But  the Congress Party took more than 20 days to prepare itself for this discussion.   The national security is not paramount for them.  This Government enters into   defence agreements keeping national interest in mind.  In fact, in their regime no  defence deal would be completed without a \\u2018deal\\u2019 involved in it.  There is a long  list of scams perpetrated by them, be it Bofors,  Submarine, Augusta Westland,  National Herald case.  All these scams took place to arrange political funding for  the Congress Party.  Now the Supreme Court\\u2019s decision has come and it is a  victory for our Armed Forces, of truth and that of the Government and at the same  time this is a serious setback to the Congress Party.  The Supreme Court has stated  in detail that they looked into the pricing, procedure and the offset clause and  found that there was no commercial favouratism.  This also proves that this  Government has strengthened the Armed Forces, and took this decision in the  larger national interest.  The Congress Party must know that they could not take a  decision in this regard for ten long years and now they raise the issue relating to  the Rafale.  Finally, this deal has been completed by our Government.  Had your  Government clinched this deal, then our Government would not have at all  required to procure these aircraft.  I would like to ask as to why the name of one  family crops up repeatedly in defence deals.  Today, our Armed Forces are happy,  the Government is happy and the people of the country are also happy.  The  decision of the Hon. Supreme Court has established the truth in clear terms. The Government has completed the  deal for procurement of 36 Rafale aircraft with the Dassault Aviation in a  transparent manner.   Our Government has completed this deal in a minimum  possible time, though this deal was pending for ten long years. The opposition is  constantly raising the issue of corruption in this deal.  The Congress party has lost  its faith in Hon. Supreme Court.  When the Supreme Court stated that there was no  violation of rules in this deal, still this Government is being targeted for gaining  some political mileage only.  The Air Force of the country has also stated that this  fighter aircraft is good for the defence of the country.  Only issue is that of offset  contract.  The French Government and the Dassault Aviation have categorically  stated that there was no pressure from the Government of India in this regard.  The  HAL has also stated that they were not in a position to manufacture Rafale.  Our  Air Force is going to receive 36 Rafale aircraft and our Air Force personnel are  happy about it. The present Aadhaar Bill has some  amendments proposed in the backdrop of the Supreme Court judgement and seeks  to address the issues of privacy and probity.  The Hon. Minister has made it clear  that no person shall be denied the benefits of the social welfare schemes in the  absence of the Aadhaar.  The Government has done many such things which have  given solid base for the Aadhaar.  Two or three provisions of the present Bill  are  especially made to remove the earlier discrepancies.  Earlier, some people were  looting the benefits meant for the poor.  Now the Aadhaar has eliminated those  people and the schemes are being implemented smoothly.  The Government has  saved Rs. 90,000 crore by linking schemes with Aadhaar.  This amount would  prove to be a relief to the poor.\",\n          \"I stand against this Motion. I wonder how  Lok Sabha can speak in different voices. The Lok Sabha should speak in one voice.  Is this Government a Government of one community or one religion or is it the  Government of the people of all religions of the country? I believe this country has  no religion. I respect Maryada Purushottam Ram. Today, India's 17 crore Muslims  are taking themselves to be  strangers and alienated. I will never believe in false and  deceitful things now and will  continue to work within the ambit of the Constitution.  When the Prime Minister replies, will he speak for 140 crore people of India or will  he reply only to  those who care about Hindutva? Let me stand as a tall Indian  Muslim and say that the light of Indian democracy is at its dimmest today.   I would like to highlight the status of  the Indian economy since the pre-Independence era. After we got our Independence  in 1947 from British rule, India\\u2019s GDP was only about one per cent of the world\\u2019s  GDP. Our Government at that time faced the biggest challenge of nation-building.  Many things had to be taken care of. Poverty was the biggest threat to our nation at  that point in time. The Green Revolution and White Revolution were focused upon  to improve agricultural production and milk production. In 1991, the economy of the  country opened up and improved under the capable leadership of the then Prime  Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao and the Finance Minister Dr Manmohan Singh.  After assuming office, our Hon. Prime Minister promised that two crore jobs would  be offered to people every year and that the prices of gas and petrol would be halved.  Adding further it was also claimed that the exchange rate of the US dollar would be  reduced but even after ten years today there is no mention of these things in the  White Paper presented  by the Government. It does not find mention of  demonetization, its effects and achievements. All the opposition parties have been  asking for the same. The whole exercise of demonetization seems futile as there is  no mention of the same. This Government has only increased the cess throughout  the country since 2014. Over the last two years, the Government has imposed  windfall tax on oil companies. This windfall tax is for making excessive profits and  it has been informed that the cost of petrol and diesel is now market-driven and not  under their control. The Government claims to have alleviated 25 crore people out  of poverty but it is far from the truth. During the COVID period, eighty crore people  had to be provided free rations which is something commendable. Now after that  pandemic is over, the same promise has been repeated for the next five years. The  dependence of 80 crore people, which accounts for  55 per cent of the country's  population, on free ration for sustenance is a sad state of affairs. With reference to  the scams highlighted by the Hon. Minister, I would like to ask the Government why  no action had been taken by the present Government during their rule for ten years.  The Government is only interested in making accusations against the Opposition. A  Commission should have been set up to inquire into the CAG report to bring out the  truth.  Our party is of the opinion that before the next  Lok Sabha general elections, the game of making serious allegations and counter- allegations and proving each other wrong and anti-people by issuing black papers  and white papers between the Congress Party and the BJP is nothing but selfishness.  How can the country, public interest and public welfare be possible through such  narrow politics? Today, crores of people of the country are constantly suffering from  stressful life due to high inflation, immense poverty, unemployment, plight of  farmers and plight of rural India etc. It is very important for all political parties to  give up selfishness and hatred etc. and make a united effort on the most pressing  national problems of the country. The correct assessment of the policy and activities  of every Government depends on the better livelihood of the people and their  happiness and happy life. The record of both the Congress and BJP Governments in  this matter is neither remarkable nor commendable. If the record of UPA's 10-year  tenure had been excellent then BJP would not have got a chance to come to power  in the country. Similarly, if the tenure of the present Government in the last 10 years  had been excellent in terms of public interest, public welfare, national interest, social  and religious harmony, peace and order etc., then crores of people would  have  never  been so troubled and miserable in every sphere of life. Lack of expected  increase in the per capita income of the people of the country, big capitalists  becoming more prosperous, SC, ST and OBC reservations being made inactive and  ineffective and no significant reduction in corruption in common life, are some of  the issues for public interest. There are specific issues which continue to disturb  people and which are diverting the country from its ambitious objective of equitable  and welfare development. It would have been good if the development of the  country's economy had been employment-oriented rather than employment-free and  the benefits of this development would have been available to all sections of the  society. I demand that the way you have honoured Karpoori Thakur ji with Bharat  Ratna, in the same way if you honour Shri Kanshi Ram with Bharat Ratna then crores  of Dalits, backward classes, Muslims, people of all sections of the society will  be  happy. This white paper is not a white paper but an  election stunt. This is an attempt to hide all the failures of the government. It is  regrettable that the order for the release of a drug-related criminal in Manipur comes  from the Chief Minister's office. Another report came regarding the Ayushman  Bharat scheme as to what kind of corruption is happening in Ayushman Bharat  today. The audit noted that around 7.5 lakh beneficiaries were registered against the  same mobile number and no verification was done. Claims are being filed in the  name of 90 thousand people who have died. No action is being taken on that. Today  ED has become another arm of BJP. ED's job is to catch the corrupt. But today ED  is their special weapon to suppress democracy and the voice of opposition and how  to include corrupt people in the BJP. Had they allowed ED to work, it would have  caught all the people who have absconded abroad today. There are about 31 people  abroad who owe a debt of Rs 40 thousand crore, but today ED is not  apprehending them. If the Prime Minister is so powerful in the world then why does  he not bring back these people hiding abroad? The average GDP growth in UPA was 6.8  per cent whereas the average GDP growth in this Government has reached to 5.9 per  cent. The Fiscal Deficit as a Percentage of GDP was 4.7 percent during the tenure of  UPA whereas during this Government, it remained 5.1 percent average. Inflation  was 8 percent in the UPA Government whereas, it was 5 percent in this Government,  but is it not true that the global oil prices between 2008 and 2014 were more than  100 dollars per barrel, while the prices of oil between 2015 to 2021 were in the range  of $ 55 and $ 70. If GDP was 5.9 percent during the NDA regime, then what about  the rate of unemployment? Why has the Prime Minister not undertaken an  employment survey since 2011? The consumption survey has not been conducted  since 2017. The dollar was at Rs 43 during the year 2005, while it reached to Rs 83  during 2014. How did it reach to $ 83? There is a net increase of 40 rupees. The  foreign currency reserve was at $ 294 billion in 2011. By the year 2013, it rose to  256 billion. Health expenditure from pocket which was 69 percent in the year 2005  has increased to 64.2 percent in the year 2014. In the White Paper at least you give  the data for the year 2020. This white paper is more rhetoric than substantive. Make  a White Paper showing the number of Muslims including Akhlaq who were mob  lynched during the years 2014 to 2024. How many houses were demolished by  bulldozers? Finally, during the UPA regime, there was provision of free coaching in  minorities budget, which they have stopped. They closed the Maulana Azad  Foundation, they stopped the Maulana Azad Fellowship. They have abolished  Madrasa education. During 2014 there was a Muslim Minister, now there is none. This White Paper was a  comparison of two Government tenures of a decade of each. There was nothing but  allegations against the previous Government.  This White Paper is not a White Paper.  It is a politically coloured paper. The unemployment rate during UPA was 2.2 per  cent, while during the present Government, it is 6.6. per cent. The average GDP  growth rate during the previous Government was 8.13 percent which is 5.6 percent  now. Regarding the fiscal deficit data, if you take the entire tenures together, the  fiscal deficit during Dr. Manmohan Singh Ji\\u2019s Government was 4.48 percent while  during this  Government it was 5.8 per cent. Jan Dhan was a product which was  started earlier and there were 34 crore bank accounts. Eventually, they took it to 51  crore accounts which is not a great achievement. Average expenditure during the  UPA Government was 14.68 per cent of the GDP while during this Government it  was 12.94 per cent. They always say that spending has gone up which is not the case.  Be it education and health care during the earlier Government, if you comparatively  take the cumulative figure, the budget outlay of the whole year, the spending on  health care and education is much lesser now than it used to be before. They have  started a cashless economy that they wanted to and they have started a digital  economy. In the digital sphere, you know what has happened to Paytm. It is almost  like money laundering through Paytm. So, what is the Government doing for the  economy? There is a Bhim app now. The Bhim app is hardly used by people. The  IT Committee report has already flagged this. So, these are very serious concerns.  Let us do something constructive and serve this nation.  This is a white paper related to the dark  clouds that have been hovering around the country for ten years and there is no  mention of demonetization, the loss of the economy, the foreign policy of the  country, China's continuous intrusion inside the country, the misuse of ED in it. In  the tribal-dominated state of Jharkhand, an attempt was made to forcibly bring down  a tribal Chief Minister. Executive, Income Tax, CBI, and ED have been grossly  misused in ten years. They have failed to meet the promises they made before 2014.  They are ending the reservation given to SC, ST, and OBC in lieu of atrocities done  on them for thousands of years through privatization. The Government is  manipulating to award of contracts, tenders etc to their favourites and they are calling  themselves corruption-free. The Government is running because of ED, CBI and  Income Tax, otherwise, they do not have the strength to fight with any party. This Amendment law brought in the House is  regarding water pollution. If we talk about air pollution, then India is also included in  the world's 10 most toxic cities, wherein even breathing is risking life. Among the 122  countries across the world where water pollution is a sensitive issue, India ranks 120  out of 122 countries. Even in Assam, our Central Pollution Control Board has  mentioned that out of 10 rivers, there are 11 very polluted stretches. untreated waste,  whether from industry or our homes, is getting dumped into our rivers every day. You  have spent around Rs 12,000 crore on 'Namami Gange'. There are many tanneries,  chemical industries, slaughterhouses, textile industries, etc. on the banks of the  Mother Ganga River. These industries also want to clean up their industry emissions  and for that, they need support that includes funds, credits and technology. Will the  Central Government provide assistance to such small and medium-scale industries? At  the same time, I also would like to ask the Government that how vigilantly it will  monitor the big industries regarding water pollution. We are neither making any rules  nor listing categories. We demand that more details should be included in the bill. We  would like to ask why there is no mention of the State Government in this Bill. If you  want to exempt, do so, if you want to issue a gazette notification then do so, but do so  after consultation with the state government. Today, in our country, due to ever  increasing population, further urbanization will also take place. Keeping this problem  in mind, you should have brought a strong law and not the feeble one that you are  bringing. I rise here to speak on the Interim Budget  2024-25. Since 2014, we all have been listening to \\u2018Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas\\u2019. I want  to ask one thing to the hon. Finance Minister. Whose \\u2018Vikas\\u2019 are you talking about?   Let me be very clear that you are not definitely talking about the \\u2018Vikas\\u2019 of the  farmers.  In this Budget, under major Union schemes, funds for the Formation and  Promotion of 10,000 Farmer Producer Organisations have been slashed by 39 per  cent. The Finance Minister talked about Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana in her  speech but ended up reducing the amount for this scheme by 21 per cent as compared  to the last year.  In West Bengal, the Chief Minister has tripled the farmers\\u2019 income. I  will remind the Finance Minister about the funds which are still due to the State of  West Bengal. Funds for the Regional Connectivity Scheme, AMRUT Scheme, and  Smart City Mission have been slashed by 60 per cent to 35 per cent. In the Ministry of  Civil Aviation, funds have been slashed to 26 per cent.  We used to buy rice and  wheat at Rs. 24 per kg and 15 per kg. Now it is Rs. 42 per kg and 28 per kg  respectively. There is a BJP Government in 80 percent of states but there are no  women Chief Minister or Women Finance Minister in any of them.  ADV. A. M. ARIFF:  Before going into the details of the Budget, I would  like to ask a few pertinent questions about the claims that India will become the third  largest economy in the world soon and our economic growth will be 7.5 per cent in  2023-24. Why is the vibrant growth claimed not by the Government reflected in the  lives of the common people of this country?  The common people are made to suffer  by the increase in the prices of cooking gas as well as essential commodities.  The  price of subsidized domestic LPG cylinders has increased to Rs. 1000.  The petrol  prices are the highest in the world while five per cent own more than 60 per cent of  the country\\u2019s wealth, the bottom 50 per cent possess only three per cent. I would like  to raise a pertinent issue regarding neglect towards the non-BJP-ruled States of the  country including Kerala. Karnataka, Kerala, Telangana and Tamil Nadu States are  suffering at the hands of the Union Government. Instead of supporting the State  Governments by giving their due share, the Government is squeezing them. The  devolution of Central taxes has been drastically reduced from 3.875 per cent to 1.9 per  cent. The Hon'ble Finance Minister in her Budget  Speech has just made a blank hypothesis of  social justice as inclusive, all-embracing  and all-inclusive, which implies that   development  covers people belonging to  all  spheres of life.  Universalisation  of education in  the entire society in a  country  is  important for the all-round development of a nation.  In the field of  education,  the seats reserved for the students  belonging to SC / ST and OBC in Kashi  Hindu University  have not been filled by the candidates of those categories by just  putting the tag of an NFS (not found suitable) in these categories and filling  these  vacancies with the candidates of the general category shows hollowness of the  meaningful initiatives taken by the present government in the interests of SC / ST and  OBC students coming under reservation.  About 10 lakh posts are vacant in central  government ministries and departments. The government should provide employment  to the unemployed by taking measures to fill the vacant posts at the earliest. The target  of self-reliant India will be achieved  only when 80 crore countrymen, who are being  provided ration by the government, will get proper employment and jobs.  I request  the government to provide housing to the landless by allotting leases of government  land at the level of Municipal Corporation, Nagar Palika, Nagar Panchayat and Gram  Panchayat so that homeless people can also get houses.  Anganwadi workers/helpers  should be given the status full of  government employees. The central government is  repeatedly ignoring the interests of farmers. I would like to draw attention to the toll  plazas situated on the National Highway and State Highways in my  district and Lok  Sabha constituency,  Bijnor, that toll is already proposed on NH-34 for traffic going  from Najibabad to  Bijnor.  Traffic from Bijnor to Dhampur via NH-734 and NH-709  AD, is already toll  being collected between Kotwali to Dhampur. This  is a two-lane  road used predominantly  by the farmers and local residents of the area. As per the  NHAI policy, all local residents within a radius of 10 km are exempted from toll  charges. Then why the government is still wasting money on the construction of a toll  plaza between Bijnor Kotwali Road? Therefore, I request  to kindly stop the  construction of the toll plaza being built between Bijnor to Kotwali without delay in  the interest of farmers and local residents. The Finance Minister discussed  agriculture and food processing, emphasising the intensified efforts for value addition  to the agricultural sector and raising farmers\\u2019 income. However, the upcoming year's  allocation for this scheme is only Rs 729 crore, marking a 21 percent decrease against  last year's Budget estimates. The Government should consider increasing the financial  assistance allocated to this pivotal scheme. I request the Central Government not to  reduce the allocation of fertilizers for coastal regions that have suffered the brunt of  the cyclones. The Labour Ministry has seen a decreased allocation from Rs. 13,221.73  crore to Rs. 12,531.47 crore. Unemployment is the biggest harm facing the youth of  today. Significant investment needs to be made for employment generation. The  Budgetary allocation of Rs 538 crore for the Centre's Capacity Building and Skill  Development scheme does not seem adequate. Application of Artificial Intelligence is  on the rise, and unfortunately, it is being weaponized against women. It is regrettably  being done via deep fakes, among other reprehensible acts. Higher budgetary  allocation is required to deal with such new threats. The Andhra Pradesh Government  has consistently sought an increase in MGNREGA man-days, proposing an  augmentation from 100 to 150 days for individuals and a total of 16 crore man-days.  Given the prevailing drought conditions leading to rural migration, the State urges the  Central Government to support its economy by enhancing MGNREGA man-hours  and incorporating new initiatives under the scheme. I urge the Government to  formulate and implement a time-bound plan for granting special category status to  Andhra Pradesh promptly, providing the necessary support to address the unfair losses  incurred due to illogical bifurcation. The Polavaram Irrigation Project is a project of  national importance and it is of huge importance for the people of Andhra Pradesh.  The total cost of the project is Rs.55,548.87 crores at the 2017-18 price level as  approved by the Technical Advisory Committee. However, this Revised Cost  Estimate is not yet approved by the Central Government. Further, funding for Phase-1  completion has been limited to Rs.12,911.15 crore but this amount is inadequate for  providing rehabilitation and resettlement to the 36 additional villages and 48  habitations. Hence, the Andhra Pradesh Government submitted a proposal of Revised  Cost Estimates of Rs.17,144.06 crore for Phase-1 of the project which includes the  cost of such rehabilitation as well. It is requested that the Revised Cost Estimate be  approved by the Technical Advisory Committee and the Revised Cost Estimate for  Phase-1 and provide compensation of  the additional cost of Rs.4222.91 crore incurred  by the Andhra Pradesh Government for resettlement and rehabilitation. Production  activities in all NTC mills were suspended from March 2020 due to the COVID-19  pandemic. The Central Government should take immediate action to make the NTC  mill in Tirupati fully functional to provide relief and support to the BPL families  through its operations. In the Rajya Sabha recently, the Hon. Education  Minister said that 32 thousand students dropped out of higher education midway, out  of which 52 percent of students belong to the SC, ST and OBC categories. It is a very  serious matter. I demand that Dalit, exploited, backward and vulnerable people may  be enrolled on zero balance and efforts need to be taken to educate them. According to  the statement of the present Government, lakhs of youth have been offered  Government jobs in mission mode, but it has remained just an election Jumla. Nearly  10 lakh posts are lying vacant in the Union Ministries and Departments. As on March  1, 2021, only 30.55 lakh employees are working against 40.35 lakh sanctioned posts.  The Government should take measures to fill these vacancies at the earliest and  provide employment to the unemployed. The Government says that arrangements  have been made to provide free ration to 80 crore countrymen. If you work to give  free ration to 80 crore people in this country,  it shows the scale of  unemployment in  our country. You are not giving employment to a poor person, but you are doing the  work of giving ration to him/her. If the Government talks about making an Atma  Nirbhar Bharat,  provide a Government job to the families of these 80 crore people  based on  their qualifications. The Government introduced the Pradhan  Mantri Awas  Yojana. If the Government  wants to make this scheme a reality, landless people ought  to be given  residential leases on  the Government owned land in the Municipal  Corporation, Nagar Palika, and Nagar Panchayats, and work on making them part of  the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. There is also a mention of women empowerment.  In this context, I would like to say that 44,5256 cases related to atrocities against  women have been registered in the year 2022,  meaning thereby  about 51 FIRs per  hour. This makes us think that the Government has failed to protect women. The  Government has arranged Ayushman cards for Anganwadi workers. It is a good  initiative of the Government but their honorarium is very low.  By affording them the  status of Government servants, the Government can certainly offer them a dignified  life. The Government repeatedly ignores the interests of the farmers. According to the  recent NCRB data, the highest numbers of 12,227 suicides have been committed by  farmers and agricultural workers in Maharashtra, due to loss of crops, loss of land and    non-repayment of loans, etc. Therefore, it is very sad and concerning to ignore the  lives of the people reeling under poverty, unemployment, inflation, etc. I would like to  draw your attention to the toll plazas situated on the National Highway in Bijnor and  Nagina parliamentary constituency in my home district. A free toll is already proposed  for vehicles plying from Bijnor via NH-34. It is a two-lane road used by farmers and  local residents of the area. No commercial vehicle passes through this road. According  to the NHAI, all local residents within a radius of 10 km have been exempted from  toll, yet why is the government wasting money on the construction of a toll plaza  between Bijnor and Kotwali Road? I request you to kindly stop the construction of the  toll plaza between Bijnor and Kotwali. By using new words and  technologies, our Finance Minister has presented this confusing and misleading  budget, which is a gimmick in itself. It has been mentioned that the Government is  providing food grains free of cost to 80 crore people in this country. It means the  Finance Minister has accepted that 80 crore people are still living below the poverty  line. A few years ago, the Finance Minister mentioned that we are going to become a  five trillion dollar economy very soon. I do not know whether we have achieved that  target or not. The Finance Minister has mentioned that our total tax collection has  increased threefold during these years. Then why are people still languishing in abject  poverty? The MUDRA scheme was launched and our young boys and girls  approached banks to get the benefits of this scheme. But later the banks stopped  providing MUDRA loans to the poor and needy youths of this country. We often talk  about 'Annadaata', our farmers. However, we do not take any initiative to ensure MSP  for farmers. In my state Maharashtra, our soybean, cotton and pigeon pea-growing  farmers are distressed and they are not getting remunerative prices any more. The  export of soybeans is banned by the Government and they are importing it. So, all the  soybean, cotton etc. producing farmers are facing acute problems. I would like to  request the Union Government to fix MSP. To ensure tele-connectivity and also to  improve the telecommunication network, around 25000 4G towers had to be installed.  But it has not been installed till date in my constituency. Konkan Railway is our pride  and honour. It connects North India with South India. Konkan Railway is a  Government company. I would request the Union Government to dissolve the Konkan  Railway Corporation and acquire it as early as possible. Our per capita income is lesser than in  Bangladesh and Bhutan. Whereas in the case of states per capita income, Bihar is at  the last position.  The Government is targeting minorities and not taking care of the  well-being of Bihar. In the budget, educational schemes such as Skills development  and livelihood programmes are being pulled back. In AMU Kishanganj neither  teaching nor non-teaching staff is inducted nor are funds released.  My demand is to  stop the linking of Kosi and Mechi in the Mahananda basin. Border pitching and  concrete walls should be constructed on them and every year dredging should be done  to check floods. A Government medical college should be allotted to our district.  The  most backward community Surjapuri should be included in the OBC list. A train  should be started for Kishanganj and Seemanchal and attention should be paid to job  opportunities in this region. You claim that you have lifted 25 crore  people above the poverty line. You were giving free ration to 80 crore people, and you  have lifted 25 crore people above the poverty line. In this way, you are assuming that  105 crore people were poor within ten years. This is your achievement of ten years.  You promised that by March 2022, every homeless person in this country will get a  house and not only a house, there will be a tap in the house and there will be water in  the tap, but work on a single house has not even been started. You reduced the budget  of minorities by 38 percent. You have reduced the budget of madrasas. You have  reduced the pre-matric scholarship. You want Children of minorities, especially of  Muslims, should only set up tea stalls, make punctures, and drive auto rickshaws.  ASHA workers and Anganwadi workers agitate every few months. Those ASHA  workers get seven thousand rupees. Even after working hard, Anganwadi workers get  15 thousand rupees. The loans of big industrialists have been written off by the banks.  There are 3,330 government schools in my constituency Aurangabad which do not  have pucca roofs and these children study under tin sheds.  \\uf02aSHRI SUNIL DATTATRAY TATKARE: Under the able leadership of the  Prime Minister, this new Parliament Building has been constructed. Being a part of  NDA, today I rise to support and appreciate this Interim Budget. Our Prime Minister  performed wonderfully during the last ten years and that has helped to build  confidence and trust. Shrimati Nirmala Sitaraman ji has presented a very balanced and  progressive budget. Our government is focusing on infrastructure development and we  have constructed a 22 km long Setu. This coastal road infrastructure would also help  to connect the Agardanda-Turmadi, Vela-Diveagar, and Baghlan sea bridges too in  future. Through the Khelo India scheme, our government has promoted sports and  sportspersons in our country. Our economy is also growing at a fast pace and we are  one of the largest economies in the world. Through cooperative federalism, we are  moving forward and supporting our Maharashtra State. I am hopeful that Janjira Fort,  constructed by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, will be spared by the Archaeological  Survey of India and new development works will be carried out by our Government  by providing more funds. Under the leadership of Shri Eknath Shinde, we would be  there to support this Government and will carry forward the rich and varied heritage of  our Maharashtra for its overall development. I am hopeful that the Government will  definitely take steps to develop the 720 km long coastline of Maharashtra and bring  positive changes in the lives of fishermen.    This government has disappointed on  every front in the interim budget 2024-25. Input costs are increasing due to inflation,  and farmers' incomes are decreasing. The government has still not listened to the  demands of the farmers which shows that the government is not sensitive towards the  condition of farmers in the country. There is not even a single serious step taken by  the government to bring black money.  The government should bring a white paper on  the steps taken by the government to bring back black money. The budget fails to  address measures to check inflation and generate employment. It clearly reflects that  the slogan of \\\"Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas\\\" is a mirage for the marginalized groups in  the country. The unemployment rate is as high as 20% in a few states.  The  government is not concerned about the issues of the youth of the country. There is  nothing in this budget for the salaried middle class.  They don't even consider the  impact of household inflation and price rise on them. Rubber producers in Kerala are  not receiving adequate compensation for their products compared to the cost of  production.  I strongly urge the government to establish a minimum price of Rs 250  per kilogram for rubber. Compounded rubber (CR) will continue to be imported at nil  duty from ASEAN countries. There was not a word in the budget on the government's  intention to legalise minimum support price (MSP) or on providing guaranteed  income to farmers. The budget has nothing concrete about alternative energy, despite  the skyrocketing prices of CNG, petrol and diesel. This Government is adamant  enough not to provide any sort of financial relief to the common people. Viksit Bharat  is nothing but an amorphic idea being propagated by this government. The concept of  GeM is exorbitantly costly. On the Gem portal, the applicant or the aspirant has to pay  0.5 percent of the contracted amount. Due to the suspension of recruitment  notifications, the future of youths in the country is uncertain. I oppose the  government's Agniveer scheme. Agniveer will not get the status of martyr, he will not  get the pension, he will not get gratuity. They will not get any other facilities. The  total FDI inflow declined to 7.8 percent in the second quarter of 2023. Over 90  percent of the investment has been directed towards non-manufacturing sectors  despite the 'Make in India' initiative. The CAG reports have declared that this  Government is a failure in every sector. Flight delays persist as a prevalent issue in the  country, affecting air travel reliability. Jute producers operating in the country do not  get minimum support prices because procurement is not done. This golden fibre  should be promoted. The problem of erosion by rivers in my constituency should be  controlled by the centre and the state jointly.  THE MINISTRY OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE A paltry allocation has been made for the  Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) in the interim Union Budget 2024- 25, which is a matter of concern. The total allocation for the welfare of the SCs is Rs  1,65,598 crore and for the STs, Rs 1,21,023 crore; whereas, the total estimated  expenditure in the budget is Rs 51,08,780 crore. The funds under Pradhan Mantri Adi  Adarsh Gram Yojana were released for less than 40 percent of approved villages. This  results in setbacks to the scheme's objectives due to limited fund releases. The  allocation towards Venture capital for Dalits has been drastically reduced from Rs 70  crore to Rs 10 crore. Dalits, women and other marginalised sections of the society had  to face a strong wave of atrocities against them across the country.  It is evident that  allocations for crucial schemes related to skill development and livelihoods, as well as  the educational and social upliftment of minorities, have been reduced this time. In the  year 2023-24, the education scheme for madrasas and minorities was reduced by 93  per cent to Rs 10 crore as compared to the previous year. This time, it has been further  reduced to a mere Rs 2 crore. This time, the budget for the pre-matric scholarship for  minorities has been reduced to 326.16 crores. Further reductions in the funds and the  closure of many such schemes will be detrimental to the minorities in India. This  would harshly affect the participation and enrolment of students belonging to the  minority community, particularly girls and women. The actual disbursement of  incentives for LSEM PLI turned out to be only Rs 1,655 crore. The incentives  disbursed in the first two years amount to less than 2 percent of the total scheme  outlay. The current Government is talking about the  four strong pillars of developed India which are youth, women, farmers and poor  people but today, the youths of the country are unemployed. The youths is very  disappointed. MSME enterprises which are capable of providing employment are also  continuously declining. The people who are capable of providing employment are  leaving the country due to tax terrorism. Violence against women is continuously  increasing. India has the highest number of cases of wasting and stunting in babies.  Farmers are not being provided subsidies. Be it vegetables, milk, cylinder or petrol,  inflation is increasing. The Government is talking about IITs, Triple IITs, Universities  and AIIMS. AIIMS buildings are ready in Raebareli and Gorakhpur. But, the  Government is not capable of providing staff and equipment to the said AIIMS. This is fully an electoral budget. This  country has the highest taxation system and despite that, no social security efforts  have been made. Attempts have been made to plunge the country into debt with false  promises. The Government neither provided employment, petrol, or diesel nor  reduced the inflation but they burdened each person with the debt of more than one  lakh rupees. I think this budget is a non-sequitur. The  capitalists, the industrialists and the richer people will be happy in this budget. The  poor, the middle-class people, the farmers and labourers will fail to get rid of their  economic problems. There is no mention of unemployment and price hikes. The fund  of Awas Yojna has been stopped only for West Bengal. The money of different  central schemes is not given to West Bengal. On the other hand, the Hon\\u2019ble Chief  Minister of West Bengal has declared to give the wages of 21 lakhs 100 days workers  by 21st February 2024. I am protesting this budget because it is meaningless to the  poor and middle-class people. I stand to speak in support of  the Constitution (Jammu and Kashmir) Scheduled Castes Order (Amendment) Bill,  2023 and the Constitution (Jammu and Kashmir) Scheduled Tribes Order  (Amendment) Bill, 2023. In Maharashtra, farmers' agitation for loan waiver and  Maratha reservation is going on. The Bharatiya Janata Party had promised  reservation to the Dhangar community 10 years ago. The Lingayat Samaj, Muslim  Samaj, Bhamta, Ramoshi, Takari and those who are VJNTs want to be included  under ST. There was also a demand for reservation for Dhangar and Lingayat  communities from the state of Karnataka. If an inclusive Bill is brought for the  entire country, then every State will get justice. The Constitution (Jammu and  Kashmir) Scheduled Castes Order (Amendment) Bill, 2023 amends the  Constitution (Jammu and Kashmir) Scheduled Castes Order, 1956. The Order lists  the castes deemed to be Scheduled Castes in the Union Territories of Jammu and  Kashmir and Ladakh. The Constitution (Jammu and Kashmir) Scheduled Tribes  Order (Amendment) Bill, 2023 amends the Constitution (Jammu and Kashmir)  Scheduled Tribes Order, 1989 to create a separate list for Scheduled Tribes for  Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.  The two Bills are clubbed  together.After abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A, the people of Ladakh thought  that they would get justice. Today the people of Ladakh are demanding statehood  and inclusion in the Sixth Schedule. In 2003, our Union Ministry constituted a  High Power Committee with the objective of ensuring the protection of land and  employment for the people of Ladakh. But the people of Ladakh are still deprived  of this. I would request that the Government should also think about Ladakh and  the Gorkha people living in Darjeeling, West Bengal should also be brought under  the purview of the Sixth Schedule.    THE MINISTER OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT The Public Examinations (Prevention of  Unfair Means) Bill, 2024, has brought different stages and \\u2018unfair means\\u2019 has been  categorised under clause 3 of the Bill. All these categories are already covered by  the Indian Penal Code and Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 also which has been  passed but has not yet been implemented. There is no deficiency of laws to cover  these criminal activities, but the problem is the implementation. That is the greatest  failure in our country today. I am not objecting to anything, but still, I am saying  that all the activities are already covered. Existing laws are there. You are further  categorising it, making a sub-category, but in a broader sense, it all exists. Our  young generation is honest.  Our young generation will develop our country.  We  believe and we have trust.  But if there is one or there are two persons, segregate it,  please.   For the commitment of a criminal activity by one or two persons, the rest  should not suffer.  The Central Government must look into that. Please do not go  on the basis of the media trial.  Of course, the provisions are good.  I would seek  one clarification from the hon. Minister. If impositions of penalty are different,  which law would be followed? This Government is finally giving  respect to the Valmiki Community through the Scheduled Caste Order and the Koli  Community and the Pahari Ethnic Group through the Schedule Tribe order. What  is this Government doing with the SCs, STs and OBCs across the Country? Has it  been fulfilling the reservation facilities already in vogue in other parts of the  country? Has there been any specific object to uplift the people of Jammu and  Kashmir by the Government of India? That needs to be clarified. No specific  projects or ideas have been tabled in the House to improve the lives of the people  of Jammu and Kashmir. Only the implementation of the reservation policy will not  serve the purpose. The provision of punishment for atrocities on backward people  has not been highlighted. In 2022 alone, there were nearly 60,000 atrocities against  the Schedule Castes and 10,064 atrocities against the Schedule Tribes. As per the  NCRB data, the crime against tribals has been increasing year after year. Just in 2  years, from 2020 to 2022, there has been nearly 22 per cent increase in crimes  against tribals. Madam, the gross enrolment ratio of SC and ST students at the  undergraduate level is at 23 per cent and 17.2 per cent respectively whereas the  national average is 26.3 per cent. The Eklavya Schools are meant for SC and ST  students. But, still, 38,000 vacancies across the country have not been filled up.  You are setting up schools, Colleges and Universities if the vacancies have not  been filled. Students will come and there will be no teachers to teach me, how will   their education takes place. We have witnessed that the amount allotted for the  Union Government\\u2019s Umbrella Scheme for Development of Scheduled Castes and  the Umbrella Programme for Development of Scheduled Tribes has been  underspent. Sir, these schemes underspent nearly 28 per cent and 24 per cent of the  amount respectively. Please restore the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir to these  people. In the name of demonetization, the people of the country were made to  stand in queues, many lost their lives. Terrorism has not stopped to date. Our  soldiers are sacrificing their lives every day. You are hurting the federal structure.  Ministry spent only 20 per cent less than what they were allotted. We need more  schemes for the welfare of students and also for the welfare of SCs, STs, OBCs  and minorities. We have started the Kanyashree scheme which is benefitting 78  lakh women in West Bengal and which has been recognised by the United Nations.  Mamta Didi's Government has set up a Scheduled Caste Advisory Council which  does not exist in any state. If we truly want to move forward with those thoughts,  then we should take everyone along.  I support these two Amendment Bills  i.e. Constitution (Jammu and Kashmir) Scheduled Castes Order (Amendment) Bill,  2023 and the Constitution (Jammu and Kashmir) Scheduled Tribes Order  (Amendment) Bill, 2023 which are related to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.   The living conditions of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in this country are  very poor. The Government is also not taking care of the welfare of Scheduled  Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the country. The budget allocation under SEP and   TSP for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes has decreased.  In many of the  areas, SC/ST fund allocation has also got lapsed. SC/ST funds in different  Ministries are also not being spent timely.  Atrocities among the Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled Tribes are increasing day by day throughout the country, especially  in the northern part of India. We have the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled  Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act to deal with it, but it is not being  implemented properly. Another important issue is unemployment.  There is a long- pending demand from the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities to  have special recruitment in the Government sector as well as the private sector. I  would appeal to the Ministers to take the necessary steps to conduct a special drive  to fill up the backlog vacancies of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in  their sectors.  The Post-Matric Scholarships are not given timely.  Our SC and ST  students are facing serious problems.  They are solely dependent on scholarships  for their studies but the Government is not taking any serious steps to release the  money for the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe students.  Another long- pending demand is related to the Dalit Christians. They should be included in the  Scheduled Castes List.  I would like to appeal to the Hon. Social Justice and  Empowerment Minister to consider this also. Our country is the biggest democratic and  secular country in the world. However today, our Constitutional rights and freedom  are being denied. If you undertake a critical analysis of the achievements of the  past ten years as stated by the hon. President of India, you will notice that all of  these are a result of the work of previous Governments but the current Union  Government takes credit for everything. The widely publicised Pradhan Mantri  Awas Yojana\\u2013Urban and the AMRUT Scheme was basically a reframing of the  Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission launched much before in 2005.  India is a Socialist Republic, one that should be dedicated to the welfare of the  marginalised without only serving the interests of the one per cent. The Union  Government is also proposing disinvestment in the steel sector PSUs which have  existed almost since the Independence of the country. Starting from 2022 to 2023,  for three consecutive years, the Budget allocated for the agricultural sector has  been decreasing. The word \\u2018Secular\\u2019 also seems to be unfamiliar to the Ruling  Party. While India\\u2019s greatest strength lies in the absence of a singular ethnic or  social identity defining the nation, it appears that the current Government is  leaning towards portraying the country, as a \\u2018Hindu Rashtra\\u2019. This is in stark  contrast to the glorious values of secularism enshrined in our Constitution.  Important issues like economic turmoil, the Manipur Conflict, poor infrastructure  and unemployment are being put on the back burner, rarely featuring in the  discussions of this House. This is the first time in Indian history  that 146 Opposition Members were suspended and the present Government has  passed several important Bills without any discussion. This is a huge threat to our  democracy. The situation in Manipur is still unstable even after eight months of the  incidents. It is astonishing that there is no mention of the Manipur issue in the  President's Address. Madam President did not say anything when women wrestlers  were being manhandled and inhumanly dragged by cops during their peaceful  protest.The country witnessed the rapists and murderers of the Bilkis Bano case  being garlanded after their unjustified release much before the completion of their  imprisonment term. And on other critical issues of national importance, like rising  unemployment and inflation, Madam President continues to remain silent. The  report of the Global Hunger Index of 2023 gives India a rank of 111 out of 125  countries. This indicates an alarming level of hunger severity in the country. The  NCRB report of 2023 shows crimes against Scheduled Castes went up by 13 per  cent and against Scheduled Tribes by 14.3 per cent. Reserved seats meant for  Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are lying vacant in different Government  institutions and departments. Appropriate action is not being taken to fill up these  vacant posts. Child rape cases also witnessed a staggering 90 per cent increase  from 2016 to 2022 as per analysis of NCRB data. It is clear that in reality when it  comes to the actual well-being, socio-economic development and empowerment of  India\\u2019s people, there is really not much that has progressed. In the last decade 16 AIIMS  have been established but none of them is fully functional as per the Press release  of 19th December, 2023 of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. What  remains absent in Madam President\\u2019s Address are issues like unemployment,  which is a burning issue, high inflation, the average commoner compromising with  many essential needs, safety and security of girl child, and MSP for farmers. The  reality of the suffering of ordinary and poor people while travelling by trains across  India has been hidden under the hype of Vande Bharat. As far as the Ujjwala  Yojana is concerned, out of 95.9 million PMUY beneficiaries, 11.8 million did not  get even a single LPG cylinder during the last financial year. The CAG Audit  Report in 2019 revealed the cylinder scam in PMUY.  Thereafter, there were no  reports of CAG on PMUY. I would like to say that the Government is  not  providing a 100 days' fund in West Bengal according to the CAG report. We have  the right to know the name of the States of the country to which you are providing  funds as per the CAG report and also those States to whom you are not providing  it. You talk about enabling the poor to board the aeroplanes, but in economy class,  the minimum domestic flight ticket is available for Rs 30 thousand, Rs 29  thousand. The Government is silent about this also. Women's power is being  discussed everywhere. However, as per the NCRB, in 2013 there were 3,09,546  cases of crimes registered against women. In 2022, it reached to 4,45,256 cases  which shows an increase of 30.48 percent in such crimes.\",\n          \"It is a small Bill, but the gravity of the Bill is  immense as shortcomings exist in the matters related to the court and this Bill  has been brought to rectify them. Without discussing other aspects, I would just  want to say that in the coming days, the judicial process should be very simple,  people should get justice easily and in an affordable manner. This kind of a  system should be in place for all kinds of cases. In the earlier times, the  members of the family and the society used to sit together and find solutions to  such issues, but now a system has evolved that for everything, we have to  approach the court and the cases are not disposed of in time in the court.  Because of this, the people have to face a lot of problems. I would like to make  a small appeal that in all such small issues no one should be punished, if the  people and lawyers of both sides sit together and decide and finally convey their  decision to the court and then we will be able to solve such problemsin large  numbers. Now there is no need for anyone to believe that all the problems will  be solved by enacting a law, and I do not believe at all. I believe that all the  cases should be settled out of the court. It was enunciated by our country  long back about what needs to be done for the people across the world to stem the rot  arising out of the nuclear proliferation. It is alarming to note that still, the world possesses  more than 13,400 nuclear weapons. So, disarmament is the best protection against such  dangers. We have to prepare ourselves for any eventuality. From 1925 to 2017, 10  International Treaties on Weapons of Mass Destruction have been signed. We can't fight  it just by passing laws. Whatever steps are taken to keep our country safe and secure, we  will support them without any hesitation. I rise to support the Weapons of Mass Destruction  and their Delivery Systems (Prohibition of Unlawful Activities) Amendment Bill, 2022.   In Resolution 1540 (2004), the Security Council decided that all States shall refrain from  providing any form of support to actors that attempt to develop, acquire, manufacture,  possess, transport, transfer or use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and their  means of delivery, in particular for terrorist purposes.  The Resolution requires all States  to adopt and enforce appropriate laws to this effect as well as other effective measures to  prevent the proliferation of these weapons and their means of delivery to actors, in  particular for terrorist purposes.  Nonetheless, detecting proliferation-relevant illicit  financing is even harder than detecting money laundering or terrorism financing.  The  risks posed by Weapons of Mass destruction stem not only from ready-made bombs,  nuclear, chemical or radiological material but also from dual-use goods and technology  that are traded, shipped and used globally.  One of the most important areas for the  Government to work upon is on informing the private sector promptly to match changes  in UN designations of entities and individuals.  If the UN Security Council designated  new entities or individuals as proliferators, but a given country failed to update its lists,  what happens is that these financial institutions continue to trade with these entities  because they are not made aware of these changes in time.  So, that is also something that  needs to be considered. I stand here in support of the Bill  that we are discussing today.  India has always had a very good and a positive image of a  peace-loving and peace-making country.  India\\u2019s definition of weapons of mass  destruction is for nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.  So, can we expand it?  I  would like to request that we should consider on broadening the definition of the  Weapons of Mass Destruction.  I would like to talk about some other issues which  nobody else has mentioned the zoonotic diseases.   It is like a pandemic. There is a story  that COVID-19 was attacked which is probably on the globe.  Could we have a broad  discussion on this?  I think that terror-financing is such a thing that must be stopped.  We  support this Bill completely but we must definitely be very careful about the new  technology coming in.  We all are raising our concerns just to make sure that it is a  flawless Bill and make sure that India is known for what it really is. I have a few quick points that I would like to make.    I suggest for consideration of the hon. Minister to attach a schedule to this Bill and list  the Acts, Agreements, and Convention etc which come under the purview of this  legislation.  We have seen umpteen times statements coming from Russia.  If signatories  to the Convention are blatantly breaking it, then, what is the use of this Convention?  We  are going to have the Ninth Review Conference of the Biological Weapons Convention  this year.  I wish to know what would be the approach of India in this Conference, In the  light of ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict,  I wish to know the kind of mechanism and the  national strategy what is in place in the event of a chemical or biological attack.  Several  hon. Members have also asked is about the Corona virus questioning whether it is a  biological attack or not.  I am fully with the hon. Minister and the Government to  ruthlessly crush financing any activity which help in making weapons of mass destruction  and their delivery. As the hon. Minister explained that it is essentially to  make us legally complaint with the mandates of the United Nations Security Council and  the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force.  Could the Minister actually,  throw light as to what steps the Government has taken measures after launch of Brahmos  incident to ensure that something of this sort does not get repeated in future?  In the year  2018, in the Bodh Gaya blast case, the Weapons of Mass Destruction Act was invoked by  the National Investigation Agency.  Could the Minister enlighten us whether chargesheets   were field in terms of these relevant Sections of the WMD Act?  My last point would  relate to our no-first-use posture.  There has a certain amount of ambiguity with regard to  this no-first-use posture.  It would be enlightening to hear from the Minister as to whether  we continue to maintain a no-first-use posture or is there any rethink in Government  which he would like to share with the House? The current conflict in Ukraine is perhaps the most  important  geo-political  event  since  the  pulling  down  of  the  Berlin   Wall in November, 1989.  This war in Ukraine has exposed the limitation of the world  order.  But does it indicate a move towards a new world order?  Everyone is concerned as  to what will happen to the world economy and not just economy of a region or a few  countries, but the ramifications it will have across the world.  We are talking about a  country which is engulfed in a war.  It is not as if the Government did not issue  advisories.  These were exceptional advisories which were issued in the month of January  and registration was opened up.  More than twenty thousand Indians registered  themselves with the Indian Embassy.  But, the situation was so fluid that no one knew for  sure that war is actually going to happen.  All efforts were made to coordinate with  Ukraine and Russia and also other neighbouring countries of Ukraine.  So to expect a  very easy way out, is to expect the moon.  I congratulate the Government for  starting Operation Ganga. The geopolitical tension between Russia and Ukraine has led  to steep increase in prices of global commodities, including prices of crude oil, gas,  edible oils, and fertilizers. As per the feedback received from industry, the exports of  some products like pharmaceuticals, telecom instruments, and coffee and tea from India  are likely to be affected. Evacuation means bringing a person out from the area of crises.  But here, the students had to walk several kilometres and pay exorbitant amount to hire  vehicles to reach the borders. Actually, our Government acted late. The tuition fee in  private medical colleges in India ranges from Rs.60 lakh to Rs.1 crore. This is far beyond  the capacity of middle-class people. Therefore, the students look for relatively less cost- effective institutions in other countries. We are actually unable to provide medical  education at affordable rate inside the country. It is important to see that the career of  these young students does not suffer. In the conflict that is going on between Russia and  Ukraine, thousands of people have been killed and lakhs have been displaced. Weapons  manufacturers are working to earn a lot of profit by selling weapons. Japan and Germany  have spoken of rearming themselves. Europe is rearming itself. Today again a war is  going on between us, which we are witnessing in Ukraine. The entire international  community has completely failed to stop this centuries-long conflict which has turned  into a war. Today, the policy of India is that this war should be stopped by getting this  whole issue peacefully and diplomatically resolved. India has to show great skill to deal  with this matter. We believed in a completely fair foreign policy and we are still  following it. Inflation is increasing in our markets. Be it the price of metals and  petroleum or the price of food items or the price of fertilizers, there is an increase in the  price of everything. Thank you, Chairman Sir. I congratulate and thank  for the historic work done by Hon'ble Minister of External Affairs Jaishankar ji,  Honorable Minister Scindia ji, Honorable Minister Rijiju ji, Honorable Minister Hardeep  Singh Puri ji and V. K. Singh sahib ji Under the leadership of Prime Minister. As I heard  the debate, it seemed that India's foreign policy was made only after 1947 and Nehru ji  founded it. Earlier there was no foreign policy at all. When 5000 people of Poland were  looking for shelter everywhere during the Second World War, then the Raja of Jamnagar  gave shelter to those 5000 people of Poland in Gujarat. It is because of the same Gujarati  connection that the Polish government supported our students, our people. So foreign  policy didn\\u201ft start with Nehru ji. When Bharatiya Janata Party formed the government in  the year 2014-15, it said that now our foreign policy will run on the basis of  Panchamrita. Panchamrita means we will live with dignity. Today foreign policy will be  governed by dialogue. Honorable Prime Minister has such power, this country has such  power that it can save itself in this war and can also stop the war. We have signed an FTA  with Australia for the first time. Foreign policy should be discussed in this country, who  made China our neighbor? You say that we always abuse Nehru, we abuse Congress.  The situation in Ukraine is not self-made like we are  seeing in Sri Lanka today.  Vladimir Putin\\u201fs dream is becoming Ukraine\\u201fs nightmare.  The threat of chemical war is also a major concern. Russia unfolded its hybrid war  against Ukraine. The stand taken by India, be it at the UN Security Council or at QUAD  Foreign Ministers\\u201f meeting at Melbourne is welcome. This is the stand of India, that  cooperation and collaboration will help douse the conflict between Russia and Ukraine  and ensure long-term peace and stability in the region. With pressure mounting from the  West led by the US, we have to make a very difficult strategic choice between principles  and values on one side and pragmatism and interest on the other. The time has come  where we need to move closer to the US and the QUAD Summit in May this year is one  such opportunity for India. we have been adopting a non-aligned approach. We have  taken sides or worked closely with world powers only when national interest is involved.   in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, I do not see any national interest involved. I  have a few economic bullet points. More than 500 million dollars\\u201f worth of exporters  payments are stuck in Russia due to sanctions. Ukraine is the third largest producer and  exporter of maize and Ukraine and Russia are also top two exporters of sunflower oil  which we import. Russia is also the world\\u201fs second largest exporter of muriate of potash  fertilizer which we import. Out of 5.09 metric tonnes that we import, one-third come  from Belarus and Russia. Ukraine is the third largest supplier of urea to India. We are  also importing crude oil from Russia, Exports from India like medicines, tea, etc. to  Russia are impacted due to shipment concerns and there is also shortage of containers. A  carefully calibrated stand by New Delhi has created a distinctive space for diplomacy by  not only maintaining equi-distance between the two powers but also moving towards a  multipolar world. Sir, it sounds like music that the  statesmanship of Pandit Nehruji has been remembered again given the contemporary  political and diplomatic situation prevailing across the world. Shri Kiren Rijiju rightly  said that whoever in the government, they should have fulfilled this responsibility, we are  fulfilling the responsibility. That is our tradition. Still why do we debate? If there is any  mistake, alerting the government, advising the government, this is the duty of the  opposition, which we do. First, I would say that Could we explore any idea that Indian  Parliament could pass a unanimous resolution to suggest both the warring countries of  Russia and Ukraine that they may restrain from their present situation? Jaishankar ji is a  tall and capable foreign minister. I want to ask him a couple of questions, First, does the  Ukraine-Russia conflict really test India's Foreign Policy resilience?, What are the  complications outlining India's restraint?  I support the Constitution (Scheduled  Castes and Scheduled Tribes) Orders (Amendment) Bill, 2022 which seeks to omit the  Entry of Bhogta community from the list of Scheduled Castes and also, it seeks to bring  in certain communities in the list of Scheduled Tribes. We must remember Dr. B.R.  Ambedkar\\u201fs remarks that a free society in India is a far distant possibility till the ill- treatment and suppression of one class by the other is there. Equality could also be a  fiction nonetheless one should settle for it as a governing precept. We have to have  equality in the society. Celebration of birthday of Birsa Munda, setting up of Eklavya  Model Residential Schools and announcing scholarship by Prime Minister Modi\\u201fs  Government to the 30 lacs students of these schools shows its commitment towards  tribals. Antodaya, Jal Jeevan Mission and Swachh Bharat Scheme are some of efforts  being made for upliftment of tribals and downtrodden. With the passing of the Constitution (Scheduled  Castes and Scheduled Tribes) Orders (Amendment) Bill, 2022, these communities will  definitely have economic and educational development and they will get the benefit of  development. SC/STs are still at a backstage in the flow of development, it is necessary  to bring them into the mainstream. A distinguished member in the Constituent Assembly  had said that the credit for India's independence will be given to Mahatma Gandhiji and  the credit to codify India's independent regime will be given to Dr. Ambedkar, the great  architect of our great Constitution. There is much more to be done by the society in our  country. Many people from the disadvantaged sections do not know about their rights and  the various programmes being run by the Government in their interests. These  communities should be informed and made aware about welfare schemes. The extension of train no. 12505/06 North-East  Express, Kamakhya- Annand Vihar Terminal, can connect passengers of Jhunjhunu,  Sikar and Jaipur.  Since initial maintenance of train no. 12505/6 is undertaken at  Kamkhaya and it keeps stationed for about ten hours at Annand Vihar Terminal.  By  increasing one rake of this train, this train can ply from Jhunjhunu to Jaipur via Sikar.    What justice stands to mean is that the criminals  should be taken to task and justice be delivered to the victims. This sensitivity is called  for in the judicial system. If we want to build the best country, we will have to enact good  laws. It is said that our eco-system is not in order and then the question arise as to how to  fix it. That\\u201fs why I am making my points on this issue. The conviction rate is merely  14.35 per cent which entails that about 85 per cent of the criminals get scot-free.  Therefore, the faith of the common people in the judicial system is getting undermined.  People say that the police personnel do not conduct scientific investigation. This Bill has  been brought in to make that very scientific investigation possible. The 87th report of the  Law Commission of India reveals that the criminal justice system of the country is very  colonial and heavily tilted in favour of criminal. Hence, good and stern laws are required  to be enacted and enforced properly as well. It is being said repeatedly that the law will  be misused. Let me know which law is not misused. We have so much political will  power that we will not allow it to be misused. I would like to support this Bill  and say that it is very important for the people of the country to understand that even their  single vote is very important for the development of the country. Everyone must vote and  all the facilities to those people should be stopped who do not vote. Compulsory voting is  very important so that we can all actively participate in the democratic process. Voting  I.D. of every voter should be compulsorily linked with his or her Aadhaar so that no one  dares to cast any bogus vote. The Army and paramilitary forces should be exempted from  compulsory voting as they are stationed at different places for the security of the country.  Compulsory voting will also be useful for crime identification as well as for education,  health and economy of the country. Earlier, the voting percentage in Jammu and Kashmir  was very low, but since the abrogation of Article 370, the voting percentage there has  gone up and the democracy is getting stronger. Many youths from Ladakh and other parts  of the country study in different corners of the country. We also need to consider how to  provide voting facilities to these youth. The sport is one topic which  unifies every nation whether we are playing cricket or football or other sports. The beauty  of sports is that it is about discipline, teamwork and a lot of hard work that goes behind.  The contribution of Khelo India Programme is really great. It is a very encouraging step  for the new generation.We should just rise above politics in sports. The infrastructure of  sports has improved. There is some more way for our States to improve our  infrastructure, it is good. Indian cricket is discussed almost like you discuss politics on  every dining table. The IPL is a great success story that India has seen, and a lot of new  talent has come with it. It is the same thing with Kabaddi and Pro-Kabaddi. They even  get financial support because there are sponsors in this game. Today, the BCCI is  autonomous and football league is autonomous, and they are doing a good job. So, the  Government does not necessarily have to interfere but if you can complement each other,  it is overall good for the sports sector. There are two sports, outside of Khelo India, that  we need to promote. One is traditional sports and the other is adventure sports. Adventure  sports is a very big business in tourism. With the unemployment challenges and with the  global crisis, tourism is a very big option and so adventure tourism and traditional  tourism can open up a lot of doors for youngsters who can make their hobby into careers.  Sports unifies society at large and the country at large. Games in India has witnessed various  stages of change from ancient to modern times. There is no dearth of talents in our  country but we cannot win medals in the world competition just by having talents. For  that, we need technology in sports, better training, good exercise, right eating habits and  positive environment. The Government has decided to continue Khelo India scheme for  development of sports during the period of 15th Finance Commission (2021-22 to 2025- 26) with an outlay of Rs. 3165.50 crore. From the year 2017 to 2021, three editions of  Khelo India School and Youth Games, one edition of Khelo India University Games and  two editions of Khelo India Winter Games have been organized. More than 20,000  sportspersons participated in these games out of which about 3,000 sportspersons have  been identified as Khelo India Athletes (KIA) who are getting training in new form of  SAI centres i.e. Khelo India Academies at present. The Government has sanctioned 282  sports infrastructure projects of various types of worth Rs. 2,328 crore during the last five  years. Sports stadiums may be constructed in Shri Karanpur, Shri Vijaynagar,  Sadulshahar and Suratgarh under my Parliamentary Constituency, Shri Ganganagar and Pilibanga and Sangaria under Hanumangarh district under Khelo India scheme. An  archery academy may be set up in Rajasthan. There are several countries where the  dual model of accounting institutes exists. Confusion has been created by the existence of  two titles and both CMAs and CAs co-exist in harmony rendering service to the society.  The 45th Report of Standing Committee clearly recommended for change in nomenclature  of Cost and Works Accountants to Cost and Management Accountants. It is observed that  the Ministry is ignoring the demand of Cost Accountants for more than three decades I  urge the Finance Minister to consider my humble request. Clauses 21, 56 and 89 in the  Bill prevent a complainant from withdrawing the complaint. In any of the Bills, such  prohibition of withdrawals is not found. It is a fundamental right of any individual to  withdraw the case filed by him/her.  I would request the hon. Finance Minister to kindly  consider dropping of clause 32,67 and 100 from the said Bill. We have seen failure of  insolvency and Bankruptcy Law for following timelines given by the courts. Hence, it is  proposed to remove the timelines given in these clauses. Some provisions lack natural  justice to the complainant and respondent by not providing them any opportunity to file a  rejoinder. I rise to oppose the Bill. In this Bill,  changes have been proposed to existing legislations governing the apex Institutes of  Chartered Accountants, Cost Accountants and Company Secretaries. The unprecedented  provisions of appointing two non-CAs as members out of three members in the Board  may have a larger impact as the work of CAs would be majorly judged by non-CAs.  The  Institute of Chartered Accountants of India has raised concerns over the proposal to have  non-Chartered Accountant as the Presiding Officer of its Disciplinary Committee. At  present, the President or the Vice President of ICAI acts as the Presiding Officer, and it is  the practice that the Institute wants to continue. I would like to say that we should trust  our CAs. They have been working for us the last 75 years with much dedication. They are  also the nation builders. So, Let us give them more autonomy rather than taking away the  autonomy and saying that we are providing autonomy.  I would like to speak on the Chartered Accountants,  the Cost and Works Accountants and the Company Secretaries (Amendment) Bill, 2021.  Indian Institute of Chartered Accountants is the only institute in the country. The  Standing Committee itself has given a report in which they have categorically mentioned  that appointing a Chairman or a President for the disciplinary committee from the  bureaucracy is objectionable. The institute has served the country for many years. Even  in finalising the taxation also, they have come forward and helped the Government. As  far as NCLT is concerned, I would like to know from the hon. Minister  that after the  formation of the NCLT, what are the decisions given by the NCLT.  The company which  is having a capital of around thousands of crore of rupees is being sold for a few crores of  rupees. I request the hon. Minister, through you, to please send this Bill to a Select  Committee. Let us discuss it elaborately and let us come up with a very good Bill which  will protect the investors and which will serve the Institute also.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":28}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import nltk\n","from nltk.collocations import BigramCollocationFinder, TrigramCollocationFinder\n","from nltk.metrics import BigramAssocMeasures, TrigramAssocMeasures\n","\n","# Example function to generate bigrams and trigrams for a given text\n","def generate_ngrams(text):\n","    tokens = nltk.wordpunct_tokenize(text)\n","    bigram_measures = BigramAssocMeasures()\n","    trigram_measures = TrigramAssocMeasures()\n","\n","    # Bigrams\n","    bigram_finder = BigramCollocationFinder.from_words(tokens)\n","    bigram_scored = bigram_finder.score_ngrams(bigram_measures.raw_freq)\n","    bigrams = [bigram for bigram, score in bigram_scored]\n","\n","    # Trigrams\n","    trigram_finder = TrigramCollocationFinder.from_words(tokens)\n","    trigram_finder = TrigramCollocationFinder.from_words(tokens, window_size=4)\n","    trigram_scored = trigram_finder.score_ngrams(trigram_measures.raw_freq)\n","    trigrams = [trigram for trigram, score in trigram_scored]\n","\n","    return bigrams, trigrams\n","\n","# Loop through each category and year in combined_speeches\n","for category, year_group in combined_speeches_yearly.groupby(['Category', 'Year']):\n","    category_name, year = category\n","    speeches_for_category_and_year = year_group['Speech'].str.cat(sep=' ')\n","\n","    # Generate bigrams and trigrams for speeches in this category and year\n","    bigrams, trigrams = generate_ngrams(speeches_for_category_and_year)\n","\n","    # Store the results or perform further analysis\n","    print(\"Category:\", category_name)\n","    print(\"Year:\", year)\n","    print(\"Bigrams:\", bigrams)\n","    print(\"Trigrams:\", trigrams)\n","    print()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","output_embedded_package_id":"1xdgmWJQ_q1SMasMnLAUtr6o3qNnQH1qd"},"id":"ryqgPCMknuha","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710795670828,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":14944,"user":{"displayName":"045_Punerva Singh","userId":"02056743895864260867"}},"outputId":"dbbb6c00-2bf1-461c-c21e-73657c553ff6"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Output hidden;

This  is very deep-rooted.  This has especially tarnished the image of people in  politics.  Poor people invest their money because of faith but their entire  investment has been looted.  I feel the steps the Government is taking are very  good.  Hon. Finance Minister should address all the issues raised hon. Members.   More than 250 chit fund companies are there in West Bengal only.  This Bill  should certainly be passed rather it should be made more stringent.  I would like to thank the hon. Prime  Minister and the Minister of Home Affairs for bringing in the Jammu and Kashmir  Reorganization Bill and a Statutory Resolution.  Sardar Ballabh Bhai Patel, Bhim  Rao Ambedkar and Shayama Prasad Mukherjee had opposed the inclusion of the  Article 370 in the Constitution at the time of its inclusion.  But the politics of  vested interests got it included in the Constitution.  What has the Article 370 so far  brought to Jammu and Kashmir?  Article 370 has only widened the gap between  India and Jammu and Kashmir.  It has provided nothing else but unemployment,  corruption and terrorism to the people of Jammu and Kashmir.  No one is ready to  set up a big factory in Jammu and Kashmir as no one can purchase land over there.   I would like to tell you that the people from all over the country are availing of the  benefits of 'Ayushman Bharat Scheme' but the people of Jammu and Kashmir are  deprived of the benefits of this scheme.  This is only because there is no big  hospital nor anyone is ready to set up big hospital there.  The entire country was  celebrating the passing of the Bill which was intended to provide 10 per cent  reservation to the poor of general category but the people of Jammu were  disappointed because this legislation could not be enforced in Jammu and Kashmir.   Hence, the people want that Article 370 and 35A associated with Jammu and  Kashmir should be scrapped.  If the daughters of Jammu and Kashmir are got  married in other States, she has to lose her identity.  All her relations come to an  end.  I would also like to state that the entire country is aware of what happened to  Kashmiri Pandits.  So, Kashmiri Pandits will not be in a position to live with peace  unless and until they are properly rehabilitated.    In fact, Jammu and Kashmir  has been relegated to the category of a backward State only because of the Article  370 and 35A.  The States where  Article 370 is not enforced, people are happy and  prosperous.  The condition of the refugees of West Pakistan is still quite pitiable  though they have been living in Jammu and Kashmir for the last 70 years.  Today,  history will be created here in the House. It is very clearly  mentioned that Article 370 is a temporary provision.  When it is being abrogated,  there is no need to make such an issue out of it.  We have seen that in the passage  of every Bill we find that the provisions of the Bills are applicable to the entire  country except to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.  After the passage of this Bill,  we will not have this anomaly.  We believe that we will have the best governance  after the bifurcated status of the State of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.  The  country is going to be very safe and the real dreams of people will come true in the  coming days.   The Government now should take all initiatives to bring Kashmiri  Pandits back.  With abolition of 35A, I am sure, wonderful developments are going  to take place in fields of tourism, IT and in every other sphere.  Many other  anomalies would be removed and corrected after the passage of this Bill and we  are going to see a beautiful Kashmir hereafter.     My Party and I myself are in support of the  resolution to accord J&K and Laddakh the status of Union Territories.  It has been   a long pending demand.  This move has sent a wave of immense pleasure among  the masses particularly among the Buddhist followers of Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar.   In fact, Dr. Ambedkar happened to make a statement disapproving of the draft of  Article 370 wherein he said on record that the residents of Kashmir have equal  rights to grow in India as is available to the other citizens of the country.  Contrary  to his wishes the citizens of India have been barred from settling down, or  acquiring land or entering into trade and profession in Kashmir.  This is totally  unacceptable.  I support this Bill. This is a historic Bill brought in by  the Government.  I rise to support this Bill on behalf of our Party.  This apart, I  would like to urge upon the hon. Minister to have plan B in  place to convert POK  into IOK somewhere down the line.  Part 2 of the Jammu Reorganization Bill  consists of two main issues.  One of these pertains to the formation of Union  Territory of Laddakh without an assembly Legislature and the other one is  concerning formation of Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir  with an assembly  Legislature.  This is welcome move and has been hailed by the masses concerned.   Earlier, I happened to be part of a delegation to Kashmir and received firsthand  accounts of the pathetic condition people of J&K, who have been reeling under for  years together.  We learnt from the masses that there is no development in J&K  even tourism is in rough patch.  So is the case with employment and industrial  development.  So finding the happy medium seemed to be  the best way forward.  Yesterday, many people were saying that it is a dark day.  How can it be a dark day  if development will reach all the people, employment will be provided, industries  will be set up in Kashmir?  Therefore, it is not a dark day rather it is a  revolutionary day, a day of development.  Yesterday, hon. Home Minister has told  that he will make it number one state in the matter of development in the next five  years.  Jobs will be provided to the Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, youths of Kashmir.   Till now, there was no development in Kashmir, therefore, we are supporting this  Bill due to these promises.  Kashmir is a paradise on earth.  It is sad that we could  not protect beautiful Kashmir for so long. The people of Kashmir are lovely  people. Injustice has been done to them for so long.  We are supporting this Bill to  bring justice to them. It is a historic day when  historical mistakes have been rectified. Ladakh has been neglected for the last 71  years with vehement demand for U.T. status ever since but this never seized the  deserved attention of the powers that be in the past.   Ladakh has its unique culture.  Abrogation of Article 370 will certainly make the future of Jammu and Kashmir  bright.  Every religious organization has demanded U.T. status for Ladakh.  Some  people say that there will be no equality in Jammu and Kashmir in the absence of  Article 370 whereas they themselves meted out step-motherly treatment to Ladakh.   Article 370 has been misused against the minorities in Jammu and Kashmir.  I  thank the Government of India and all the hon. Members who supported this Bill. Our Government has taken a historic  decision and I on my behalf and on the behalf of my Party extend our heartfelt  thanks to hon. Prime Minister and hon. Home Minister.  Until now, we just heard  about the united India but today the country has been united in real terms.  We  ourselves alienated Kashmir from the whole country by inserting the Article 370 in  our Constitution.  Today the leaders of opposition parties have also accepted that  we are fulfilling the promises made by us at the time of election.  Jammu and  Kashmir remained detracted from the path of development and progress for so  many years.  Now it will join the journey of development and progress.  Laddakh  has also got its own identity and after becoming the Union Territory, the wishes of  aspirations of the people of the State will also be fulfilled by this historic decision  taken by our Government. I rise to support the Bill.  Article 370 of our  Constitution, being a temporary provision has to go for the good of the people of  Jammu and Kashmir.  In effect, a historical mistake that took place about 70 years  ago is now being corrected through this Bill.  All sorts of assistance was provided  to the State of Jammu and Kashmir in the past but everything went into drain.  In  return, we got bloodshed and terrorism.  Our own Kashmiri pundits have been  thrown out of Kashmir.  Complete integration of Jammu and Kashmir into India  will be one nation with one flag and one Constitution.  Infrastructural facilities,  peace and prosperity across the region will improve.  The hon. Home Minister is  on record saying that as soon as the situation normalizes, Jammu and Kashmir  would be made as a full-fledged State.  This House may kindly be enlightened if   he has set any timeline in this regard.  I want to know as to what supplemental,  incidental and consequential measures the Government is going to take for Jammu  and Kashmir. I stand in support of the Bill.  My party  Shiromani Akali Dal clearly stands for a strong federal set up but, at the same time,  we believe in a strong and united India.  During partition, when a lot of minorities  shifted from Pakistan to the rest of India and J&K, they were given equal amount  of property or some compensation but the people from Pak Occupied Kashmir or  from Pakistan who migrated to Jammu & Kashmir have not got any compensation  till date.  Minorities of Jammu & Kashmir are depressed and suppressed because  there was no Minority Commission in Jammu & Kashmir.  A lot of residents of  Jammu and Kashmir have settled down in Punjab.  They have bought land in  Punjab but people of Punjab cannot buy land in Jammu and Kashmir.  I  congratulate the Prime Minister and the Home Minister for taking this bold  decision. I rise to support this Bill.  Had Sardar  Ballabh Bhai Patel handled the Kashmir issue, the current situation would not have  emerged.  Kashmiri people have not developed a connect with the rest of the  country only because of this Article 370.  Many important laws are not enforced in  Kashmir due to this Article.  If a Kashmiri girl marries a man from any other State,  she loses her Kashmiri citizenship.  Democracy in the valley has been suppressed  and corruption flourished due to this Article 370.  The Government of India  provides huge packages to this State yet it failed to register development.  So, I  congratulate the Government for today's decision.  This decision is going to change  the history of India, not geography.  The people of who went to Kashmir, even after  70 years, they are still nomads.  This Bill has been brought to deliver justice to  those people.   Even a single Member of Congress party did not utter even a single  word about Reservation Bill because reservation is not in their behaviour.  This  Bill is the last nail in the legislation which you had been legislated against  Kashmir.  From today, the whole India has been united in a true sense.  I am happy  today that our generation is the witness of the time when Article 370 is being  repealed. I feel that we will get the real  independence today with the passage of this Bill.  The credit for this independence  definitely goes to those soldiers who had been fighting and laying down their lives  for this issue for the last 70 years.  I would like to thank the Government for  bringing in this Bill in the very first session.  I believe that this Bill matters a lot for  the youths and hence I support this Bill. It has been clearly mentioned in the  Constitution to promote brotherhood, to give respect to each citizen and provide  equal rights to everyone.   But Congress and two families from Jammu and  Kashmir kept playing games with the people there for their vested interests.  Had  Nehruji not ordered ceasefire then even Lahore would have been a part of India  today.  Shri Shyama Prasad Mukherji was murdered in Kashmir in 1953 when he  had gone there to oppose the permit and particularly Article 370.  Congress did not  even order an enquiry into his murder.  I support this Bill. Today, we all can celebrate Holi and Diwali  today itself.  Today it is the day of culmination of all the hard work that was being  done by our party for the last 70 years, the purpose for which agitations were being  held continuously, the purpose for which our first President Shyama Prasad  Mukherji gave away his life.  For this, I would like to congratulate hon. Prime  Minister, hon. Home Minister in particular on behalf of all the workers and all the  people that they brought such a Bill and that this Bill is being passed before us.    The mistake made by the Congress party, the mistake made by Nehruji due to  which we suffered so much, that mistake has been corrected today. I rise to support, on behalf of Shiv  Sena, the Amendment Bill brought to remove Article 370 and make Jammu and  Kashmir a Union Territory.  I pay respects to the jawans who laid down their lives  for the protection of Jammu and Kashmir since independence.  Today, every  Indian from Kashmir to Kanyakumari  is feeling overjoyed.  Kashmir is paradise of  India.  But unfortunately the Congress Government has, in the last 72 years, tried  to destroy this paradise.  Today, the people of Kashmir have achieved freedom in  the true sense for which they had been waiting.  Something should also be done for  the Kashmiri Pandits who got displaced due to Article 370. This Bill will pave the way for bringing self- respect and dignity to a marginalized society.  This Bill substantiates that we have  not been treating transgender as per what the Constitution mandates us to do.  So, it  is a laudable move.  I had gone through the Bill and did not find a provision  treating transgender as OBCs as per an earlier judgement of  the Supreme Court.   So, I request the hon. Minister to please consider this.  With these observations,  hoping that my suggestions will be taken into consideration, I support the Bill. I rise to support the historic Bill.  This  Bill established a law for lakhs of transgender persons who have been deprived of  their rights.  To bring the marginalized communities to the centre is a core  objective of this Bill.  It is shameful that access to basic facilities and basic  services is not given to them.  This is the more failure.  The State Governments and  the Central Government will prepare their own Health Manual.  I would like to say  that it is this Government which has stood by the marginalized whether it is was  the Muslim women, whether it was the SCs, STs and now, the transgenders who  have always been respected in Indian society. I would like to thank the Prime Minister of the   country and the Minister of Social Welfare and Empowerment for bringing in this  Bill for the protection of the rights of the transgender persons and for their welfare.   This Bill has been amended as per the recommendations made by the  Parliamentary Standing Committee.  The transgender persons are viewed with a   discriminatory approach in our society.  Hence, all the possible efforts are required  to be made to bring them into the mainstream of the society.  I support this Bill  which is intended to provide opportunities of education, employment and  healthcare facilities to the transgender persons. Even today the transgender persons  are subject to social boycott and discrimination in our society.  They have to face a  number of difficulties in the pursuit of earning their livelihood.  Not only that, they  are compelled to take recourse to begging.  This Bill provides for adequate  measures for the recognition of the identity of the transgender persons, equal  opportunity of education and employment, social security and healthcare facilities  along with eliminating the discrimination being meted out to them.  At the same  time, such a mechanism is required to be set up that may facilitate the persons of  this community to avail of the pension benefits.  With these words, I support this  Bill. Transgender community in the  country is a community which is most marginal because they do not fit under the  general categories of male or female.  As a result thereof, they have had been  facing problems like social boycott, discrimination, lack of educational facilities,  unemployment, lack of medical facilities etc.  Today, the Government has tried to  bring equality to them.  In clause 6 of this Bill, a provision has been made for the  education, social security and health of the transgenders separately.  The  Government has been taking not only one but many welfare measures for them.   There is a provision for constituting a national council for the transgenders.  A  facility of pension could have been provided to them on the lines of handicapped  persons.  This Bill will remove the pain or harassment faced by the families,  especially the parents on the birth of transgender children.  This Bill will provide to  the transgenders not only the Right to Equality in the society but also remove the  feeling of being a separate category from their mind.  Today is an historic day, I  support this Bill. Only we have discriminated against the people  of transgender community in the society.  The society has not tried to understand  their feelings.  They  also  have the right to live in the society but they have to get  separated from their family itself.  Due to lack of understanding, the parents  abandon their transgender children.  Now, after the passing of this Bill, the parents  will not behave with their transgender children in this manner because now they  will not be required to give answer to the questions raised by the society.  It is a  very important Bill and our Government deserves accolades for that because this  Bill has been brought to reform the society.    I applaud the Government for their effort to  regulate the practice of surrogacy.  I request the Minister to reconsider the  provision which lays down the waiting time of five years.  The Bill should define  'close relative' term clearly.  I also request the Minister to ensure anonymity of the  surrogate.  There should not be any overlap of authority between the national and  state level boards.  The Bill must provide a review and appeal procedure for  surrogacy applications which would give couples the right to challenge the  decision of the Boards.  There should be single uniform agenda to guide doctors or  patients.  The Government should invite successful surrogacy specialists on board  and consult with them to give a decent plan for the aspiring parents. I would like to congratulate the hon'ble  Minister for this Bill. It will streamline the practice of surrogacy in our country.  The hon'ble Minister has made a lot of provisions for ethical surrogacy in the Bill  like the setting up of National and State Boards. Board will be set up at national  and state level. These Boards will advise people regarding the Central Government  policy matters relating to surrogacy.  The National Surrogacy Board will also  supervise the state bodies.  There is a regulation in the Bill that only \\u201cclose  relatives\\u201d can be surrogate mother and no one else could be. It has some problem  as the speaker prior to me has said \\u2013 \\u2018closeness\\u2019 is not defined here. Suppose some  spouse live in orphanage who does not have any close relatives and if some  infertility case comes before them, where will they approach and who will become  their close relative in such a situation? I would like the Minister to ponder over  this. The provisions of penalty in the Bill are very good. If you want to implement  the penalty in a proper way and if you want to regulate it, some kind of inspection  mechanism should be there. The inspection mechanism should be better to  implement rules and regulations in a proper manner and see their effect, otherwise  problem will occur. This Bill aims to regulate the  surrogacy services in the country. This Bill prohibits the sale and purchase of  human embryos and gametes.  This Bill prevents commercialization of surrogacy  and prohibits potential exploitation of surrogate mothers.  This Bill aims to protect  the rights of children born through surrogacy.  Infertility is growing in India.  Surrogacy is helpful in such cases. Surrogacy has become powerful way of saving  marriages of childless couples.  It is mentioned in the Bill that a surrogate mother  should be a close relative. I would like to know from the hon'ble Minister as to  what is the definition of a close relative.  Our Government is sensitive towards  women, their safety, their health and dignity. I support this Bill. I support the Bill introduced by hon'ble  Minister of Health.  Along with this, I want to see in practice that it is implemented  in a transparent, disciplined way and with a far-reaching approach in the context of  practice and process of surrogacy. But with this facility we\\u2019ll have to ensure that it  is accepted easily in our society and this acceptability will be there only when the  surrogate mother belongs to that very family. Woman should not be treated as  machine of reproduction. There should be special provision in this regard. As it is  being practiced in hospitals, clinics, we should be very much concerned about the  health of would be mothers. There should be thorough investigation of the couple  before State or Central Board and permission should be given only if they are  found unfit for reproduction. Second, we have to strictly keep an eye on such  women who are engaged in commercial surrogacy. This treatment is costly, the  poor cannot adopt it.  There should be some provision in this Act for our those  poor sisters who remain in distress due to their infertility.  I thank you while  supporting this Bill from the core of my heart. I support Supreme Court (Number of Judges)  Amendment Bill, 2019.  There has been remarkable change in the judicial system  during the tenure of the hon. Law Minister.  I would like to request the hon. Law  Minister that the language used in the courts in various States should be respective  official language of that State.  It would bring about great change in the judicial  system. Litigation is becoming costly and cost of litigation in the Supreme Court is  even more.  The Government should study it and try to address this issue.  I would  like to appreciate the Supreme Court that cases are disposed of expeditiously there.   A number of hon. Members have put forth their views regarding National Judicial  Appointments Commission.  Our Government has taken concrete steps to improve  the judicial system.  We are moving ahead towards a new India.  Our Law Minister  should try to take steps to ensure disposal of all the pending cases in the country by  the year 2022.  Those who remember their  history, progress.  Today, we are discussing the incident of Jallianwala Bagh and I  would like to inform the House that the facts should be recorded in the history.   Grandfather of a leader of this Party in Punjab  had sent a telegram to General  Dyer approving his action at Jallianwala Bagh.  This is recorded history.  I would,  once again, like to say that this Bill is a perfect Bill.  How the leader of a Party  which approved of the action at Jallianwala Bagh and attacked the Akal Takht  Saheb, be kept on the Trust of Jallianwala Bagh. I rise to support the  Jallianwala  Bagh National Memorial (Amendment) Bill on behalf of my Party Shiv Sena.  As I  know Jallianwala Bagh is the memorial of cruelty of Britishers and symbol of  patriotism as well.  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre took place in the year 1919 and  now it has completed hundred years.  There was a movement of Salt Satyagrah in  the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi.  Britishers had imposed tax on salt and during  that time Mahatma Gandhi crossed from Shiroda village which lies in my  Parliamentary Constituency Sindhudurg.  Whenever freedom struggle was fought  in the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, all those places must be turned into a  memorial to preserve the history.    Jallianwala Bagh massacre was  not an ordinary incident.  The seeds of this incident were sown immediately after  the revolt of 1857.  Thereafter, when Gandhiji returned to India from Africa, he  raised his voice against the Rowlatt Act and he also carried out Satyagrah against  it.  Wide-spread protests were launched against the Rowlatt Act in each and every  city of Punjab.  General Dyre resorted to extreme brutalities to suppress the  movement. His statement before the enquiry committee is a testimony of his sheer  brutality.  A child named Udham Singh was the witness of that massacre who later  took a vow to resort to unfailing retaliatory move. More than 350 people were  martyred and 1500 people were injured in the Jallianwala Bagh incident.  So, I  support this Bill which seeks to amend the Sections of this Bill. I rise to support the Jallianwala Bagh  National Memorial (Amendment) Bill, 2019.  It is essential to remember Sardar  Udham Singh ji on this occasion.  So, first of all, I would pay my homage to him  and to the martyrs of Jallianwala Bagh incident.  Through this Bill, we are not  taking such step which may cause any injustice to the people of this country. Our  Government has built many such memorials of several eminent persons but our  Government has never made a claim that member of such memorial trust would be  from our party.  We used to listen stories of the gory incident of Jallianwala Bagh  during our childhood days and I feel that Jallianwala incident was the only incident  which had shaken the whole nation. National memorial should be built on every  place which is related to the freedom struggle of our country.  There is also a need  to build a national memorial at Chhawani Shahid in my district.  The Government  has been definitely striving for running these institutions in an impartial manner.  I  feel that if these institutions are represented by the Government and the people  having history background, the functioning of such institutions could be  streamlined. This Parliament has been a witness to a large  number of debates on historical issues.  I would like to thank the Government of  India for inspiring the Parliament of the country to discuss the matters of historical  importance.  The national movement should not be dragged into the political  debate.  I would like to submit that the efforts should also be made to ensure that  the debate which is going on the historical issues does not turn into a farce.   History has so much vigour that no one can dare to change it.  I agree to the fact  that all the memorials of this country should be maintained by the Ministry of  Culture. The Dam Safety Bill has been presented in  Lok Sabha to ensure safety, proper monitoring, inspection and operation of dams  in the country and I appreciate such move.  The duties and functions of all the  committees proposed in the Bill have been defined. Through this Bill, water can be  supplied to water scarcity areas from those areas having excess of water so as to  address the problem of farmers. I have witnessed the flood situation in my  parliamentary constituency, Sheohar, Sitamarhi, Motihari districts of Bihar where  people have suffered loss of life and property which is quite painful.  There is a  need to construct dams for storage of water. The Government should hold positive  dialogue with the Government of Nepal so as to find a solution of the problem at  the earliest.  There is a provision to provide fund for relief measures under the  National Disaster Response Fund, but I urge that compensation for loss caused by  flood should be provided through the said fund.  The main concern related to large  dams is that these dams are not maintained properly.  Lakhs of people are living  around large and small dams across the country including my parliamentary  constituency, Sheohar.  It is matter of concern that about 75 per cent of the large  dams are more than 25 years old and about 150 dams are more than 100 years old.   I support this Dam Safety Bill presented by the Government in public interest from  the bottom of my heart. The first time the idea of bringing about a Bill  of this nature to protect the dams of this country originated in the year 1982. This  particular attempt, I am sure, will bear fruit because this particular Bill is brought  about under Article 246 of the Constitution of India read with Entry 56 and 91 of  List 1.  It is being argued by the Opposition that the Union Government does not  have the legislative competence to legislate on matters.  The Union Government  derives the legislative competence to legislate on all matters under Article 246 of  the Constitution of India.  The legislation is primarily to look after maintenance,  surveillance and safety of the dams and has nothing absolutely whatsoever in  controlling the ownership, controlling of water or any other such ancillary subjects  which the Opposition may have any fears over.  Two specific issues are attributed  to make this legislation imperative.  As per the CAG Report of 2017, only two  States, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, out of the 17States conducted a pre-monsoon  and post-monsoon audit on the safety of their dams.  As per the World Bank report  of 2002 most of the dam safety regulations are made at the federal level in the most  of the countries.  There are penal provisions in this Bill, which will enforce the  guidelines of the National Dam Safety Authority as well as the State Dam Safety  Organizations.  This Bill will be a more comprehensive legislation if consequent  penal provisions are also incorporated in this Bill to fix the accountability of errant  officials or errant owners of the dams. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code has been  successful in achieving its targets.  With the help of this Code, banks have been  able to increase the rate of recovery from 23 to 43 per cent from the insolvent  industries.  India's ranking has also seen improvement in the matter of insolvency.   This amendment Bill will help the authorities to take speedy decisions.   In terms  of insolvency, India ranked 134 which has since galloped to the 26th position.  Not  just that, even in terms of ease of doing business we have been able to move up  from 133rd position to 77th.   In the year, 2018 our country has been conferred  upon Global Restructuring Review award.  Coming to the Bill, earlier, it took four  years and three months the resolve cases of insolvency which has now been  reduced to 324 days.  As per the statistics available, out of the subjudice cases  under the I.B.C. as few as 32 per cent cases are older than 270 days.  It merits  attention here that earlier, there was binding of 270 days, yet a good number of  matters used to get stuck in court cases.  Seeing that, the timeline for the disposal  of all the disputes has since been extended to 330 days.  It is a very good step.  As  per the provisions of the Bill, NCLAT and DRT will have to accept or reject the  cases within 15 days.  At the top of it, if at all, there is a delay, reasons for the  same will have to recorded in writing.  It is a good move.  Further, Committee of  Creditors has been equipped with more rights.  There would be a single window  system to take care of the whole host of issues like restructuring, merger,  demerger, amalgamation etc.  The Government is supposed to formulate policies  and to provide conducive environment to the entrepreneurs enabling them to carry  out their function properly. Ours is the fastest growing economy in  the world.  Increase in NPAs of banks adversely affects development.  The  Government has brought this law to deal with this problem.  Hopefully this will  yield good results.  94 cases have been resolved under the Corporate Insolvency  Resolution Process till 31st March, 2019.  This is good that insolvency resolution  ranking of India for 2014 has improved from 134 to 108. I support the Bill. I slightly  disagree on suggestion of arbitration by a High Court Judge as they are already  overworked and the term 'eminent person' is so vague. 'Eminent person' is a very  relative term. I think there should be no ambiguity ever and no misuse of it.  The  qualification, experience and norms of accreditation of arbitrators shall be such as  specified in the Eighth Schedule. Provided the Eighth Schedule shall be deemed to  have been amended accordingly and Parliament really shall have no role once you  change it. Minister should clarify it for record. There are 3,28,000 cases pending in  arbitration. This could reduce litigation to a large extent. If you do want to do this  for ease of business, I think in a country like us we need it. In past we have lost  foreign investment due to litigations. I think this is a great intervention. The Arbitration Act, 1996 was amended by the  Act of 2015 to make the arbitration process smooth.  Therefore, the Government in  order to identify the road blocks in the development of arbitration institutions,  under the Bill of 2009 makes provision for Arbitration Council.  By making the  council \\u2019body corporate\\u2019 it raises certain queries about its nature.  Under it,  international persons will also become arbitrators.  Subject to the fact that there  should be no conflict of interest, parties could decide whoever they want as  arbitrators .  There certainly is a need to institutionalize the entire arbitration set up  in India.  Therefore, I support the Bill in its entirety. Government has been duly appreciated and duly  thanked for various landmark reforms.  The Government is working towards  establishing a settled law when it comes to the bankruptcy process.  The  governance is achieved when the rules are clear.   It is the job of the Government  to make the rules clear for the various players in the industry, in the economy, so  that everybody can conduct themselves accordingly. The Insolvency and  Bankruptcy Code has already been very successful. We have already seen 101  cases that have been withdrawn, 120 cases that have been resolved and 475 cases  that have been taken into liquidation.  So, the Code is working very well.  It will  enable us to meet our philosophy of \\u2018minimum government, maximum  governance\\u2019.  A very important aspect of this Bill is introducing many other  possibilities that were not allowed earlier such as mergers, amalgamations and de- mergers.  That will make this Bill work much more efficiently and take our  economy to 10 trillion. The names of legislations have changed,  decades have gone by and the entire Government machinery has been put to stop  this menace of NPAs, but not been able to contain this issue of rising NPAs.  You  have genuine business failure on the one hand and willful defaulters and malicious  failures on the other hand.  We need to differentiate these two.  In this whole  process, banks and lenders also have a very important role to play.  I believe that  the accountability with the banks needs to be much higher.  They have to do their  own survey and look at the state of the economy.  If banks are giving loans without  evaluating all of these factors, the NPAs will continue to go up.  If we do not  distinguish between genuine business failure and willful default, we will lose our  ability to innovate as a country and ultimately it will affect our growth.  I suggest  for consideration of the hon. Minister to provide one last opportunity to the debtor,  because our ultimate objective is to turn the business around and keep it running  and not to close the business.  Kindly look at this.  With these observations, I  support this Bill. I have risen here to support this  Bill.  The proposed amendments about porn are necessary.  Now, all children keep  mobile phones in their hands. The mobile phones have got numerous benefits but  they are equally harmful also.  Therefore, it was necessary to bring a stringent law  on pornography and it was also required to define it.  Last week, the Hon. Supreme  Court said that special Courts should be set up in each district for the disposal of  POCSO cases.  Last year, as many as 33,000 cases were registered in the country.   The Government is trying to purge the culture of the country through this Bill. I rise to support the Bill. Hon. Minister  deserves all laurels for bringing a comprehensive amendment to the Act.  One of  the new developments in this area is cyber world offences.  It is heartening to  know that \\u2018child pornography\\u2019 has been given a comprehensive definition, and it is  expected to take care of new challenges that we confront.  One aspect of the matter  deserves some kind of consideration. We have shifted this from \\u201ccommunal or  sectarian violence\\u201d to \\u201cviolence or during any natural calamity\\u201d.  Who will decide  this \\u201c\\u2026.. in similar situations\\u201d?  What is the \\u2018situation\\u2019? We leave too much to the  Trial Judge. This again needs to be considered.  These offences are mostly  committed in the child care institutions. The hon. Minister has to come out with a  comprehensive policy to shift attention from institutional care to non-institutional  care or alternative care so that less and less children are sent to these institutions.   You cannot divorce it from the POCSO Act and the Juvenile Justice Act because  these are parts of the same thing. We have to evolve a holistic approach.  My  request to the hon. Minister is that we should strengthen the preventive  mechanism.  I want some kind of death sentence of a very, very aggravated form  so that the life of the child is saved.  I would like to thank the Hon. Minister for  bringing this Bill on such a sensitive issue in the Parliament.  Several discussions  are taking place on Section 6 of the Principal Act in which there is an amendment  of death penalty and I wonder, why death penalty should not be there. In this  regard, the government deserves to be congratulated for showing so much of will  power to bring the provision of death penalty in the Act. I have a suggestion that  provisions should also be made in the Act against the persons committing  organized crime against the children. Unless the mindset of the society undergoes a  change, no law will become more successful. However, there is a need to bring  awareness and launch a campaign in the society that the children have to become a  good citizen in this country. We will be able to do something when their mindset is  healthy. Therefore, I would urge the Parliament to pass it. I will have a small  suggestion for the amendment. Section-1 and 2 of the Principal Act-3 in case of  amendment of Section-4, should be substituted because in my opinion you will  have to change it if not today then tomorrow. If it is amended it would be better  because if this problem is resolved as to how much money should be given to the  victim, the introduction of this Bill will become meaningful. First of all, I would like to  congratulate hon'ble Prime Minister and Minister of Women and Child  Development for introducing such sensitive matter with consensus.  All of us say  that there is a need to change the mindset of society, but it is necessary that we  should start this change with ourselves. When such issues are debated then all of us  want women to talk. Should it necessarily be a matter related to women?  I think  men should also raise such issues. Unless we change our mindset we cannot put  any good example in society. Rehabilitation of victim should certainly be  considered.  May we take certain initiative so that NGOs or Volunteers help  children to bring back their mental balance?  There should certainly be provision  for this purpose.  POCSO needs to be  implemented swiftly and also keeping in mind the sensitivity and care of survivors.   I have a few suggestions to the hon. Minister through you that a Child psychiatrist's  presence has to be made mandatory during each investigation to aid and advice  especially in cases of female victims, the questioning should be done under female  supervision.  Offenders are punished once but the victims are punished repeatedly  during the course of interrogation.  I support this Bill whole-heartedly. The demand for such a Bill was being  made for long time in the country.  First Nithari incident took place and thereafter  followed the Nirbhaya incident.  Sexual predators do not consider the age of  children and sexual crime against children of one to three years are also  committed.  I would like to congratulate the hon. Minister for introducing charges   in POCSO Act of 2012 and making provision of capital punishment therein.  This  Bill is certainly an important step to check the increasing incidents of sexual crime  against children.  I would like to congratulate the hon. Minister for setting up 1023  special fast track courts.  But safety of witnesses should also be taken care of. I support this Bill.  Today punishment of death penalty has been pronounced within 8 months of a rape  and murder case of 3 years 7 months old girl child under the POCSO Act.  This is  perhaps the first instance after the Act was enacted in the year 2012.  I welcome  the provision of 10 years of imprisonment to curb the menace of child pornography  and misuse of children for it, which was only seven years earlier.  I also welcome  the provision of 20 years of imprisonment for committing the crime of penetrative  sex against children below the age of 16 years.  The payment of compensation  should be made as soon as possible so that the children can get treatment.   Provision of psychological counselling should also be made.   I support the POCSO (Amendment) Bill.   This Bill increases the punishment for offenders which is justified.  I request the  Hon. Minister that nothing less than the death penalty should be awarded in case of  any sexual assault or unnatural act on a child less than the age  of 15 years.   This  Bill has also increased the punishment for using children for pornography.  Possessing any material related to child pornography should also be brought under  the category of offence.  A  law in this regard should be framed in our country also  as many other countries have a provision of 10 years imprisonment for possessing  such material. I rise to support Arbitration and Conciliation  (Amendment) Bill, 2019. The objective of this Bill is to provide fair and  transparent judicial system for the civil and commercial disputes outside the  Courts. India is a big market and the difficulties related to trade have decreased.  The economy of the country is consistently growing at rapid speed, therefore it has  become the centre of attraction. In view of the above there is a need of Modern  Dispute Redressal Law. 95 per cent of commercial disputes are being settled  through arbitration in the developed countries in the entire world. The Law  Minister with his utmost dedication made efforts to dispose of the cases of civil  and commercial nature and to make India an arbitration hub in the world in the  field of disposing of international trade disputes. The real objective of this Bill is  the appointment of arbitrators and the establishment of Indian Arbitration Council.  Recently, one hon. Member had discussed about the pending cases in the Courts in  India, therefore in present scenario these laws are needed. She had mentioned  about more than three crore cases. Out of these three crore cases 46 per cent cases  are such wherein Government Departments and Government Corporations are up  against each other. If we successfully settle those cases, the figure of three crore  would come down to one and a half crore. This Act would definitely enable the  creation of such structure of arbitration, which will reduce the dependency on court  and decrease the differences as well and will create a trade and development  friendly environment. Due to these effects this Act would prove a mile stone,  which would settle the domestic as well as international disputes as a result of  which India would become an international centre. Disputes relating to sharing of river water have  been going on in the country since the last 60-70 years.  The Article 262 clearly  states that the Parliament may by law provide for the adjudication of any dispute or  complaint with respect to the use, distribution or control of the waters of, or in, any  inter-State river or river valley.  Therefore, there shouldn't be any doubt that the  Government of India has no power to enact law on this subject.  There are about 20  big state basins of rivers in the country.  Our experience has been that the tribunals  have neither passed any award for many years nor any time limit relating to them  has been prescribed.  Earlier, all the tribunals had judicial members.  This time, the  Bill proposes that it will have judicial members as well as expert members also,  who will be of the level of chief engineer with experience of working on river  water disputes.  This is happening for the first time.  It is the need of the hour that  we constitute a permanent Tribunal so that the ever increasing number of inter- state river water disputes could be checked.  Further, I would like to ask the hon.  Minister whether the Government will review the Indus Water Treaty signed  between India and Pakistan in 1960 so that our country gets justice. This public property eviction law  was made in 1971 and it was brought again in 2017.  Today, it has been brought  again here and for that, I would like to thank honourable Minister.  Government  assets are for the execution of social obligations.  Through the amended law, it will  be possible for the new allottees to receive the government facility quickly. There  are many types of government assets in the country.  But, it is seen that people  illegally possess these assets for many years and it makes significant loss to the  revenue of the Government. My Parliamentary Constituency is Palghar.  The  population of that area has increased upto around 20 lakh. The city, Vasai-Virar  near Mumbai is also known as third Mumbai city. Illegal works are being done in  many places which are under Government control. We have to protect the  Government land.  So, I support this Bill. The unauthorized occupants in  the government accommodations are required to be evicted as per the provisions of  PPE Act, 1971.  This process generally takes very long time.  So, there was urgent  need for such an Act.  Hence, due to absence of any such Act, people stayed in the  government accommodations in unauthorized capacity and used to go to court in  case of getting notice from Estate officer.  These cases take very long time and  people continue their unauthorized stay in government accommodations.  There are  a number of merits in this Bill.  Unauthorized stay of people in government  accommodations also results in loss of revenue for the government.  The  government has to pay allowance to those who have not been allotted government  accommodations.  There are also cases of misuse of government accommodation  in Bihar.  But the present government has taken back these accommodations and  has used it for opening schools for the dalits and underprivileged people. I  rise to  support this Bill. Now, the  markets have become advanced as a result of which certain evils have also crept in  along with many good things.  Sometimes, the consumers are cheated.  This Bill  provides for a Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA). Earlier, district  forums were entitled to try the disputes of value of upto Rs. 20 lakh. Now, this  limit has been enhanced to Rs. 1 crore.  This Bill has a provision of mediation also.   The sellers should mandatorily give a bill for the sale and the goods can be  returned within a period of 1 month.  All the market committees and government  godowns should be equipped with electronic weighing machines for the benefit of  farmers. I rise to support this Bill. This Bill  has a new provision of class action suit. There is a provision of mediation also in  the Bill. E-commerce policy and Consumer Protection Bill are in conflict with each  other. I would like to know as to what will be the qualification of the judges.  Earlier, the forums at district level were entitled to try the disputes of value upto  Rs. 20 lakh.  It's good that now this limit has been enhanced to Rs. 1 crore. I rise to support the Consumer Protection Bill,  2019.  The object of this Bill is to protect the interests of the consumers.  The  entitlement of different consumer forums has been enhanced.  Besides, provision  of mediation as well as facility of registering online complaints is also there.  Now  many people are  using e-commerce.  This is also a big challenge before us.  This  Bill proposes to establish a Central Consumer Authority which will help us stop  unethical trade practices.  This Bill provides that in case a consumer gets a  favourable verdict from a district forum or the State Commission, the opponent  company does not have a choice to move the National Commission.  This Bill  provides the facility of hearing through video conferencing as well.  The  Government should address the issue of MRP also. I would definitely like to say that  this particular Bill if implemented well, will be a game-changer for consumers and  consumers interests in our country.  There are three major goals of this Bill. One is  to prevent violation of consumer rights, two is to check illegal trade practice, to  check illegal business ethics and the last one is to prevent misleading  advertisements.  We have been talking about different kinds of marketing,  misleading advertisements, tele-marketing, multi-level marketing, direct selling  and e-commerce pose new challenges to the consumers.  So, there is the need for  this kind of a Bill.  About 4,61,000 cases await disposal.  This is extremely  unfortunate.  So, we need quick disposal of cases. The Bill provides for several  provisions for simplifying the consumer dispute adjudication process.  This Bill is  very much pro-consumer.  We are talking of ease in filing.  The e-filing is there.   The mediation and product liability is there.  We all need to work together. This  comprehensive Bill is very much in the interest of consumers. On my own behalf and of my  Party, I sincerely thank the Government especially the Minister of Labour, Santosh  Gangwar for the Labour codes, 2019. You have taken a very big bold step. None of  the political party in power showed courage to change an old law which was  already in use before the independence. But, this Government has changed this old  law from the time of independence. This law used to comprise of 44 laws in the  code of conduct for Labour. Now, these laws will be merged into 4 codes. By  constituting the Advisory Board, the Government has fixed the wage of labourers  which is a good step for the welfare of the labourers. The best part of this Act is  that it has the provision to increase the employment opportunities for women and  the safety of women. There are about 40 to 42 crores of labourers in the  unorganized sector of the country.  To protect the interest of the labourers in  unorganized sector is a big challenge for the Government and all of us. You have  brought this effective law which will definitely benefit the labourers in  unorganized sector. Women also work in unorganized sector. There is a need to  make a provision for their safety. If someone violates the formula brought by you,  there should be strict provision for that. If the provision is weak then the employers  will escape by giving low wages. Therefore, strict action should be taken and there  should be a provision for punishment in that.  If there are less than 10 number of  employed labourers in an institution, the provision for them is not given in this  code. Small companies will try to employ seven to eight labourers and the rest as  contract labourers. You should take note of it. Finally, I would say that me and my  Party support the Labour Code, 2019 brought by you. The mechanism for fixing minimum  wages for workers is very complex in the country.  Even the workers are not aware  about the exact minimum wages fixed for them.  There is provision in the Bill to  restrict the kind component of wages maximum upto 15 per cent for workers  engaged in the plantation sector.  This is a historic step.  A number of minute  changes have been made in the new Code on Wages.  The issue of gender  discrimination has been addressed in this code.  Earlier, the workers had to  approach multiple authorities in case of non-payment of minimum wages.   Provision of single window mechanism has been introduced in this code on wages.   Provision for appellate authority has also been made in it.  The existing mechanism  for inspection is also very bad.  Provision for web based inspection has been made  therein.  I hope that through this Code on Wages workers will be benefitted and  there will be change in their lives. I congratulate the Hon. Minister for bringing this  Bill.  The Code on Wages Bill would abolish  the exploitative  labour laws of  British era and will lay foundation for a new India.  This Bill would be helpful in  ensuring ease of doing business and will give momentum to  Make in India  Programme also.   The most important point is that this Bill ensures minimum  wages to the workers employed in organized and unorganized sectors across the  country.   This Bill will increase the legislative protection of minimum wages from  existing 40% to 100% work force. A simplified wage code has been prepared by  subsuming the existing four Acts - the Payment of wages Act, the Minimum  Wages Act, the Payment of Bonus Act and the Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 into  this one.  I would like to mention about my Parliamentary Constituency that tea  gardens in this area are facing lot of problems. Tea gardens are on the verge of  closure and the condition of the workers employed in these gardens is very pathetic  though Minimum Wage Act is implemented here.  There is  a need to change  the  PLA Act, 1951 also. The Code on Wages Bill is a historical bill which would  ensure minimum wages and  timely payment of wages  to 50 crore labourers across  the country and will also ensure ease of living while promoting ease of doing  business.  This Bill would help in abolishing gender discrimination in the country.      *SHRI THOL THIRUMAAVALAVAN: This Code is aimed at  amalgamating four old labour laws into one.  Although I welcome this Code being  brought with a good intention and aim keeping in view the interests of the  labourers and to fix the minimum wage on the basis of a law, I wish to register my  concern that this is a move aimed to help the corporate and international                                                              * Original in Tamil  companies.  The Government has fixed the time period for revision of minimum  wages once in five years.  But this Bill remains silent about revision of floor wage  and the period of such a revision.  As this Bill is affecting the interests of the  labourers and workers of the country.  I request to send this Bill for the review  and  consideration of the Standing Committee. This is a very important Bill.  It aims at  bringing about massive improvement in the medical sector.  Shortage of qualified  doctors is an issue of grave concern.  It seems pertinent to mention in this context  that a good number of specialists are being appointed in each Sadar hospital at the  district level.  Thanks to the initiatives undertaken by the Government of Bihar in  order that all sorts of medical facilities may be available in the rural areas itself.   With the passing of the National Medical Commission Bill, I am sure there would  be qualitative changes in the field of medical education in terms of transparency,  accountability and of course in the monitoring of medical education in the country.   A host of initiatives have been made by the Government to increase the number of  seats in various medical educational institution/medical colleges.  The conduct of  final MBBS exams of all the medical colleges simultaneously and the provision  of  NEXT is a laudable step.  This will facilitate the students and they will not be  required to take the PG Admission Test separately.  Due to unavailability of any  direct train from my Parliamentary Constituency Gopalganj people are compelled  to journey by train to the metropolitan cities in pursuit of their treatment.  If a  medical college is set up at Gopalganj district in North Bihar, this will go a long  way in providing proper healthcare facility to those living in the rural areas of the  district.  Finally, I support the Bill.   This Bill is a very important Bill  because it is going to replace the Medical Council of India and a new National  Commission is being set up to improve the medical education in our country.  The  Bill also proposes to create four autonomous boards, which is a clear demarcation  of functions to regulate various aspect of medical education.  This would bring in  more transparency in selection process of Chairperson, Secretary and part time  members.  I would request the hon. Minister to clarify about the entrance exam to  what criterion will be there.  I would request the Minister that the practical exam  should not be taken in the same institute where the student is studying.  There  should be a completely transparent process so that there does not exist any chance  of bias. The amendments  proposed to the Company Law seek to tighten corporate social responsibility  compliance and reduce the load of cases on National Company Law Tribunal.  The  proposed legislation is intended to address the difficulties faced by stakeholders  and ease of doing business in order to promote growth and employment.  In the  interest of transparency and fairness, guiding principles for determination of  penalties have been introduced, which would help the companies to a large extent.   It is hoped that the change in the provisions of the Act will bring about a change in  the way the corporate world works.  Apart from that, under the amended law, non- maintenance of registered office and non-reporting of commencement of business  would be the grounds for striking off the name of a company from a register.  The  amendments are aimed at filling critical gaps in the Corporate Governance and  Compliance Framework as well as simultaneously extended great ease of doing  business to law-abiding corporates. Elections in our country commenced in the  year 1952.  We have been observing elections since the election to the first Lok  Sabha in the country that voting percentage has been very low.  For the first time,  in the recent elections, the voting percentage has gone upto 65 to 70 per cent which  has never been the case in the last many years.  This became possible because of  good election management by the Election Commission.  In my parliamentary  constituency of Jhalawar-Baran, we could reach upto  72 per cent voting for the  first time.  But here I need to say that if we make voting compulsory it would be an  infringement on our democratic rights. (Speech unfinished)  The discussion was not concluded.        SNEHLATA History is being created today  which would figure in golden letters in the annals of our Parliament. Hon. Supreme  Court has directed the Parliament in this matter twice in the past. Firstly, in Shah  Bano case and now in Shayara Bano case.  This is the difference of two  Governments.  This Government is competent enough to enact a law against the  triple talaq to give freedom to our sisters in the country after 72 years of  Independence.  A sincere effort is being made to give justice to all Muslim sisters  with a sense of duty, equity and equality.  Therefore, the Government deserves our  kudos.  Such a longstanding social evil needs to be removed through enactment of  law and not through society.  This was mandated by hon. Supreme Court and this  must be the duty of the politicians. The Government has decided to support  the Supreme Court Judgment through this Bill and this is an admirable cause. The  hon. Law Minister has pointed out that more than 200 cases have come even after  the Supreme Court\\u2019s Judgment which is really alarming.  It seeks to deter Muslim  husbands from whimsically divorcing their wives.  If passed, the Bill shall provide  equality to women that the Constitution of India mandates and the hon. Supreme  Court recommends. Marriage is a civil contract. We feel that divorce-related  offences under it should not be criminalized unless they can be linked to domestic  violence.  The Act of triple Talaq will result in imprisonment upto three years for  the husband, there is no clear provision as to how the incarcerated person will  provide maintenance to the wife.  The Bill should include a provision giving  women the option to ratify a marriage annulment and claim the maintenance under  this Bill.  Society today is moving towards decriminalizing certain things and  improving inter-personal relationships.  Section 377 has been decriminalized.  So,  let  us think beyond party lines and political agendas.     Muslim women have so far had no say in  the talaq-e-biddat practice of divorce in Muslim personal law. This Bill seeks to  change that, and I extend full credit to this Government for taking heed of the  issue.  All the Muslim countries have imposed ban on the practice of instant triple  Talaq.  The Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan conducted a national survey in  2015 and found that 92.1 per cent of Muslim women backed a total ban on oral or  unilateral divorce. It is now time for India to take this step.  I also support the  Government\\u2018s effort to criminalize a void verbal statement because it sends a  message that a wife is not a disposable commodity.  We have to realize that this  practice is an easy bail out for all other evils too, such as dowry, domestic violence  or even infidelity.  This Bill is about women\\u2019s rights.  Do not make it about  religion.  I would exhort the Minister to launch nationwide campaign and spread  awareness about the practice of triple Talaq being null and void now for the  uneducated Muslim women. Marriage is a sacred institution.  By  entering into matrimonial alliance with a person, one is supposed to be with each  other through thick and thin.  The religion has to move forward in consonance with  the changing paradigm of society.  Social reforms have to be espoused to keep  progressing.  Prevention is always better than cure.  In a way, the provisions  contained in the Bill are of preventive nature.  So, we must support it.  This Bill  has been brought for the sake of upholding the esteem of women and gender  equality.  It is not that the incidents of triple talaq are witnessed only among the  illiterate gentry.  The fact remains that well educated women are also subjected to  this evil practice.  I am of the opinion that progress of women is a must for the  progress of the nation.  So, a law for equality is imperative.      I think all of us need to commend  the efforts of the Government and the hon. Prime Minister for having shown the  courage of come up with this king of Bill. This has been debated upon and the  suggestions that have been worthwhile have been incorporated. This Bill is a  logical culmination of the verdict given by the hon. Supreme Court in Shayara  Bano case on 22nd August, 2017. It very clearly held that talak-e-biddat violated  constitutional morality. It is definitely a non-bailable offence, but there is  conditional bail. Of course, there is the issue of allowance also. The Shah Bano  case would not have happened had this Act there at that point of time. Of course,  there is the issue of custody of children also. It is a great thing that the custody  issue has also brought in here. In this Parliament, there have been legislation  against dowry and sati, then what is the problem about this particular thing that we  are talking about. I would just like to make a remark. When men are oppressed, it  is a tragedy. But when women are oppressed, it is a tradition. This is not  acceptable. This is a historic moment for all  of us because this Bill will give Muslim women equality and a dignified life, which  is their well-deserved right. There are various laws as Section 3 of the Dowry  Prohibition Act, 1961, Section 498A of IPC and Section 17 of the Hindu Marriage  Act, 1956 which prescribe imprisonment of the Hindu men. You are crying for the  provision of imprisonment of the Muslim Men. It is a matter of oppression,  exploitation and injustice. It is a tool to deprive the crores of Muslim sisters of  their right to equality. The Muslim women need liberation not only from Triple  Talaq, but from crimes like polygamy and Halala also. The countries like Turkey,  Pakistan, Bangladesh, Syria, Iraq, Sudan and Libia have freed their women from  Triple Talaq. It is easy for anybody to just give up this issue, as has been done in  the past. Now, the Government led by Shri Narendra Modiji is committed to  discharge its duty. Five Muslim women including Ishrat Jahan are fighting against  the issue of Triple Talaq. Ishrat Jahan is from West Bengal. The Muslim men are  insulting Ishrat Jahan in West Bengal despite it is being ruled by a woman Chief  Minister.    We need to take stringent action  against the terrorists activities in the country.  This amendment Bill will strengthen  the National Investigation Agency which remains always vigilant for the security  of the country.  The previous Governments could not be so much successful in  containing the terrorism.  Those Governments brought a number of Acts like  MISA, TADA, MCOCA, POTA etc. but this Government has been successful in  its endeavour to curb terrorist activities.  It is the first time ever in the history of  this country that the Minister of Home Affairs was received with  open arms in  Jammu and Kashmir.  It is because people have faith in the Prime Minister and the  Minister of Home Affairs.  This amendment will help the authorities to confiscate  the property of a terrorist.  There were a number of channels through which  economic assistance was provided to the terrorists and there was an urgent need to  restrict the activities of such people.  There was a need to take legal action not only  against an organisation but also an individual.  This amendment Bill will help in  doing all these things.  My suggestion is that appropriate changes should be  brought about in the legal provisions to check the delay caused by the judicial  process. We must take all the necessary steps to  maintain the sovereignty and integrity of the country. Our Government believes in  the policy of zero tolerance. Stringent law must be there to arrest the culprits.  There is no ill will in this. The Bill has been brought only to simplify the  procedure. Amendments have been brought to strengthen the investigating  agencies. Terrorism is spreading its tentacles in all over the world. Today there are  so many countries in the world which are badly affected by terrorism.  This Bill is  in the interest of the country, therefore, I support this Bill. I rise to support this Bill.  We all should understand that this Bill is against the terrorists. Stringent laws  create fear in the minds of the criminals. Strict decisions of the Government have  resulted in mitigation of terrorist activities in the country. I support this Bill. It is a historic step to  stop corruption. As per CBI 68 thousand crore rupees have been collected from 6  crores of people in the country through illegal schemes. There are many provisions  to take action against such individuals but they escape because of loopholes in the  law. In this law, strict provision has been made.  Punishment and penalty has been  increased. In these schemes, mostly the poor people from villages fall into the trap.  Scams are done by bringing different schemes. The companies show such dreams  that the people fall into their trap. Through this Bill, illegal deposit schemes and  black money can be restricted to a large extent. The Government is constantly  working for the interests of the common people of the country. At the outset, I would like to thank the  Government for formulating a series of laws against terrorists, financial defaulters   and enemies of humanity.  I rise to support this Unlawful Activities (Prevention)  Amendment Bill.  Terrorism emanates from different sets of horrific ideology and  hence we need different laws to fight this menace.  Some of my colleagues raised a   question on the necessity of a stringent law.  For the reasons of the law being weak  in nature, such a milieu of fear and terror has engulfed this country that no one  feels safe today.  So, laws need to be framed commensurate with the gravity of  crime.  Those need to be proclaimed as terrorists who extend assistance, support  and finance to the terrorists.  Only by doing so we can stop the terrorists outfits  from spreading their tentacles.  This Bill provides for a definitive time frame for  the completion of the investigation of crimes related to terrorism.  The question is  whether we can bring in such a law that will ensure time bound trial even in court.   Terrorism being a national problem, it must be dealt with at the national  level. I rise to speak in favour of this Bill.  There are  hundreds of such examples in Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Maharashtra and  Karnataka where several families have been ruined.  The Reserve Bank of India  has said that it cannot regulate anybody apart from N.B.F.C. and banks. These  people always find out the escape route for every legislation. Security and  Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has submitted about Saradha Group in the year  2009 that it is a scam and it should be checked.  Thereafter SEBI has started  investigation into the matter and submitted its report to the Ministry of Corporate  Affairs in the year 2010 stating that it is a major scam and action should be taken  in this regard but nothing such happened.  The said Group had given motorcycles  to Kolkata Police under CSR.  If a Group has good relation with leaders and  bureaucrats then do you think that investigation into the matter will be conducted?   Similarly Rose Vally scam had also taken place in which an amount of Rs. 60,000  was involved. But I would like to state that the Government has presented the Bill  in view of all the above mentioned situations.  We have to consider the Bill rising  above our Party lines so that action should be taken against such scamsters and  these persons involved in it should be sent behind bars. I rise to support Motor Vehicles  (Amendment) Bill, 2019.  Motor Vehicles Act was enacted 30 years before and so  much changes have taken place during last 30 years.  Therefore, there was a need  to amend this Act.  Road connectivity, people's safety, timely treatment, insurance,  compensation, simplification of transport related procedures and other things have  been kept in mind in this Bill.  Amendments have been made in this Bill in the  matters related to passengers, freight, operation, driving license, insurance etc.  So  many new provisions have been made in this Bill about security.  Road accidents  take place due to wrongly issued driving licenses. There is a loss of 3 per cent of  GDP every year due to road accidents.  Therefore, there is a need to control these  accidents.    It is very unfortunate that 1.5 lakh people die in  around 5 lakh road accidents that takes place in the country every year.  Various  other problems also existed in the transport industry.  People have to face various  difficulties in getting licence at RTO.  Now, under the able leadership of hon.  Prime Minister, this Government has strived hard to overcome this difficult  situation and it seems that India is scaling new heights to become a modern nation  in the fields of roads and transport by implementing innovative ideas and projects.   With a great pride, I can say that now it is possible to cover the distance between  my parliamentary area Karauli and Dholpur in one and a half hour only whereas  earlier it used to take 5 hours to cover the same.  Through this Bill, this  Government has provided for online registration and driving licence as a step  towards building a nation free from corruption.  This will also modernise the  process involved in issuing driving licence and vehicle registration in India.  Apart  from that, provisions have also been made under this Bill  to link Aadhaar card  with driving licence and vehicle registrations.  This will also eliminate the problem  of fake licences.  It is a very important Bill associated with the lives of the people  of this country.  This also shows that our Government is committed under the able  leadership of hon. Prime Minister.  Under this Bill, provisions have been made that  if a minor is caught driving the vehicle and is involved in any accident or violation  of any rule then his parents or the vehicle owner shall be held responsible for his  act. I rise to speak in support of the Motor  Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, 2019 which seeks to replace the Motor Vehicles  (Amendment) Act, 1988.  It contains several good provisions which will go a long  way in making India's road safer.  I appreciate the provision of providing cashless  treatment to the road accident victims which will help in saving a lot of lives.  The  Government should take the State Governments also on board in its bid to  implement provisions of this Bill.  I want to ask the Government whether the  electronic monitoring of the road safety would be done on the National Highways,  State Highways or the urban roads.  The Government should also clarify as to who  is going to bear the cost of this electronic monitoring of the road safety: Is it the  Central Government or the State Government?  Moreover, the Road Safety Board  should have all the power  to look into the compliance, monitoring of the  compliance and levy penalties.    This amendment Bill is a good step   towards the road safety.  I would like to urge the Government that a stern action  should be taken against the officers issuing driving licence to an untrained person.   I would like to suggest the Government in this regard.  There should be a provision  for strict examination before issuing licence to the drivers and prior to it intensive  training should be ensured for them.  The act should have the provisions to punish  the contractors who are found guilty of showing laxity in the construction and  upkeeping of the roads. At the same time, the responsibility of higher officers  should also be fixed.  A world class Driver Training Institute should be set up in  every district keeping in view the shortage of drivers in our country.  The CSR  fund should be utilised for this purpose.  I would like to thank the Government for  promoting the use of non-conventional energy and at the same time getting people  rid of environment pollution by exempting electronic vehicles from taxes. In the first place, I, on behalf of my  party, welcome you with all my heart. It is a matter of pride that you will steer this  House for a period of five years occupying the chair of Hon. Speaker and all of us  will receive your invaluable guidance.  There are a number of parties in this House  with merely one, two or three Members and my party is no different on this count  that has only two elected Members.  The implication is that small parties like ours  need your protection the most in order that we may get ample opportunity to put  forward our views through you.  Hon. Prime Minister has elaborated on your  exposure to Parliamentary practice at length, I do not wish to reiterate the same.  I  am fully confident that the great legacy of our first hon. Speaker Shri G.V.  Mavlankar and the legacy of his successesors would be further strengthened in  your tenure.  Alongside, all of us would recieve an encouragement to strengthen  Parliamentary democracy by way of your guidance.  On behalf of my party, I  assure you to extend my whole-hearted support in the smooth conduct of the  business of the House. I just wish to witness an enhanced glory of this House in  your illustrious tenure. Whenever you sit on the Chair, we feel  proud.  Our Government has done so many things in the interest of the people and  the country.  Yesterday, portrait of late Atalji was inaugurated.   His memory has  been preserved forever in the Central Hall.  India is the largest democracy of the  world. We have to make this democracy more strong and for that the Opposition  and treasury benches will have to move ahead together.  You have given me and  all other Members the opportunity to express our opinion without any partiality. Some of the people suddenly get  hyperactive whenever the issue of chit fund or ponzi scheme is raised.  The entire  country is aware that the Left Front Government of the West Bengal brought in  this Bill to ban this scheme in 2002.  If the erstwhile Union Government had  acceded to that Bill, such a large number of persons would not have lost  their  money.  Therefore, I would like to support and thank the hon. Finance Minister for  bringing in this Bill.  I would like to make a demand that appropriate measures  should be taken to return the money to the poor people. The Hon. Speaker, Madam, gave me  opportunities to speak on behalf of my party on all issues. She conducted the  House in an orderly manner.  I congratulate and thank her for this.  I congratulate  the hon. Prime Minister also who gave the slogan, \\u2018Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas\\u2019 and  \\u2018Corruption Free India\\u2019. I am in favour of this Bill.  The middle class  and the poor have been widely affected by such chit funds.  A Srijan scam has  taken place in our State which needs to be discussed.  This Bill brought in by the  hon. Minister is a welcome move. This Bill has been brought in with a view to  amending the Rules to Jallianwala Bagh Memorial Committee Trust.  It is not a  celebration.  When Sikhs were being subjected to assault way back in 1984, our  leader Bala Sahab had strictly warned not to hurt the Sikhs even to the least degree.   I welcome the Amendments moved by the Government.  Jallianwala Bagh is not  associated with any particular religion, faith or even a state for that matter.  This  episode inflicted pain across the country.  I support the Amendments moved  relating to the trustees of  Jallianwala Bagh Memorial Committee. It is a very difficult task to conduct  the business in the House.  But, you made successful attempt in running the House  in the best possible manner.  Hon. Prime Minister also made efforts to carry  everyone along.  Therefore, I congratulate him.  Everyone should participate in the  discussion in the House and everyone should also ensure that the House runs  smoothly.   This Parliament is a great institution.  I  congratulate our Hon. Prime Minister for the passage of various important Bills.   The job of the Speaker is very difficult.  I represent the Other Backward Castes of  India. I only hope today that in the next Lok Sabha and in the subsequent Lok  Sabhas, the voices of the marginalized section of society will be heard.  India has  seen a tremendous leader and a dynamic Prime Minister in Narendra Modi Ji and  we have more of him to see in future. During the last five years, our Government  has been implementing the policies for the benefit of the villages, the poor, the  farmers, the exploited, the downtrodden, the middle class and the students and this  budget is the ultimate compliment to these policies.  This discussion is on the  Finance Bill, however, my predecessor was speaking on budget.  Such irrelevant  discussions dent the image of politicians.  Yesterday, the Floor Leader of a party  was saying that the Government is not releasing the report on black money  whereas the fact is that the Members of the Finance Committee can access the said  report.  The Economic Survey of 2004 said that the Vajpayee Government had  given a robust economy to the country.  The Economic Survey of 2014 says that  the preceding Government had left the economy of the country in a bad shape.   The Congress Party is constantly quoting the name of HAL whereas this is only a  company.  When the Modi Government came to power, it immediately constituted  the SIT  on black money.  The reason for black money generation in the country  was that the rates of income tax used to be very high.  If we want to develop, we  have to make our country a tax paying country.  MSME Sector has got the  maximum benefits from this Finance Bill.  This is the first Government ever to  thank the tax payers.  The theory of 'One Nation One Tax' is not a new theory but  we have got a Prime Minister for the first time who could implement this theory in  the form of GST.  This Finance Bill is going to benefit the middle-class, the poor  and the villages.  With these words, I support this Bill.  By allocating more Budget for 13 Ministries especially  related with public affairs under this Finance Bill 2019-20, the Government has  shown its farsightedness.  In this country, it has been tried to provide assistance to  12 crore farmers through Pradhan Mantri Samman Nidhi.  The Government has  provided soil health card and brought 22 crops for the first time under Minimum  Support Price and increased it by 50 to 90 per cent.  Shram Yogi Yojana has been  introduced under which when a labourer is rendered incapable after 60 years of  age, he/she will get a pension of at least Rs. 3000/-.  For the first time this  Government has paid attention towards the Development of rural infrastructure and  under Pradhan Mantri Sadak Yojana a budget of Rs.19 thousand crore has been  allocated by covering 98 percent of the small villages and dhanis.  Through Mudra  Scheme girls have been made self reliant without any capital security guarantee.   About 50 crore poor Indians were not able to get medical treatment.  Ayushman  Bharat Scheme is such a scheme of India in the world under which each poor will  get medical treatment.  The middle class will get a tax rebate of income upto Rs.5  lakh.  For the first time provision for providing reservation to economically weaker  sections of the upper caste has been made.  Entire India has got a new direction  through this Budget.  This Budget will prepare new infrastructure for the  development of this country and will uplift the poor people of lower class.   I congratulate the hon. Minister of  Finance for understanding the issues of the middle class salaried people and  providing them maximum relief. Hence forth, person having annual income upto  Rs. 5 lakh will be exempted from paying any tax. Approximately three crore  existing tax payers will be benefited by it. Standard deduction has been raised from  Rs. 40 thousand to Rs. 50 thousand. It is a commendable step. The abundance of  benefits notwithstanding the revenue generation through income tax is estimated to  be approximately Rs. 13 lakh 80 thousand crore by the year 2020. I thank the hon.  Prime Minister for the code of conduct of 'Collective Efforts Inclusive Growth'  (Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas). The present Government is working  with a mission for the bright future of this country.  People from across the world  have come and taken a holy dip in the ongoing \\u2018Kumbh Mela\\u2019 and everyone is  saying that 80 percent water of the Ganga river has become pollution free.  Couple  of years earlier no one could ever imagine that the same Ganga would be flowing  uninterrupted and be pollution free.  Earlier yoga was not so popular but now the  world has accepted that Yoga is the contribution and a gift of India to the world.   The International Day of Yoga has been accepted by the whole world.  When this  Government came in power in 2014, the youth and farmers of the country were  feeling let down everywhere. There was feeling of desperation in people  everywhere.  But today India is being recognized worldwide.  The Government has  taken many steps like rolling out Swachch Bharat Mission, constructing toilets,  launching Jan-Dhan Yojana and opening medical colleges etc.  Earlier there were  just three medical colleges in my Parliamentary Constituency Jharkhand in the last  50-60 years but now 8 medical colleges have been opened within the span of four  years only.  Even AIIMS has been opened there.  Roads have been constructed in  every village under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana.  All this instilled a sense  of confidence in the farmers and the youth.  So, now India is going to be  prosperous in future and became world Guru once again. The budget of  our government under the leadership of the hon'ble Prime Minister is a growth  oriented budget. Central Government is going to implement \\\"Pradhan Mantri  Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana\\\" to provide annual financial assistance of Rs. 6,000/-  to the 12 crore farmers having landholding of up to two hectares. Income up to Rs.  5 lakh has been made tax free. Labourers in the unorganised sector would be  provided monthly pension of Rs. 3000/- after completing the age of 60, for which  they have to make contribution of Rs. 100 per month. Gokul Mission Scheme has  been launched to promote animal husbandry in the rural areas. Budget allocation of  Rs. 3 lakh crore has been made for the defence sector, out of which maximum  amount is proposed to be utilized for procurement of new defence equipments. The budget of our Government is  based on the principle of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' and it is every person's budget.  It is budget of the poor, young people, farmers, middle class, small traders. It is a  budget of more than 3.5 crore middle class families. It is a budget of more than 12  crore farmers and 30 crore workers. It is a budget with right intention and a budget  for building a new India. The Government has increased MSP by 1.5 times and has  worked to ensure the availability of urea to farmers. The Government have started  Pradhan Mantri Kissan Samman Nidhi (PM-Kissan). The Government has  increased allocation of National Gokul Mission to Rs. 750.00 crores. It has been  decided to provide 2% rebate on interest to farmers engaged in Animal Husbandry  and Fishery. In case of natural calamity the farmers are unable to repay their loans,  their loans would be rescheduled and it has been decided to extend 2 per cent  interest rebate for the first year of the rescheduled loan. Maximum number of  soldiers in our Armed Force and Para Military Forces hails from my Parliamentary  Constituency, Jhunjhunu. For the first time ever the defence budget is crossing 3  lakh crore rupees. Almost each and every village of the country has been  connected with roads through Pradhan Mantri Grameen Sadak Yojana. Today poor  women are being provided with free Gas Connection under Ujjawala Yojana.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana is being started to provide high class free treatment to  poor. Government is working to provide electricity to each and every household of  the country. Today, around 2 crore 47 lakh households have been provided with  electricity connection under Pradhan Mantri Soubhagya Yojana. The last budget of 16th Lok Sabha  is a prosperity and development oriented budget. When India celebrates its 75th  year of independence each and every one will have toilet facility, electricity, water  sewage connection and the farmers will have double income and it will be caste,  dynasty and terrorism free and an empowered country. We have reined in inflation.  We have brought in a radical change in the field of taxation by paving way for  Goods and Service Tax (GST). We have initiated a new era of transparency. We  have run a corruption free Government. The budget is going to prove a revolutionary  step for development and uplift of all sections of the society. The Pradhan Mantri  Kisan Sampada Yojana, one Rank-One-Pension Scheme for the defence personnel,  Skill Development Scheme and Khelo India for the youth are the major initiatives  of the Government. India has ranked 5th  in defence power with setting up 108  satellites in the space. I welcome these measures undertaken by the Government. The Government is moving forward to realise  the dream of 'New India' by the year 2022. Our economy is the fastest growing  economy in the word and achieved highest growth rate in these 5 years since the  economic reforms started in 1991. Today, India is the 6th largest economy. The  Government has successfully achieved highest growth rate, controlled two digit  inflation and maintained fiscal balance. India has also attracted huge FDI  amounting nearly 239 billion USD during the last 5 years. Last 5 years have seen  the fast infrastructural reforms and have paved the path for higher growth rate for  many coming decades. I am happy to know that the 22th AIIMS is going to be set- up in Haryana. Targeted development works are being carried out in 115 most  backward districts under Aspirational District Programme. For the first time, the  MSP of all 22 crops was announced at least 50% more than their input cost. The  government is going to launch a historical programme named Pradhan Mantri  Kisan Samman Nidhi PM-Kisan with annual outlay of Rs. 75 thousand crore to  ensure certain fixed income for small and marginal farmers. The Government has  taken decision to set up a separate department for fishery. New Pension Scheme  has been more libralised by increasing the share of government from 10% to 14%  while retaining the employees' share of 10%. The minimum wage for all category  employees has also increased by 42%.  42 crore workers of the un-organised sector  contribute nearly 50% in the total GDP of the country. The Government has  proposed to initiate a comprehensive pension programme named Pradhan Mantri  Shram Yogi Maandhan for these workers of unorganised sector. The Government  has also proposed to set up a Welfare Development Board under Social Justice and  Empowerment Ministry with the aims to implement welfare and development  programmes meant for denotified, nomadic and semi-nomadic communities. More  than 1 crore youths are being trained under PM Kaushal Vikas Yojana so that they  may earn their livelihood. All these efforts have made India world's second largest  start-up hub. The government has envisaged a national programme for Artificial  Intelligence and allied technologies so that its benefits reach masses. Many  effective measures have been taken to strengthen the small and medium  enterprises. The government has set up government e-market place two years ago.  The total transaction amounting Rs. 17,500 crore has been done through this GeM  and has resulted in average of savings of 25% to 28%. It is for the first time that  defence budget for 2019-20 is going to cross the Rs,3,00,000 crore. Now more than  100 airports are operational in the country. Domestic air traffic has grown two  times in the last 5 years. India has become fastest highways developer country in  the world. The railway passengers are getting world classes facilities with the  operation indigenously designed and manufactured semi-high speed train Vande- Bharat Express. The people of North-East region are also getting the benefits of  infrastructure development. The government is going to start containers cargo  transportation in the North-Eastern region through Brahmaputra by improving  navigation capacity of the river. For the first time, Arunachal Pradesh has made its  place on civil aviation map and Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizorm on India's railway  map. Now, India has become the largest data consumption country in the world.  The number of companies manufacturing mobile and mobile components has  increased from 2 to 268. The government has reduced the tax rate. The  implementation of GST of undoubtedly the biggest tax reform after independence.  The government in committed to wipeout the evil of black money. The  development in our government has transformed into mass movement. My  constituency Misrikh is one of the most backward areas in the country. It needs fast  development work. Last year also, I made a demand to construct an embankment  on the left bank on the river Ganga flowing from my constituency. There is a need  to construct ROBs and RUBs on all the unmanned level crossings there.   PROF. SAUGATA ROY: This year unemployment is at an all-time 45  years high, at 6.1 per cent.  National Sample Survey Organization data has not  been published.  The Government is not allowing them to publish the data on  unemployment which is at a very bad state.  Total Non-Performing Assets of the  banks have crossed rupees 11 and a half crore, an all-time high.  The Government  has not been able to bring back the people who fled with bank\\u2019s money.  The  Interim Finance Minister has presented an \\u2018Account for Votes\\u2019.  This is only a  vote-oriented Budget.  The Government has tried to apply \\u2018betadine\\u2019 to the wounds  created by demonetization.  Ultimately, the Government has not been able to bring  back black money into the system.  The Government has gone on changing the tax  rates as a result of which the GST collection this year is Rs. one lakh crore which  is less than  the previous budged.  The Andhra people have a justified demand for a  special category status, but that is not being listened to.  I would urge the  Government to announce something about it.  The Government has announced  Rs.6000 per year per family which comes to Rs.500 per month and Rs.17 per  family per day.  It is too little and too late.  Provident Fund-linked Pension Scheme  too does not sound promising at all. The Government has presented an  expansionary Budget and prioritized populism over fiscal prudence.  This Budget  is not showing any direction to the country.  The Government is not capable of  delivering a good economic system.  I oppose this Budget. I am thankful that you have given me the  opportunity to speak on the Interim Budget dedicated to \\\"Prosperous Farmer  Healthy India\\\". Our Government has been successful in checking the double digit  inflation. Our Government has introduced a scheme to provide minimum income  of Rs. 6000 per annum to provide relief to small and marginal farmers. Our  Government has recovered three lakh crores rupees from big defaulter companies.  Electricity will be provided to all the 2.5 crores houses till March 2019, which are  deprived of it. The work of Saubhagya scheme is almost complete. The  Government has announced to increase the limit of gratuity from 10 lakh rupees to  20 lakh rupees.  Rupees 3000 per month will be given to the employees of  unorganised sector. Undeclared income of 1.30 lakh crore rupees has been detected  through steps taken by the Government including demonetisation to check the evils  of black money. There is a proposal to double the income tax rebate by increasing  it upto five lakh rupees to provide relief to middle class people. Three crore middle  class taxpayers will be benefitted by this proposal. The farmers who are facing  natural calamities will be given two percent interest subsidy and the farmers who  are repaying the loan in time will be given three percent interest subsidy to  overcome the crises in agricultural sector. The Government will provide 750 crore  rupees to help animal husbandry and fisheries. The Minimum Support Price for 22  notified crops has been fixed 50 percent more than the input cost. The Government  has sanctioned 15.56 lakh loans of 7.23 lakh crores of rupees under Mudra Yojana  and a major part of its beneficiaries are women. Six crore gas connections have  already been provided to poor women out of eight crore free LPG connections  under Ujjwala Yojana. At present 100 airports are operational in the country and  the traffic has doubled during the last five years. India is at the forefront in the  world in developing the highways. All the unmanned level crossings have been  abolished. A national programme on artificial intelligence will be introduced to  provide the benefit of artificial intelligence and the related technology to the  people. India has become the  maximum mobile data user country in the world.  One lakh villages will be made digital during the next five years. I believe that  equal focus has been given to all the sectors from agriculture to the basic  infrastructure in this Budget. This budget is beneficial for farmers and the common  men. This Budget shall empower the  poor, strengthen the farmers, honour the labourers and fulfil the dreams of the  middle class.  This Budget will enhance the purchasing power of the middle class.   The IMF report of the year 2018 acknowledges India as the fastest growing  economy among the emerging economies of the world.  The global performance of  the country has increased and we have climbed to 71st position from 142nd position  in ease of doing business.  The gratuity limit along with income tax has been raised  from 10 lakh to 20 lakh rupees for common man.

Inflation rate has plummeted from  10 per cent to 4.5 per cent.  The Defence Budget has crossed Rs. 3 lakh crore for  the first time.  More than Rs. 6 crore have been allocated for the Railways and no  increase has been made in the passenger fare.  All unmanned crossings on  broadgauge network have been removed.  Semi high speed train \\u2018Vandebharat\\u2019 has  been introduced which is first indigenously developed long train.  More than Rs.  93 thousand crore and Rs. 11 thousand crore have been allocated for Shiksha  Yojana and Mid Day Meal Scheme respectively.  35.6 per cent and 28 per cent  increase has been made in the budgetary allocation for the Scheduled Castes and  Scheduled Tribes category respectively. Our Government has, in the Interim Budget taken  care of every section of the country.  By providing relief to the farmers, labourers  and tax payers in the budget, our Government has opened new doors of  development for these people.  Prior to 2014 General Elections, the farmers, the  poor people, the labourers and the backward classes were struggling for their  existence and inflation had overburdened the common citizen.  In 2014 General  Elections, the people voted in favour of Bharatiya Janata Party Government and  showed faith in it regarding creation of a new India.  Our Government has stepped  up fast in the direction of fulfilling the dreams of new India.  Our Government, in  its tenure of four and a half years, prepared its schemes keeping in view every  section of the country and implemented it effectively.  Our Government has made  arrangement like housing, insurance, gas connection for the poor and Soil Health  Card for the farmers.  All facilities have been provided to the farmers, students,  people working in unorganised sector, housewives and people belonging to the  working class so as to ensure all-round development of the country.  The  Government has launched Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Scheme.  Under  this scheme, Rs. 6000/- per year will be provided to those farmers who are having  less than 2 hectares of land holding.  Now India has become the world's sixth  largest economy whose GDP is likely to be around 8%.  2% exemption in loans  will be given to the farmers in case of natural calamities and 3% in case the  farmers who repay their loans on time.  Kamdhenu Yojana has been launched for  the protection of cows.  An amount of 750 crore rupees is likely to be spend on this  scheme.  Bonus, being given to the soldiers of the country, has been increased from  Rs. 3500 to Rs. 7000/-.  The honorarium of all workers, working under Anganwadi  Scheme has been increased by 50%.

The Government has made announcement regarding  allocation of 60,000 crore rupees for MGNREGA. The Government will convert  one lakh villages into digital villages over the next five years.  During the last four  and a half years, our Government has run a corruption free Government which is  committed only for development of the country. The Government under the leadership of Shri  Narendra Modi has given free LPG connections to 6 crore families.  Now, it has  been announced in the Budget that 2 crore more families will be given free LPG  connections.  A  pension scheme has been announced  for 10 crore labourers  working in the unorganised sector .  The Government will deposit Rs.2000 in the  accounts of farmers directly before 31st March.  I wish to extend my thanks to the  hon. Finance Minister for all these things.  Senior citizens were paying TDS on  bank interest.  In this budget that interest of Rs.10,000 has been enhanced upto  Rs.40,000.  Reserve Bank has reduced .25 BPS interest rate.  It means that lakhs of  home buyers have been benefited.  In the end, I would like to say that this is the  only Government which fights for the poor.    This is a very progressive budget.  Many provisions have been made to make farmers prosperous. Farmers engaged in  animal husbandry and fisheries have been given three percent rebate on interest  rate. Small farmers having a land holding of five acre are going to be provided  with six thousand rupees per farmer as assistance. Provision for Pension to  Labourers from unorganised sector has been made. Army has been given a budget  of three lakh crore. Deen Dayal Upadhyay Jeevan Jyoti Yojana has been launched  to provide electricity to every household. Health Insurance cover of upto five lakhs  has been provided to every poor family under Ayushman Bharat Yojana. The Government formed in 2014  under the leadership of the hon. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is totally  corruption free.     The NDA Government has brought down inflation rate to 4.6, fiscal deficit  to 3.4 percent and made untiring efforts to encourage direct investment.    There was uneven distribution of land and property in the country and the  present Government has made efforts to do away with it.  Further, the Government  has brought rural poor and middle class under the Banking system.    The Government has focused on sanitation and allocated crores of rupees to  State Governments for construction of toilets in villages.  It has taken historical  decision to provide 10 percent reservation in Government jobs and educational  institutions for economically weaker sections in general category so that the people  may get justice.  Many measures have been taken to provide foodgrains at cheaper  rates to poor and middle class and huge gap between facilities of cities and villages  has been narrowed.      This Government is farmer friendly and working towards doubling of their  income and launching certain schemes for them.  It has taken care of health  facilities for the people of the country and done considerable work in the field of  animal husbandry, fisheries and dairy sector.  Also, it has taken care of farmers,  fishermen, labourers, businessmen, industrialists and people related to rural  business.  I support the interim budget of 2019-20. This is a budget for new India. For  one Rank One Pension Scheme Rupees 35 thousand crore have been allocated. A  new department for fisheries has been opened. Provision of providing Rupees three  thousand as pension labourer of unorganised sector after 60 years of age has been  made. 10 percent reservation to the poors from upper castes has been provided.  Budget allocation for defence has increased by three thousand crore. We have  become 6th major economy in the world. The Interim Budget 2019-20 has  adequately    focused on the progress and growth of the people. This budget will help in the  years to come to make a new India. In this budget measures have been initiated for  the balanced development of the Country. The Government has for the first time  constituted Navin Kalyan Vikas board for the welfare of nomadic tribes. Various  schemes like Ujjwala Yojana, Mudra Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Matri Vandana  Yojana etc. have been initiated for the Welfare of women in the country. Under  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana all margined farmers holding two  acres of land will be provided 6000/- rupees each year. The Government has  constituted Rashtriya Gokul Mission for the welfare of the Cow progeny  and also  initiated various measures for animal husbandry and fisheries. More than 600 Jan  Aushadi Kendras have been setup  to make available  medicines at affordable  prices to the poor people of the Country. On the occasion of 150th Birth  Anniversary of Mahatama Gandhi ji this Government has presented a budget for  benefit of  poor, farmers, labourers and youths. This Government has not only  achieved high growth rate but also controlled inflation and brought down fiscal  deficit from 6 percent to 3.4 percent. The Government has achieved 98 percent  target of rural sanitation and succeeded in declaring almost 5.45 lakh villages open  defecation free villages.

The  Government has provided 6 crore LPG connections free of cost under Ujjwala  Yojana and made a provision of maternity leave of 36 weeks to pregnant working  women. This Government has rationalised custom duty and procedures to  encourage Make in India initiative. The Government has prepared a vision for next  10 years and if this vision is implemented in coming 10 years the country will  certainly move forward on the path of progress. This Government has brought a new ray of  hope in the lives of poor people by providing 10% reservation in educational  institutions and jobs to economically weaker people.  About 12 crore small and  marginal farmers of our country used to face money crunch to purchase seeds and  fertilizers at the time of sowing.  Now with the launch of Pradhan Mantri Kisan  Samman Nidhi Yojna our farmers will no longer require to struggle for  procurement of seeds and fertilizers during three cycles of sowing seasons and they  will not get trapped into moneylenders' net.   The Government has taken a  historical decision in the budget to set up Rashtriya Kamdhenu Aayog for genetic  upgradation of bovine resources to enhance the milk productivity of cows. Besides,  a provision of Rs.750 crores has also been made for 'Rashtriya Gokul Mission'.  In  addition to it the sharecroppers should also be provided financial assistance from  the Calamity Relief Fund alongwith the farmers who get the benefit of crop  insurance in the event of natural calamity. I support this Budget  which ensures the development of the country for the next 10 years. This Interim  Budget is not the full Budget. The Budget which will be presented after the  Elections will be such which will usher in Acche Din and Sabka Saath Sabka  Vikas. With the announcement of providing more financial benefits to the soldiers,  the feeling of honour among soldiers has increased. Alongwith rebate in income  tax, the Budget has provided many things to the common man. About 60 crore  people are likely to be benefited by schemes like Kisan Samman Yojna, Ayushman  Yojna and pension for the workers of the unorganised sector. With the decision to  set up Rashtriya Kamdhenu Ayog and a separate department for fisheries, there  sectors will become stronger economically. This budget is the foundation of  development journey of new India. The common man will benefit a lot from new  provisions of income tax.

The Ten Points explained in the budget will  prove helpful in the building of an empowered India. For the first time, the  Government has allocated defence budget of more than 3 lakh crore rupees. This  budget is a reflection of a new India by the year 2022 which will include clean and  healthy citizen and environment, toilet in every house, electricity and water to  everyone, doubling of farmer's income and the building of an India free from  terrorism, casteism, communalism, corruption and nepotism. This budget has shown the glimpse of a strong  economy.

Target of setting up of more than 3  lakh service centre has been fixed to provide service facility to the people.  India is  considered to be the first front runners with regard to the use of mobile data. I hope that the objectives of  social inclusion, growth in jobs and most importantly farmer welfare are ultimately  achieved.  I would like to thank the Government for the Pradhan Mantri Kisan  Samman Nidhi Scheme wherein a sum of Rs. 6000 would be deposited directly in  the farmers\\u2019 bank account every year.  More than 12.5 crores farmers will benefit  from this.  Similarly, the Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maandhan assures a monthly  pension of Rs. 3000 for workers in the unorganized sector.  Special trust should be  paid for rural road development under Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana.  The  Hon. Finance Minister has offered a full tax rebate for individuals whose total  income is below Rs. 5,00,000.  It is estimated that 3 crore middle class tax payers  would benefit from this proposal.  To boost affordable housing, tax exemptions for  development of housing projects are extended by a year which are further likely to  accelerate construction and provide a boost to the real estate sector.  In this Budget  an emphasis has been given to technological development, creation of digital  infrastructure and digitalization of governance.  A healthy allocation of Rs. 3 L  crore towards Defence can transform India\\u2019s defence preparedness and secure our  long term strategic interests.  Overall, this has been an expansionary Budget with  an equal emphasis on all strata\\u2019s of the society. Our Prime Minister has given a  stable and transparent Government to the country through his farsightedness and  able leadership.  This Government has started working towards making \\u201cNew  India\\u201d by 2022 which is free from terrorism, communalism, castism, corruption  and discrimination.  Today we have become a sixth largest economy of the world.   The Government has reduced the rate of inflation to 4.6 per cent and brought down  the fiscal deficit in 2018-19 RE to 3.4 per cent which was almost at its highest  level of 6 per cent earlier. While taking steps against corruption and black money  our Government has cracked down on economic offenders through The Fugitive  Economic Offenders Act 2018 and The Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act,  1988.  The Government has now ensured 10% reservation in educational institutes  and jobs for poor while maintaining the existing reservation provided to SCs/ STs/  OBCs.  The Government has spent 1,70,000 crore rupees in the year 2018-19 to  provide foodgrains to poor and middle class families at affordable prices which is  almost double the amount of 92,000 crore rupees spent in the year 2013-14.

Several necessary steps have been taken by  the Government to double the income of farmers. Large number of power  connection have been provided under Saubhagya Yojana in my Parliamentary  Constituency Sidhi. I distribute gas under Ujjwala in almost my every programme.  Our Government has shown commitment of providing Pucca houses to all poor  families by 2022 who have kachcha houses. My Parliamentary Constituency Sidhi  has largely been benefited from Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. Our Government  has given a new lease of life to Lalitpur-Singrauli rail project which had been  pending since long and a gift of rupees 325 crore has been received for the purpose  and a allocation of rupees 300 crore has been made for doubling of Katni-Singrauli  route. This is priceless gift for me and people of my Constituency. In this Budget there is provision for  increased allocation for Rastriya Gokul Mission to 750 crore in current year. Two  per cent interest subvention to farmers pursuing animal husbandry and fisheries.  \\\"Urgent action needed to increase hydrocarbon production to decrease imports;  Committee under NITI Aayog to be set up to identify and denotify nomadic and  semi-nomadic communities; Welfare Development Board to be set up; Pradhan  Mantri Shram Yogi Mandhan, to provide assured monthly pension. (This) will  benefit 10 crore workers in unorganized sector. Under Pradhan Mantri Kisan  Samman Nidhi, 6000 rupees per year for each farmer in three installments, this  initiative is likely to benefit 12 crore small and marginal farmers. Hon. Finance Minister has  presented a historic budget which is welfare and development oriented facilitating  India to emerge as a superpower at the global stage.  The world bank has said that  India will be one of the fastest growing economy of the world with the growth rate  of 7.5 per cent.  The report of the Development Centre of Harvard University has  also revealed that Indian Economy will be at the pinnacle of fastest growing  economy of the world in the coming decade.  I would like to congratulate the hon.  Prime Minister that we have become number one country of the world leaving the  USA behind in respect of FDI.  Today, India has emerged as the largest hub of  investment in the entire world.  Besides, we have jumped from 142nd to 77th  position in the Ease of Doing Business Index.  The number of tax payers has gone  up from 1.3 crore to 7.6 crore after the implementation of the GST.  The efforts are  being made to double the income of farmers by the year 2022.  For the first time,  11 crore farmers and vendors will avail of the facilities of online marketing  platform in the year 2018-19 and 1.27 crore farmers are likely to be benefitted  directly from this move. It is a matter of pride that our country is on the  path of development. Pending projects have been completed by the government.  There has been decline in the rate of inflation. Huge investments have been made  by foreign institutions. The government has worked for all the sections of the  society. Monthly GST collection has reached the level of approximately one lakh  crore rupees, which is one of the major achievements of this government.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana has created sense of security and confidence in crores of  families. Farmers have been benefitted greatly by measures like raising MSP one  and a half times, increasing the coverage of crop insurance to every household,  Neem coating of urea and making provision of assured annual financial assistance  to 12 crore farmer families. Every citizen of this country has been benefitted from  the development schemes in this interim Budget. The newly invention PM- Kisan Yojana is direct cash transfer to the farmer.  So the income support scheme  to farmers is good and no one will oppose it. We are all proud about Chandrayaan  and the hundred satellites launched with just one rocket. But madam how it is  helping the farmers in India? But none of the fisherman I able to use this data for  fishing. The single biggest worry is the jobless youth. Unemployment has actually  increased. On solar energy things went horrible wrong our policies were not right.  Many power producers as well as solar PV panel manufactures became bankrupt.  However, I am very glad about the recent plan of the government to put a mega  solar PV plant in Ladakh. We are happy at last the tribal university is allocated. It is indeed a wholesome budget taking care of  each and every section of society. Be it a major relief for taxpayers of nation or  income support to farmers through PM-KISAN, development of women,  empowering of youth, enhancement in Asha Yojana and Aanganwadi honorarium  by 50% or strengthening of defence and National Security, the budget took into  account all aspects for nation's development. Jandhan Yojana, inflation control and  UDAN are the success stories of the government. The government has announced  a scheme to provide Rs. 6000 annually to each and every small and marginal  farmer. Modiji himself belongs to a poor family, so he knows how poverty can be  alleviated. Modiji initiated many economic reforms to bail out fragile Indian  economy and a number of steps have been taken to improve the condition of the  poor. This government provided 8 crore free LPG connections to poor households  during the last 4 years. Ayushman Bharat is another example. Poor persons can  avail insurance cover by paying premium of only Rs. 12 annually. Inflation rate  was as low as 4% in 2018 during the NDA regime. The government has not only  controlled the price, but also has increased MSP by 150%. Shri Swaminathan has  also appreciated this scheme. This Prime Minister's attitude is nation should be first  in priority and not his family members. I am grateful to the Finance Minister for his  visionary ideas. The Union Budget has also reflected the Government's objectives  of comprehensive development of each and every section of the society. The  Government has been able to infuse new hope and confidence among the people of  the Country. Shri Narendra Modiji has been made all out effort to improve the life  of every Indian. Schemes like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Ujjawala Yojana,  Ayushman Bharat Yojana for free treatment, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana,  Pradhan Mantri Soubhagya Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana will definitely  transform the destiny of the poor and the needy. The Social Security Schemes  announced in the Budget by the Government for uplifting the poor is a  commendable step. Shri Piyush Goyalji has presented a very pragmatic and people  friendly Budget that will benefit every section of the Society. The first and foremost important  individual is the farmer.  It is only when we can empower the farmer and the  agriculture sector, India will emerge stronger.  The Government has been  relentlessly working towards strengthening farmers and one such initiative through  this Budget is Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi.  Under this scheme farmers  holding up to 2 hectare of land will be given Rs.6000 per annum.  The number of  farmers who will get this benefit is huge.  This is the first time ever that any  Government has brought in the ambit of the budget the concerns of the  unorganised sector.   Budget 2019 has announced a mega pension scheme for  unorganised sector worker to provide assured pension of Rs.3000 rupees per month  to nearly 10 core people.  Those earning upto Rs.5 lakh a year will get full tax  rebate.  The Government has undertaken many effective steps to strengthen MSME  sector, which provides employment to crores of people.    'Housing for all' is a  priority for the Government.  And as per Budget 2019, as many as 1.53 crore  houses have been constructed under the flagship housing scheme Pradhan Mantri  Awas Yojana both in urban and rural segments.    A total of 28531 km national  highways were constructed since FY 2014-15, contrasting with 16505 km by the  UPA government up to FY 2013-14.  This is the commitment of our Government  towards infrastructure. Availing treatment free of cost under the Ayushman Bharat  has helped around 10 lakh people since its launch in September this year.  I would  like to congratulate our Hon'ble Finance Minister for presenting such a reformist  budget which addresses the concerns of almost all sections of the society. I rise to support the Hon. President\\u201fs  Address.  India in 2087 will be the world\\u201fs biggest democracy.  It will also  overtake China to be the world\\u201fs most populous country.

The present Government has made an effort to make Gandhiji's idea turn into  reality through its programmes and works. When the Government started thinking  in terms of well-being of poor middle class, it carried out cleanliness campaign  followed by providing toilets in each house and bringing it forward, it made an  effort to provide better and cheaper health facility by reducing the costs on  medicines through Jan Aushadi Kendras. When the Government started \\\"Ujjwala  Yojana\\\" our poor sister living in village got rid of the problems being faced while  cooking for the family. All these works are on the verge of completion within  scheduled time. Today, the whole opposition is misleading by showing the unity.  In such a situation, I believe that the people of the country will appreciate the  works done by the present Government. I support this motion in the House.  Our Government has performed on the ground. More than 4900 Jan Aushadhi  Kendras have been opened in more than 600 districts across the country.

Every Ministry has done an immense task to uplift those who were in need of  help.  Fifteen crore MUDRA loans have been sanctioned.  Seventy three per cent of those  loans has been given to women.  The women have benefited the most by this Government.

Our Government has not increased any tax  during the last five years.  We have climbed up from eleven to sixth position in GDP.  The  President's Address rightly mentions that we were sensitive to the needs of countless  helpless people.  After providing for ten per cent reservation to the economically backward  people our Government has presented a very popular budget. The President\\u201fs Address spelt out the  road map of the Government for the development of the country.  The BJP  Government has taken several measures for all round development of the country.

In the Ease of Doing Business Ranking, we are  now at 77th rank from a rank of 142 in 2014.  The Goods and Services Tax,  demonetisation and other legislations that have been brought into place has  formalized the economy.  This has benefitted all sections of society, especially the  poorest sections of society.  Indeed, the Government has worked hard towards  realization of aspirations of all the sections. Nation building is no longer controlled  by an elite few.  By reducing the cost of farming, providing the farmers with fair  price for their crops, providing access to new markets, our Government has  restored the farmer\\u201fs confidence.  Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana has ensured  crop insurance to farmers at low premiums to safeguard them from potential crisis  due to crop damage.  Providing rural santiation has been an important goal of our  Government and we have delivered.  Almost 5.45 lakh villages have been covered  in last four years.  Infrastructure creation and timely completion of projects has  been delivered by our Government.  In just 4 years, we now are at the 3rd position  in terms of number of start-ups in the world.

Our government not only took up the  challenges of 2014 and continued working on its plans but also delivered the  results. The Government has enhanced the dignity of the country in the world by  taking steps such as welfare of the poor, building infrastructure, women  empowerment, raising income of the farmers and securing the borders of the  country, containing inflation, corruption and terrorism at the same time.Today,  there is a conducive atmosphere for progress in the country and the country is  marching ahead.

Moreover, the President's Address has  also reflected the government's objectives of comprehensive development of each  and every section of society living in every nook and corner of the country. The  Social Security Scheme launched by the Government for uplifting the poor is a  commendable step. I whole heartedly thank the Hon'ble President of India for his  concern for the people of North-East India. These two bridges over the river  Brahmaputra will benefit lakhs of people of the region. The passing of the 103th  Amendment to the Constitution to extend the benefit of reservation of the poor  belonging to the general category is historic step towards eradication social  disparity.

This way, the dream  of creation of a new India will be realized. This Government is committed  towards the welfare of the downtrodden people.  Hon'ble President has also  appreciated the Government for implementing demonetisation and GST, providing  reservation to economically backward section and conducting surgical strike.   Providing 10 per cent reservation to the economically backward section is a  historical step.  Government has also taken various steps to provide basic  necessities to people and to curb the menace of black money and corruption.  Apart  from that, it has also taken many initiatives for the empowerment of poor people,  women, youth and middle class.  Today, India's voice is being heard with great  admiration on various global platforms.

The concept of One Nation-One Tax -  One Market has fructified as a result of comprehensive tax reforms such as the  GST.

With these words I strongly support the Motion of Thanks. The focus of the present Government  policies has been the welfare of the poor, middle class, the exploited and the  deprived sections, farmers, labourers and the youth of the country.  The Union  Government has taken significant steps in vital areas such as financial inclusion,  encouragement to small businesses, empowerment to the deprived communities,  housing construction, clean energy, sanitary campaign, rural electrification,  affordable and easily accessible health services, farmer welfare, women  empowerment, skill development, incentive to the entrepreneurship of Scheduled  Castes/Scheduled Tribes, welfare of the differently abled and their empowerment  and rural employment.  I thank the hon. President for this address dedicated to the  vision of all inclusiveness. The President's Address clearly manifests that  the incumbent government has put back the country on the path of faster growth  and development.  After 2014, the Government has rooted out the corruption and  has also brought an end to the uncertainties  owing to which people are reposing  their faith in the Government.  The Government has taken a big initiative in  providing training and skill development to the youths.  As many as 10000 skill  development centres and more than 600 Prime Minister Skill Centres have  augmented the skills of youth.  A loan of 7 lakh crore has been disbursed to about  15 crore people under the Mudra Scheme to start their industries and businesses.

Several welfare schemes have been launched in the  country so as to benefit the people at large. On 31st January, H.E. the President,  gave an historic and unprecedented address in which he mentioned demonetisation,  Rafale, GST, Surgical strike, One Rank One Pension, National Police Memorial,  Ujjawala Yojana, Ayushman Yojana, Mudra Yojana.  After the hard work by the  hon. Prime Minister, the Indian economy is the most promising economy in the  world today.  About Aadhaar card, the World Bank has said that the countries of  the world should follow the Indian system of Aadhaar card.  The way the  Government has taken steps for bringing together the benefits being provided to all  the beneficiaries through Aadhaar, even the World Bank has followed the IMF in  contending that poverty is being eradicated in India.  Direct benefit of more than  Rs.7 lakh crore has been provided to the poor through these schemes.  During the  UPA-I and UPA-II regime, 1 lakh 17 thousand crore rupees used to be pocketed by  the power brokers through corruption. The hon. Prime Minister has saved this  money of the people of this country.  'Work is Worship', H.E. President has  mentioned it.  Following this, an environment of development is being created in  the country today by establishing more than 3 lakh common service centres, by  seizing benami properties worth 50,000 crore rupees and by increasing the Income  Tax base from 3.5 crore to 7 crore.  Keeping in view, the picture of India presented  by H.E. the President  in his Address and the growing confidence of the people in  this Government, I support this motion of thanks. This Government has taken a  pledge for a 'New India', an India where nobody remains hungry, where everyone  gets basic healthcare and education.   This Government has tried to complete all  the suspended good initiatives of previous Governments.  Today, the railway lines  are expanding at a rapid rate, the port development is under focus, gas pipelines are  being laid, the fertiliser plants that were shut down are again being started, toilets  are being built in crores of households and new opportunities of employment are  coming up.  Be it a city or a village, the Government is trying to strengthen the  health related infrastructure.  The Government has launched the Saubhagya  Scheme to connect the households with electricity.   The benefits of Government  schemes are reaching the masses.  The poorest of poor are getting basic needs of  life fulfilled, from healthcare to sanitation, education to cooking gas, and much  more.  This Government has launched 'Ayushaman India Scheme' last year.   Medicines are being provided at more than 700 of such centres at very low cost.   The direct benefit transfers are also reaching the poor without any pilferage.    The  Government is trying to double the income of the country's farmers a first of its  kind initiative taken by any Government.  Goods and Services Tax (GST) has  made business easy in every part of the country.  More than 31 crore bank accounts  have been opened under Jan Dhan Yojana.  We have transferred the 27 crore  rupees of unclaimed money to their bank accounts with the help of Universal  Account Number.  Under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana loans of more than 10  lakh crore rupees have been approved.  Under UDAN scheme, 12 lakh seats have  been made available to the people at a reduced price.  We are also monitoring the  work of roads and railways with the help of drones.  Today more than 115 crore  people have Aadhaar cards.  Funds are being deposited by Direct Benefit Transfer  in the accounts of the poor for about 450 schemes of the Central Government.   Women have been the greatest beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.   Six crore women have also joined self-help groups under the Deendayal Antodaya  Yojana.  Maternity leaves have been extended from 12 weeks to 26 weeks.  The  Government is trying to bring about an end to the practice of triple talaq.  More  than 6 crore gas connections in houses under the Ujjwala scheme.  In the last four  and a half years, our Government has worked towards social and economic  development of the society.   No one can deny the truth that the India is emerging  stronger under the leadership of our Hon'ble PM. Against this backdrop and track  record of the Government, I can confidently say that very soon India will emerge  as an economic and social super-power under the leadership of our Hon'ble Prime  Minister. The Government has made a  historical move by determining 2022 the target year for providing houses to all.   The works done by the Government under the Swachha Bharat Mission is being  appreciated by the whole world.  The poor women are being provided gas  connections free of cost under the Ujjwala Scheme and as a result of which the  quality of their lives is improving.  About 2.47 crore households got electric  connections in the country under the Pradhan Mantri Saubhagya Yojana of the  Government.  Our Government has launched the Aayushman Bharat Yojana but  the Congress ruled States have not so far implemented this scheme. First of all I would like to express my gratitude  to the hon. Prime Minister for conferring the award of Bharat Ratna on Nanaji  Deshmukh who chose Chitrakoot of my Parliamentary Constituency, Satna as his  place of work.  I would like to submit that the economy of the country has acquired  the growth rate of 7.3 per cent during the last four and a half years.  India's  contribution to the world GDP was 2.6 per cent in 2014 and the same has gone up  to 3.3 per cent.  The Government has formulated schemes keeping the basic  requirements of every individual in view.  In my Parliamentary Constituency of  Satna, 1,70,000 beneficiaries have been provided gas connections under the  Ujjwala scheme.  44,475 houses have been approved for construction under  Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and out of them the construction of 37,117 houses  has been completed.  2,05,800 Golden Cards have been issued to the people in my  district under the Ayushmaan Bharat Yojana.  44,826 connections have already  been provided in the Satna district under the Saubhagya Yojana.  The Modi  Government has done justice to the poor of the upper castes by providing them 10  per cent reservation.  I would like to thank the Government once again by saying  this much that the scenario of the rural and urban areas is changing and the poor  people have started believing that they might be free from problems.  The hon.  Prime Minister has provided an honest Government during the last five years.  The  way the charges of corruption are being levelled against our Government is not  conducive to the fabric of democracy. The country is celebrating 150th birth  anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation with gusto.  Hon.  President in his speech has highlighted all the aspects.  The country was passing  through a phase of uncertainty before the General Election of the year 2014.  After  formation of this Government, a resolution has been taken to make a new India.   The objective of this transparent Government was \\u2018Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas\\u2019.   Nine crore toilets have been constructed under Swach Bharat Mission.  More than  six crore gas connections have been provided under Ujjawala Yojana till date.  Gas  connections have been provided to 1,15,000 women in my Parliamentary  Constituency.  A provision has been made to provide cash incentives upto Rs.5  lakh each family each year in case of serious illness under Ayushman Bharat  Yojana.   The Government is also providing 6.5 per cent interest to the people of  low income group under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.  Two crore 47 lakh homes  have already been connected with electricity till date.  In my Parliamentary  Constituency 1042 villages, mohallas have been electrified. Out of 15 crore, 73 per  cent women entrepreneurs have received MUDRA loan in all over the country.   National Sports University has been set up.  The Government is making efforts day  and night to double the farmers\\u2019 income.  Soil Health Cards have been distributed,  availability of fertilizers has been ensured and 100 % neem coating of urea has also  been ensured.  In my Parliamentary Constituency 446 village Panchayats have  been connected through internet broadband.  The contribution of India in the world  GDP was 2.6 per cent in the year 2014 which has been increased upto 3.3 per cent.   A network of highways connectivity is being developed throughout the country.   Thus, our villages, labourers, women, doctors, teachers, scientists, farmers and  youth are getting benefit through all these developmental works. In the Union Budget,  extending relief to the middle class income tax limit has been doubly enhanced to  Rs.5 lakh.  This will benefit three crore taxpayers.  This Budget comprises small  rebates in various forms and structures with a view to giving a fillip to the housing  sector.  The interests accrued on bank deposits and the one received as rent has  also been increased from the existing ceiling of Rs.10 thousand to Rs.40 thousand  in terms of TDS.  This step will enhance disposable income.  Marginal farmers  having landholding upto 2 hectare would be given Rs.6 thousand per annum under  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi.  This will benefit 12 crore farmers.  This is  in honour of marginal farmers.  Defence allocation has been enhanced by 6.87 per  cent and has been increased to Rs.3.18 lakh crore.  This apart, the veterans\\u2019 morale  has also been strengthened with the implementation of one rank one pension  scheme.  Matri Vandana scheme has been launched for the pregnant women which  will go a long way in nurturing the infant as well as edifying their health profile.   With these words, I support this Budget and earnestly hope that the people would  not leave us in bad humour. This Government has created credibility  in the political arena.  People have greatly benefitted from Ayushman Bharat  Scheme.  We have made arrangement for transferring an amount of 75000 crore  rupees annually directly to the bank accounts of farmers without involving any  intermediary.  The second thing is 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'.  There is no  discrimination on the basis of religion, class or caste.  Another aspect of 'Sabka  Saath, Sabka Vikas' is development of all the regions.  We have identified 115  backward districts and have taken care of development of these districts.  We have  ensured all round development in the North East Region.  Our Government has  provided corruption free governance.  The hon'ble Prime Minister took a bold  decision and implemented GST.  This has resulted in the expansion of our  economy.  This Government is undertaking public welfare works with the resolve  to uplift the weakest sections of the society.  I certainly believe that this  Government would get mandate of the people again.  I support the Motion of  Thanks on the President's Address. The Government under the leadership of our hon.  Prime Minister has worked to make India a strong nation.  The work done by the  Prime Minister is unmatched and no one has been able to do that in the past 70  years.  This Government has completed the schemes started by it.  In the past five  years nobody levelled charges of corruption against any Minister of the  Government.   Special relief has been provided to middle class tax payers by  raising the tax limit to five lakh rupees.  It is the first time ever that Rs. 6000 per  year would be provided to those farmers having less than 2 hectares of land.  The  Central Government has launched the  'Pradhan Mantri Bima Yojana, under which  the farmers will have to deposit 1.5 per cent premium for Rabi crop and 2 per cent  premium for kharif crop and rest of the premium would be provided by the Central  Government.  When we were in the power in Rajasthan  at the time we waived the  loans of farmers  upto Rs. 50,000.  In case of any natural calamity the farmer  would be provided rebate on loan amount upto 2 per cent and if he repays his loan  on time a rebate of  3 per cent would be given provided.  This Government has  provided free gas connections to eight crore poor families the Government has  launched the MUDRA Yojana under which 15 crore people have been granted  loans including 73 per cent women.  I come from western Rajasthan.  My  Parliamentary Constituency is Sri Ganganagar.  For the first time it has been  decided by the Government to make road along the 1060 kilometers of long border  under the Bharat Mala and the Government is spending 25,000 crore rupees on it.   The Government will construct a green corridor from Amritsar to Bhavnagar and a  sum of Rs. 25,000 crore has been allocated for it.  13 new trains have started  running under my Parliamentary Constituency.  And each and every railway  station is being renovated.  First time, the funds allocated by the 14th Finance  Commission as well as funds allocated by State Finance Commission has reached  Gram Panchayats.  Hon. Prime Minister has run a corruption free Government for  five years.  The Government has taken a pledge to build a new India by 2022.  I  would like to make a mention of the Rajasthan Canal which was constructed in  1970 and was not renovated till date and for the first time a proposal to this effect  was forwarded by the then hon. Chief Minister of Rajasthan and a sum of Rs. 3400  crore has been allocated by the Government for the purpose. I am particularly grateful to the Hon. Prime  Minister who has taken pains to release Rs.57 crore for developing the \\u2018Nirvan  Sthali\\u2019 of Kabir Saheb into a tourist destination.  Sanction has been accorded for  laying new railway lines in a small district- Sant Kabir Nagar.  With this  development, the new railway shall connect seven Parliamentary Constituencies.  The date for laying the foundation stone of this project which is likely to involve  an expenditure of Rs.5 thousand crore, is going to be fixed in the near future.   Under the campaign launched against black-money, certain strict steps such as  demonetization, Fugitive  Economic Offenders Act and laws enacted for bringing  in black-money have led to the seizure and attachment of the assets amounting to  Rs.50 thousand crore.  During this period benami properties bearing worth Rs.6900  crore and foreign assets worth Rs.1600 crore have been attached.  North Eastern  region has also been extended a host of schemes involving more than Rs.21  thousand crore.  Be it through revolution in the railways or in the field of education  or that of Ujjawala revolution, the Government has been able to translate the  dreams of those mothers and sisters who had suffered deprivation for years  together.  In the previous regime, four kilometers road used to be constructed a day  whereas 28 kilometers of road are being constructed now on daily basis.  The  railways have given a gift to the women by advertising recruitment for the 600  women. The President's Address, in fact,  reflects more of true image of Bharat than India.   I convey my sincere thanks to  H.E. President of India for honouring the farmers of the country by calling them  Anna Data.  Our Government took the historic decision to give one and half times  more price than the input cost for as many as 22 crops.  Weaker sections of the  upper caste people also got 10% reservation.  According constitutional status to the  Backward Classes Commission symbolizes this Government's commitment to the  cause of social justice.  The recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission have  also been implemented.  One Rank One Pension was also granted to all the  personnel of the Armed Forces and the largest health care scheme of the world has  also been implemented in the country.  Implementation of the GST was the biggest  economic reform undertaken after the independence.  Under the Mudra Scheme,  about 15 lakh people have been given loans and out of those given loans,  75% are  women.  Providing gas connection under the Ujjawala Scheme is also a welcome  step. I think, this Bill should have been brought  long back. But, there is no doubt that it is very good for the criminal justice system,  the civil system and more so for the people of this country.  I have one question.   Your object under Section 21 is that no DNA should be taken up without consent.   If some investigating agency or any other agency abuses that power, what steps  would be taken against that person under this law?  In a criminal case, unless  consent in writing is given, nothing can be taken and if the investigating agency  wants to take it, they have to make an application.  But how a civil dispute would  be covered?  Therefore, immigration authority will be having the excessive power  to collect the DNA which is not your object.  Then come many other cases.  In a  case of medical negligence, how will DNA come into that?  There is an issue  relating to abandoned children and disputed children.  Until a child attains 18 years  of age, can his DNA be collected?  Does it not violate. The Child Protection Rights  Act?  This Act has many laudable objectives.  So many preventive steps have been  taken.  People will be secure and things will be done properly. I would like to congratulate the  Minister for bringing this long pending Bill.  This Bill is very important.  Recently,  there was a famous case of a senior politician over the fixation of parentage.  As  you  know, the parentage was finally decided with the help of the DNA  technology. I would like to raise certain issues.  There are two clauses-clauses 21  and 23 in civil matters-which state that no consent is required.  There is no clarity  in this matter.  A civil matter comes when there is a dispute about the parentage  and a child is claimed by different people.  I think, there must be clarity with  regard to the consent in civil matters, whether consent of accused or victim is  required, what the procedure is and whether it would require a Magistrate's order.   These things need to be clarified.  In medical cases also, DNA technology is  absolutely necessary to ascertain whether negligence was there.  Now, I come to  storage of data. There is no clarity on storage of these profiles in the DNA  laboratories.    With regard to databank, we have clarity on regulatory board, but  there is no clarity on clause 31(4) with regard to data storage in a DNA lab.  I  would request the Minister to clarify this point. The common man of the country  has had been demanding for decades that if SC, ST categories have got reservation  then there should also be reservation in Government jobs for the economically  backward people of the general category.  Now this reservation will be provided  through amendment in the Article 15 and Article 16 of the Constitution. Our leader  and hon. Chief Minister of Bihar, Nitish Kumar ji has already been an advocate of  this reservation.  Economically backward people of general category of all  religions shall be given 10 per cent reservation in the jobs and educational  institutions.  This is an example of implementation of Modiji\\u2019s philosophy of  \\u2018Sab  Ka Sath, Sab Ka Vikas\\u2019.  This proposal of giving reservation to economically  backward people of general category was also brought during the time of Narsimha  Rao ji but then it was declared unconstitutional.  Today, I am hopeful that our  colleagues from Congress will also welcome this Bill.  I support this Bill. A Constitution (Amendment) Bill  has been moved as a special agenda. Attempts have been made to identify the  economically weaker section of the society, and provide them and support them  with affirmative action. Not only the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes are poor,  backward classes are poor, but people who are from general category are also poor  who are in need of education, in need of services, in need of employment. The  economically weaker section of society needs to be identified and they should be  provided affirmative support. For the first time in the history of our democratic  republic, economically weaker sections of citizens are being provided the benefit  through affirmative action. Clauses 4 and 5 of Article 15, and clause 4 of Article  16 provide reservation for people as per caste.  But here, as per their economic  status, reservation is going to be provided both in services as well as in  employment. The economic criterion needs adequate reformation every ten years.  A poor is a poor and he needs all sorts of support from the Government and also  from society. The poor have to be identified and the poor have to be provided with  all sorts of affirmative support from the Government and that is what is required.  The identification of the beneficiary would be on economic criteria and that needs  to be upgraded invariably in a time period. The State Government will determine  about the economically weaker category.  I support this Bill. Our Party will support  this Bill. I rise to speak in support of 124th  Amendment Bill of the Constitution. We will provide opportunity to the weaker  section of society i.e. the poor to move forward under Article 46 of the Directive  Principles of State Policy.  It is a historical step after the journey of 72 years of  independence.  Hon. Modiji is worthy of congratulation for this.  He should also be  congratulated for executing the work of providing this reservation without  tampering the reservation given to other Backward Castes, Scheduled Castes and  Scheduled Tribes.  When the Government of Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee came to  power, the place of development in the country increased rapidly during those six  years.  When the Government of Modiji came to power, the pace of development  increased four fold on all fronts and a lot of avenues for jobs are being made  available.  There is a large section in general category also which needs some  support.  The welfare of the poor from general category should also be taken into  concern.  The Government has given the benefit of reservation to the poor general  category without reducing anyone's reservation even by one per cent.  Such poor  can be from any castes of general category.  Only the coalition Government of  NDA can take big steps here. Today, the Government which is committed towards  the poor in the country has once again proved that it is committed for the welfare  of Dalit, backward and poor of upper castes with full dedication. Today is a big historic day.  Today Modi ji  has taken a historic step to provide reservation to those castes among SC, ST, OBC  and forward classes who were not covered earlier for this purpose.  No  Government provided legitimate power to OBC's but Modi Government.  After 70  years of independence there was grudge among forward classes against SC, ST and  OBC reservation and protests were being organized against reservation.  Now this  step has put a complete check on said protests.  It is indeed 'Sabka Saath Sabka  Vikas'.  All citizens of the country who are facing injustice would be very happy  with this decision.  Our civilization and culture is above caste system but due to  wrong policies castes have been divided.  Hon'ble Modi ji and the Government has  brought this Bill to end the bane of poverty.  I support this Bill and urge upon all  the parties to do so. History is being created today in this  august House.  The Constitution (124th Amendment) Bill providing 10 per cent  reservation is going to pave the way for the prosperity of the children of the poor  from general category.  The poor people of the general category were deprived of  Government jobs for want of  reservation for them.  Moreover, they were deprived  of getting admission to the higher institutions of education.  But such a significant  decision taken by the Government has sent a message among the people of general  category that this Government takes care of everybody.  At the same time, the  existing system of reservation has not been tinkered with.  People from all the  religions have been covered under the ambit of this 10 per cent reservation. This is a good decision to provide 10%  reservation to the economically weaker sections of general category.  I used to  demand time and again that economically weaker sections of general category  should also get reservation.  Members from the opposition are saying that today is  the last day.  What difference does it make?  After all the Bill has been introduced.   They used to interrupt the proceedings of the House due to which this delay  happened.  Baba Saheb Ambedkar wanted to have equality in the society.  That is  why hon. Prime Minister has given the slogan, 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'.  My  party, the Republican Party supports this Bill. The dream as well as the cause I  have been cherishing and fighting for all through my life has been translated into  reality today.   'Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas' has been the primordial plank and the  basic guiding principle of this Government.  All the schemes piloted by this  Government are aimed at ameliorating the status of the poor, those living in  cottages and the destitute.  Today a Bill for the reservation of the poor and the  helpless belonging to upper castes has come up and I support the Bill.  Alongside, I  would urge upon crores of youth of the country to wake up and  welcome the new  sun of development that has appeared on the horizon and of course I would take  this opportunity to egg on them to take the society forward driven by inclusive  spirit. As per the prevalent situation today,  it is an outdated impression that leprosy cannot be cured and therefore, it will be a   cause for divorce.  So, this Bill seeks to amend various Acts.  But nowadays, with  modern medicines, leprosy is curable.  I fully support the amendments that have  been moved in this Bill. The opposition sought a discussion  on an important issue and we expressed our willingness to hold a discussion.  But  the Congress Party took more than 20 days to prepare itself for this discussion.   The national security is not paramount for them.  This Government enters into   defence agreements keeping national interest in mind.  In fact, in their regime no  defence deal would be completed without a \\u2018deal\\u2019 involved in it.  There is a long  list of scams perpetrated by them, be it Bofors,  Submarine, Augusta Westland,  National Herald case.  All these scams took place to arrange political funding for  the Congress Party.  Now the Supreme Court\\u2019s decision has come and it is a  victory for our Armed Forces, of truth and that of the Government and at the same  time this is a serious setback to the Congress Party.  The Supreme Court has stated  in detail that they looked into the pricing, procedure and the offset clause and  found that there was no commercial favouratism.  This also proves that this  Government has strengthened the Armed Forces, and took this decision in the  larger national interest.  The Congress Party must know that they could not take a  decision in this regard for ten long years and now they raise the issue relating to  the Rafale.  Finally, this deal has been completed by our Government.  Had your  Government clinched this deal, then our Government would not have at all  required to procure these aircraft.  I would like to ask as to why the name of one  family crops up repeatedly in defence deals.  Today, our Armed Forces are happy,  the Government is happy and the people of the country are also happy.  The  decision of the Hon. Supreme Court has established the truth in clear terms. The Government has completed the  deal for procurement of 36 Rafale aircraft with the Dassault Aviation in a  transparent manner.   Our Government has completed this deal in a minimum  possible time, though this deal was pending for ten long years. The opposition is  constantly raising the issue of corruption in this deal.  The Congress party has lost  its faith in Hon. Supreme Court.  When the Supreme Court stated that there was no  violation of rules in this deal, still this Government is being targeted for gaining  some political mileage only.  The Air Force of the country has also stated that this  fighter aircraft is good for the defence of the country.  Only issue is that of offset  contract.  The French Government and the Dassault Aviation have categorically  stated that there was no pressure from the Government of India in this regard.  The  HAL has also stated that they were not in a position to manufacture Rafale.  Our  Air Force is going to receive 36 Rafale aircraft and our Air Force personnel are  happy about it. The present Aadhaar Bill has some  amendments proposed in the backdrop of the Supreme Court judgement and seeks  to address the issues of privacy and probity.  The Hon. Minister has made it clear  that no person shall be denied the benefits of the social welfare schemes in the  absence of the Aadhaar.  The Government has done many such things which have  given solid base for the Aadhaar.  Two or three provisions of the present Bill  are  especially made to remove the earlier discrepancies.  Earlier, some people were  looting the benefits meant for the poor.  Now the Aadhaar has eliminated those  people and the schemes are being implemented smoothly.  The Government has  saved Rs. 90,000 crore by linking schemes with Aadhaar.  This amount would  prove to be a relief to the poor.\",\n          \"I stand against this Motion. I wonder how  Lok Sabha can speak in different voices. The Lok Sabha should speak in one voice.  Is this Government a Government of one community or one religion or is it the  Government of the people of all religions of the country? I believe this country has  no religion. I respect Maryada Purushottam Ram. Today, India's 17 crore Muslims  are taking themselves to be  strangers and alienated. I will never believe in false and  deceitful things now and will  continue to work within the ambit of the Constitution.  When the Prime Minister replies, will he speak for 140 crore people of India or will  he reply only to  those who care about Hindutva? Let me stand as a tall Indian  Muslim and say that the light of Indian democracy is at its dimmest today.   I would like to highlight the status of  the Indian economy since the pre-Independence era. After we got our Independence  in 1947 from British rule, India\\u2019s GDP was only about one per cent of the world\\u2019s  GDP. Our Government at that time faced the biggest challenge of nation-building.  Many things had to be taken care of. Poverty was the biggest threat to our nation at  that point in time. The Green Revolution and White Revolution were focused upon  to improve agricultural production and milk production. In 1991, the economy of the  country opened up and improved under the capable leadership of the then Prime  Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao and the Finance Minister Dr Manmohan Singh.  After assuming office, our Hon. Prime Minister promised that two crore jobs would  be offered to people every year and that the prices of gas and petrol would be halved.  Adding further it was also claimed that the exchange rate of the US dollar would be  reduced but even after ten years today there is no mention of these things in the  White Paper presented  by the Government. It does not find mention of  demonetization, its effects and achievements. All the opposition parties have been  asking for the same. The whole exercise of demonetization seems futile as there is  no mention of the same. This Government has only increased the cess throughout  the country since 2014. Over the last two years, the Government has imposed  windfall tax on oil companies. This windfall tax is for making excessive profits and  it has been informed that the cost of petrol and diesel is now market-driven and not  under their control. The Government claims to have alleviated 25 crore people out  of poverty but it is far from the truth. During the COVID period, eighty crore people  had to be provided free rations which is something commendable. Now after that  pandemic is over, the same promise has been repeated for the next five years. The  dependence of 80 crore people, which accounts for  55 per cent of the country's  population, on free ration for sustenance is a sad state of affairs. With reference to  the scams highlighted by the Hon. Minister, I would like to ask the Government why  no action had been taken by the present Government during their rule for ten years.  The Government is only interested in making accusations against the Opposition. A  Commission should have been set up to inquire into the CAG report to bring out the  truth.  Our party is of the opinion that before the next  Lok Sabha general elections, the game of making serious allegations and counter- allegations and proving each other wrong and anti-people by issuing black papers  and white papers between the Congress Party and the BJP is nothing but selfishness.  How can the country, public interest and public welfare be possible through such  narrow politics? Today, crores of people of the country are constantly suffering from  stressful life due to high inflation, immense poverty, unemployment, plight of  farmers and plight of rural India etc. It is very important for all political parties to  give up selfishness and hatred etc. and make a united effort on the most pressing  national problems of the country. The correct assessment of the policy and activities  of every Government depends on the better livelihood of the people and their  happiness and happy life. The record of both the Congress and BJP Governments in  this matter is neither remarkable nor commendable. If the record of UPA's 10-year  tenure had been excellent then BJP would not have got a chance to come to power  in the country. Similarly, if the tenure of the present Government in the last 10 years  had been excellent in terms of public interest, public welfare, national interest, social  and religious harmony, peace and order etc., then crores of people would  have  never  been so troubled and miserable in every sphere of life. Lack of expected  increase in the per capita income of the people of the country, big capitalists  becoming more prosperous, SC, ST and OBC reservations being made inactive and  ineffective and no significant reduction in corruption in common life, are some of  the issues for public interest. There are specific issues which continue to disturb  people and which are diverting the country from its ambitious objective of equitable  and welfare development. It would have been good if the development of the  country's economy had been employment-oriented rather than employment-free and  the benefits of this development would have been available to all sections of the  society. I demand that the way you have honoured Karpoori Thakur ji with Bharat  Ratna, in the same way if you honour Shri Kanshi Ram with Bharat Ratna then crores  of Dalits, backward classes, Muslims, people of all sections of the society will  be  happy. This white paper is not a white paper but an  election stunt. This is an attempt to hide all the failures of the government. It is  regrettable that the order for the release of a drug-related criminal in Manipur comes  from the Chief Minister's office. Another report came regarding the Ayushman  Bharat scheme as to what kind of corruption is happening in Ayushman Bharat  today. The audit noted that around 7.5 lakh beneficiaries were registered against the  same mobile number and no verification was done. Claims are being filed in the  name of 90 thousand people who have died. No action is being taken on that. Today  ED has become another arm of BJP. ED's job is to catch the corrupt. But today ED  is their special weapon to suppress democracy and the voice of opposition and how  to include corrupt people in the BJP. Had they allowed ED to work, it would have  caught all the people who have absconded abroad today. There are about 31 people  abroad who owe a debt of Rs 40 thousand crore, but today ED is not  apprehending them. If the Prime Minister is so powerful in the world then why does  he not bring back these people hiding abroad? The average GDP growth in UPA was 6.8  per cent whereas the average GDP growth in this Government has reached to 5.9 per  cent. The Fiscal Deficit as a Percentage of GDP was 4.7 percent during the tenure of  UPA whereas during this Government, it remained 5.1 percent average. Inflation  was 8 percent in the UPA Government whereas, it was 5 percent in this Government,  but is it not true that the global oil prices between 2008 and 2014 were more than  100 dollars per barrel, while the prices of oil between 2015 to 2021 were in the range  of $ 55 and $ 70. If GDP was 5.9 percent during the NDA regime, then what about  the rate of unemployment? Why has the Prime Minister not undertaken an  employment survey since 2011? The consumption survey has not been conducted  since 2017. The dollar was at Rs 43 during the year 2005, while it reached to Rs 83  during 2014. How did it reach to $ 83? There is a net increase of 40 rupees. The  foreign currency reserve was at $ 294 billion in 2011. By the year 2013, it rose to  256 billion. Health expenditure from pocket which was 69 percent in the year 2005  has increased to 64.2 percent in the year 2014. In the White Paper at least you give  the data for the year 2020. This white paper is more rhetoric than substantive. Make  a White Paper showing the number of Muslims including Akhlaq who were mob  lynched during the years 2014 to 2024. How many houses were demolished by  bulldozers? Finally, during the UPA regime, there was provision of free coaching in  minorities budget, which they have stopped. They closed the Maulana Azad  Foundation, they stopped the Maulana Azad Fellowship. They have abolished  Madrasa education. During 2014 there was a Muslim Minister, now there is none. This White Paper was a  comparison of two Government tenures of a decade of each. There was nothing but  allegations against the previous Government.  This White Paper is not a White Paper.  It is a politically coloured paper. The unemployment rate during UPA was 2.2 per  cent, while during the present Government, it is 6.6. per cent. The average GDP  growth rate during the previous Government was 8.13 percent which is 5.6 percent  now. Regarding the fiscal deficit data, if you take the entire tenures together, the  fiscal deficit during Dr. Manmohan Singh Ji\\u2019s Government was 4.48 percent while  during this  Government it was 5.8 per cent. Jan Dhan was a product which was  started earlier and there were 34 crore bank accounts. Eventually, they took it to 51  crore accounts which is not a great achievement. Average expenditure during the  UPA Government was 14.68 per cent of the GDP while during this Government it  was 12.94 per cent. They always say that spending has gone up which is not the case.  Be it education and health care during the earlier Government, if you comparatively  take the cumulative figure, the budget outlay of the whole year, the spending on  health care and education is much lesser now than it used to be before. They have  started a cashless economy that they wanted to and they have started a digital  economy. In the digital sphere, you know what has happened to Paytm. It is almost  like money laundering through Paytm. So, what is the Government doing for the  economy? There is a Bhim app now. The Bhim app is hardly used by people. The  IT Committee report has already flagged this. So, these are very serious concerns.  Let us do something constructive and serve this nation.  This is a white paper related to the dark  clouds that have been hovering around the country for ten years and there is no  mention of demonetization, the loss of the economy, the foreign policy of the  country, China's continuous intrusion inside the country, the misuse of ED in it. In  the tribal-dominated state of Jharkhand, an attempt was made to forcibly bring down  a tribal Chief Minister. Executive, Income Tax, CBI, and ED have been grossly  misused in ten years. They have failed to meet the promises they made before 2014.  They are ending the reservation given to SC, ST, and OBC in lieu of atrocities done  on them for thousands of years through privatization. The Government is  manipulating to award of contracts, tenders etc to their favourites and they are calling  themselves corruption-free. The Government is running because of ED, CBI and  Income Tax, otherwise, they do not have the strength to fight with any party. This Amendment law brought in the House is  regarding water pollution. If we talk about air pollution, then India is also included in  the world's 10 most toxic cities, wherein even breathing is risking life. Among the 122  countries across the world where water pollution is a sensitive issue, India ranks 120  out of 122 countries. Even in Assam, our Central Pollution Control Board has  mentioned that out of 10 rivers, there are 11 very polluted stretches. untreated waste,  whether from industry or our homes, is getting dumped into our rivers every day. You  have spent around Rs 12,000 crore on 'Namami Gange'. There are many tanneries,  chemical industries, slaughterhouses, textile industries, etc. on the banks of the  Mother Ganga River. These industries also want to clean up their industry emissions  and for that, they need support that includes funds, credits and technology. Will the  Central Government provide assistance to such small and medium-scale industries? At  the same time, I also would like to ask the Government that how vigilantly it will  monitor the big industries regarding water pollution. We are neither making any rules  nor listing categories. We demand that more details should be included in the bill. We  would like to ask why there is no mention of the State Government in this Bill. If you  want to exempt, do so, if you want to issue a gazette notification then do so, but do so  after consultation with the state government. Today, in our country, due to ever  increasing population, further urbanization will also take place. Keeping this problem  in mind, you should have brought a strong law and not the feeble one that you are  bringing. I rise here to speak on the Interim Budget  2024-25. Since 2014, we all have been listening to \\u2018Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas\\u2019. I want  to ask one thing to the hon. Finance Minister. Whose \\u2018Vikas\\u2019 are you talking about?   Let me be very clear that you are not definitely talking about the \\u2018Vikas\\u2019 of the  farmers.  In this Budget, under major Union schemes, funds for the Formation and  Promotion of 10,000 Farmer Producer Organisations have been slashed by 39 per  cent. The Finance Minister talked about Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana in her  speech but ended up reducing the amount for this scheme by 21 per cent as compared  to the last year.  In West Bengal, the Chief Minister has tripled the farmers\\u2019 income. I  will remind the Finance Minister about the funds which are still due to the State of  West Bengal. Funds for the Regional Connectivity Scheme, AMRUT Scheme, and  Smart City Mission have been slashed by 60 per cent to 35 per cent. In the Ministry of  Civil Aviation, funds have been slashed to 26 per cent.  We used to buy rice and  wheat at Rs. 24 per kg and 15 per kg. Now it is Rs. 42 per kg and 28 per kg  respectively. There is a BJP Government in 80 percent of states but there are no  women Chief Minister or Women Finance Minister in any of them.  ADV. A. M. ARIFF:  Before going into the details of the Budget, I would  like to ask a few pertinent questions about the claims that India will become the third  largest economy in the world soon and our economic growth will be 7.5 per cent in  2023-24. Why is the vibrant growth claimed not by the Government reflected in the  lives of the common people of this country?  The common people are made to suffer  by the increase in the prices of cooking gas as well as essential commodities.  The  price of subsidized domestic LPG cylinders has increased to Rs. 1000.  The petrol  prices are the highest in the world while five per cent own more than 60 per cent of  the country\\u2019s wealth, the bottom 50 per cent possess only three per cent. I would like  to raise a pertinent issue regarding neglect towards the non-BJP-ruled States of the  country including Kerala. Karnataka, Kerala, Telangana and Tamil Nadu States are  suffering at the hands of the Union Government. Instead of supporting the State  Governments by giving their due share, the Government is squeezing them. The  devolution of Central taxes has been drastically reduced from 3.875 per cent to 1.9 per  cent. The Hon'ble Finance Minister in her Budget  Speech has just made a blank hypothesis of  social justice as inclusive, all-embracing  and all-inclusive, which implies that   development  covers people belonging to  all  spheres of life.  Universalisation  of education in  the entire society in a  country  is  important for the all-round development of a nation.  In the field of  education,  the seats reserved for the students  belonging to SC / ST and OBC in Kashi  Hindu University  have not been filled by the candidates of those categories by just  putting the tag of an NFS (not found suitable) in these categories and filling  these  vacancies with the candidates of the general category shows hollowness of the  meaningful initiatives taken by the present government in the interests of SC / ST and  OBC students coming under reservation.  About 10 lakh posts are vacant in central  government ministries and departments. The government should provide employment  to the unemployed by taking measures to fill the vacant posts at the earliest. The target  of self-reliant India will be achieved  only when 80 crore countrymen, who are being  provided ration by the government, will get proper employment and jobs.  I request  the government to provide housing to the landless by allotting leases of government  land at the level of Municipal Corporation, Nagar Palika, Nagar Panchayat and Gram  Panchayat so that homeless people can also get houses.  Anganwadi workers/helpers  should be given the status full of  government employees. The central government is  repeatedly ignoring the interests of farmers. I would like to draw attention to the toll  plazas situated on the National Highway and State Highways in my  district and Lok  Sabha constituency,  Bijnor, that toll is already proposed on NH-34 for traffic going  from Najibabad to  Bijnor.  Traffic from Bijnor to Dhampur via NH-734 and NH-709  AD, is already toll  being collected between Kotwali to Dhampur. This  is a two-lane  road used predominantly  by the farmers and local residents of the area. As per the  NHAI policy, all local residents within a radius of 10 km are exempted from toll  charges. Then why the government is still wasting money on the construction of a toll  plaza between Bijnor Kotwali Road? Therefore, I request  to kindly stop the  construction of the toll plaza being built between Bijnor to Kotwali without delay in  the interest of farmers and local residents. The Finance Minister discussed  agriculture and food processing, emphasising the intensified efforts for value addition  to the agricultural sector and raising farmers\\u2019 income. However, the upcoming year's  allocation for this scheme is only Rs 729 crore, marking a 21 percent decrease against  last year's Budget estimates. The Government should consider increasing the financial  assistance allocated to this pivotal scheme. I request the Central Government not to  reduce the allocation of fertilizers for coastal regions that have suffered the brunt of  the cyclones. The Labour Ministry has seen a decreased allocation from Rs. 13,221.73  crore to Rs. 12,531.47 crore. Unemployment is the biggest harm facing the youth of  today. Significant investment needs to be made for employment generation. The  Budgetary allocation of Rs 538 crore for the Centre's Capacity Building and Skill  Development scheme does not seem adequate. Application of Artificial Intelligence is  on the rise, and unfortunately, it is being weaponized against women. It is regrettably  being done via deep fakes, among other reprehensible acts. Higher budgetary  allocation is required to deal with such new threats. The Andhra Pradesh Government  has consistently sought an increase in MGNREGA man-days, proposing an  augmentation from 100 to 150 days for individuals and a total of 16 crore man-days.  Given the prevailing drought conditions leading to rural migration, the State urges the  Central Government to support its economy by enhancing MGNREGA man-hours  and incorporating new initiatives under the scheme. I urge the Government to  formulate and implement a time-bound plan for granting special category status to  Andhra Pradesh promptly, providing the necessary support to address the unfair losses  incurred due to illogical bifurcation. The Polavaram Irrigation Project is a project of  national importance and it is of huge importance for the people of Andhra Pradesh.  The total cost of the project is Rs.55,548.87 crores at the 2017-18 price level as  approved by the Technical Advisory Committee. However, this Revised Cost  Estimate is not yet approved by the Central Government. Further, funding for Phase-1  completion has been limited to Rs.12,911.15 crore but this amount is inadequate for  providing rehabilitation and resettlement to the 36 additional villages and 48  habitations. Hence, the Andhra Pradesh Government submitted a proposal of Revised  Cost Estimates of Rs.17,144.06 crore for Phase-1 of the project which includes the  cost of such rehabilitation as well. It is requested that the Revised Cost Estimate be  approved by the Technical Advisory Committee and the Revised Cost Estimate for  Phase-1 and provide compensation of  the additional cost of Rs.4222.91 crore incurred  by the Andhra Pradesh Government for resettlement and rehabilitation. Production  activities in all NTC mills were suspended from March 2020 due to the COVID-19  pandemic. The Central Government should take immediate action to make the NTC  mill in Tirupati fully functional to provide relief and support to the BPL families  through its operations. In the Rajya Sabha recently, the Hon. Education  Minister said that 32 thousand students dropped out of higher education midway, out  of which 52 percent of students belong to the SC, ST and OBC categories. It is a very  serious matter. I demand that Dalit, exploited, backward and vulnerable people may  be enrolled on zero balance and efforts need to be taken to educate them. According to  the statement of the present Government, lakhs of youth have been offered  Government jobs in mission mode, but it has remained just an election Jumla. Nearly  10 lakh posts are lying vacant in the Union Ministries and Departments. As on March  1, 2021, only 30.55 lakh employees are working against 40.35 lakh sanctioned posts.  The Government should take measures to fill these vacancies at the earliest and  provide employment to the unemployed. The Government says that arrangements  have been made to provide free ration to 80 crore countrymen. If you work to give  free ration to 80 crore people in this country,  it shows the scale of  unemployment in  our country. You are not giving employment to a poor person, but you are doing the  work of giving ration to him/her. If the Government talks about making an Atma  Nirbhar Bharat,  provide a Government job to the families of these 80 crore people  based on  their qualifications. The Government introduced the Pradhan  Mantri Awas  Yojana. If the Government  wants to make this scheme a reality, landless people ought  to be given  residential leases on  the Government owned land in the Municipal  Corporation, Nagar Palika, and Nagar Panchayats, and work on making them part of  the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. There is also a mention of women empowerment.  In this context, I would like to say that 44,5256 cases related to atrocities against  women have been registered in the year 2022,  meaning thereby  about 51 FIRs per  hour. This makes us think that the Government has failed to protect women. The  Government has arranged Ayushman cards for Anganwadi workers. It is a good  initiative of the Government but their honorarium is very low.  By affording them the  status of Government servants, the Government can certainly offer them a dignified  life. The Government repeatedly ignores the interests of the farmers. According to the  recent NCRB data, the highest numbers of 12,227 suicides have been committed by  farmers and agricultural workers in Maharashtra, due to loss of crops, loss of land and    non-repayment of loans, etc. Therefore, it is very sad and concerning to ignore the  lives of the people reeling under poverty, unemployment, inflation, etc. I would like to  draw your attention to the toll plazas situated on the National Highway in Bijnor and  Nagina parliamentary constituency in my home district. A free toll is already proposed  for vehicles plying from Bijnor via NH-34. It is a two-lane road used by farmers and  local residents of the area. No commercial vehicle passes through this road. According  to the NHAI, all local residents within a radius of 10 km have been exempted from  toll, yet why is the government wasting money on the construction of a toll plaza  between Bijnor and Kotwali Road? I request you to kindly stop the construction of the  toll plaza between Bijnor and Kotwali. By using new words and  technologies, our Finance Minister has presented this confusing and misleading  budget, which is a gimmick in itself. It has been mentioned that the Government is  providing food grains free of cost to 80 crore people in this country. It means the  Finance Minister has accepted that 80 crore people are still living below the poverty  line. A few years ago, the Finance Minister mentioned that we are going to become a  five trillion dollar economy very soon. I do not know whether we have achieved that  target or not. The Finance Minister has mentioned that our total tax collection has  increased threefold during these years. Then why are people still languishing in abject  poverty? The MUDRA scheme was launched and our young boys and girls  approached banks to get the benefits of this scheme. But later the banks stopped  providing MUDRA loans to the poor and needy youths of this country. We often talk  about 'Annadaata', our farmers. However, we do not take any initiative to ensure MSP  for farmers. In my state Maharashtra, our soybean, cotton and pigeon pea-growing  farmers are distressed and they are not getting remunerative prices any more. The  export of soybeans is banned by the Government and they are importing it. So, all the  soybean, cotton etc. producing farmers are facing acute problems. I would like to  request the Union Government to fix MSP. To ensure tele-connectivity and also to  improve the telecommunication network, around 25000 4G towers had to be installed.  But it has not been installed till date in my constituency. Konkan Railway is our pride  and honour. It connects North India with South India. Konkan Railway is a  Government company. I would request the Union Government to dissolve the Konkan  Railway Corporation and acquire it as early as possible. Our per capita income is lesser than in  Bangladesh and Bhutan. Whereas in the case of states per capita income, Bihar is at  the last position.  The Government is targeting minorities and not taking care of the  well-being of Bihar. In the budget, educational schemes such as Skills development  and livelihood programmes are being pulled back. In AMU Kishanganj neither  teaching nor non-teaching staff is inducted nor are funds released.  My demand is to  stop the linking of Kosi and Mechi in the Mahananda basin. Border pitching and  concrete walls should be constructed on them and every year dredging should be done  to check floods. A Government medical college should be allotted to our district.  The  most backward community Surjapuri should be included in the OBC list. A train  should be started for Kishanganj and Seemanchal and attention should be paid to job  opportunities in this region. You claim that you have lifted 25 crore  people above the poverty line. You were giving free ration to 80 crore people, and you  have lifted 25 crore people above the poverty line. In this way, you are assuming that  105 crore people were poor within ten years. This is your achievement of ten years.  You promised that by March 2022, every homeless person in this country will get a  house and not only a house, there will be a tap in the house and there will be water in  the tap, but work on a single house has not even been started. You reduced the budget  of minorities by 38 percent. You have reduced the budget of madrasas. You have  reduced the pre-matric scholarship. You want Children of minorities, especially of  Muslims, should only set up tea stalls, make punctures, and drive auto rickshaws.  ASHA workers and Anganwadi workers agitate every few months. Those ASHA  workers get seven thousand rupees. Even after working hard, Anganwadi workers get  15 thousand rupees. The loans of big industrialists have been written off by the banks.  There are 3,330 government schools in my constituency Aurangabad which do not  have pucca roofs and these children study under tin sheds.  \\uf02aSHRI SUNIL DATTATRAY TATKARE: Under the able leadership of the  Prime Minister, this new Parliament Building has been constructed. Being a part of  NDA, today I rise to support and appreciate this Interim Budget. Our Prime Minister  performed wonderfully during the last ten years and that has helped to build  confidence and trust. Shrimati Nirmala Sitaraman ji has presented a very balanced and  progressive budget. Our government is focusing on infrastructure development and we  have constructed a 22 km long Setu. This coastal road infrastructure would also help  to connect the Agardanda-Turmadi, Vela-Diveagar, and Baghlan sea bridges too in  future. Through the Khelo India scheme, our government has promoted sports and  sportspersons in our country. Our economy is also growing at a fast pace and we are  one of the largest economies in the world. Through cooperative federalism, we are  moving forward and supporting our Maharashtra State. I am hopeful that Janjira Fort,  constructed by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, will be spared by the Archaeological  Survey of India and new development works will be carried out by our Government  by providing more funds. Under the leadership of Shri Eknath Shinde, we would be  there to support this Government and will carry forward the rich and varied heritage of  our Maharashtra for its overall development. I am hopeful that the Government will  definitely take steps to develop the 720 km long coastline of Maharashtra and bring  positive changes in the lives of fishermen.    This government has disappointed on  every front in the interim budget 2024-25. Input costs are increasing due to inflation,  and farmers' incomes are decreasing. The government has still not listened to the  demands of the farmers which shows that the government is not sensitive towards the  condition of farmers in the country. There is not even a single serious step taken by  the government to bring black money.  The government should bring a white paper on  the steps taken by the government to bring back black money. The budget fails to  address measures to check inflation and generate employment. It clearly reflects that  the slogan of \\\"Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas\\\" is a mirage for the marginalized groups in  the country. The unemployment rate is as high as 20% in a few states.  The  government is not concerned about the issues of the youth of the country. There is  nothing in this budget for the salaried middle class.  They don't even consider the  impact of household inflation and price rise on them. Rubber producers in Kerala are  not receiving adequate compensation for their products compared to the cost of  production.  I strongly urge the government to establish a minimum price of Rs 250  per kilogram for rubber. Compounded rubber (CR) will continue to be imported at nil  duty from ASEAN countries. There was not a word in the budget on the government's  intention to legalise minimum support price (MSP) or on providing guaranteed  income to farmers. The budget has nothing concrete about alternative energy, despite  the skyrocketing prices of CNG, petrol and diesel. This Government is adamant  enough not to provide any sort of financial relief to the common people. Viksit Bharat  is nothing but an amorphic idea being propagated by this government. The concept of  GeM is exorbitantly costly. On the Gem portal, the applicant or the aspirant has to pay  0.5 percent of the contracted amount. Due to the suspension of recruitment  notifications, the future of youths in the country is uncertain. I oppose the  government's Agniveer scheme. Agniveer will not get the status of martyr, he will not  get the pension, he will not get gratuity. They will not get any other facilities. The  total FDI inflow declined to 7.8 percent in the second quarter of 2023. Over 90  percent of the investment has been directed towards non-manufacturing sectors  despite the 'Make in India' initiative. The CAG reports have declared that this  Government is a failure in every sector. Flight delays persist as a prevalent issue in the  country, affecting air travel reliability. Jute producers operating in the country do not  get minimum support prices because procurement is not done. This golden fibre  should be promoted. The problem of erosion by rivers in my constituency should be  controlled by the centre and the state jointly.  THE MINISTRY OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE A paltry allocation has been made for the  Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) in the interim Union Budget 2024- 25, which is a matter of concern. The total allocation for the welfare of the SCs is Rs  1,65,598 crore and for the STs, Rs 1,21,023 crore; whereas, the total estimated  expenditure in the budget is Rs 51,08,780 crore. The funds under Pradhan Mantri Adi  Adarsh Gram Yojana were released for less than 40 percent of approved villages. This  results in setbacks to the scheme's objectives due to limited fund releases. The  allocation towards Venture capital for Dalits has been drastically reduced from Rs 70  crore to Rs 10 crore. Dalits, women and other marginalised sections of the society had  to face a strong wave of atrocities against them across the country.  It is evident that  allocations for crucial schemes related to skill development and livelihoods, as well as  the educational and social upliftment of minorities, have been reduced this time. In the  year 2023-24, the education scheme for madrasas and minorities was reduced by 93  per cent to Rs 10 crore as compared to the previous year. This time, it has been further  reduced to a mere Rs 2 crore. This time, the budget for the pre-matric scholarship for  minorities has been reduced to 326.16 crores. Further reductions in the funds and the  closure of many such schemes will be detrimental to the minorities in India. This  would harshly affect the participation and enrolment of students belonging to the  minority community, particularly girls and women. The actual disbursement of  incentives for LSEM PLI turned out to be only Rs 1,655 crore. The incentives  disbursed in the first two years amount to less than 2 percent of the total scheme  outlay. The current Government is talking about the  four strong pillars of developed India which are youth, women, farmers and poor  people but today, the youths of the country are unemployed. The youths is very  disappointed. MSME enterprises which are capable of providing employment are also  continuously declining. The people who are capable of providing employment are  leaving the country due to tax terrorism. Violence against women is continuously  increasing. India has the highest number of cases of wasting and stunting in babies.  Farmers are not being provided subsidies. Be it vegetables, milk, cylinder or petrol,  inflation is increasing. The Government is talking about IITs, Triple IITs, Universities  and AIIMS. AIIMS buildings are ready in Raebareli and Gorakhpur. But, the  Government is not capable of providing staff and equipment to the said AIIMS. This is fully an electoral budget. This  country has the highest taxation system and despite that, no social security efforts  have been made. Attempts have been made to plunge the country into debt with false  promises. The Government neither provided employment, petrol, or diesel nor  reduced the inflation but they burdened each person with the debt of more than one  lakh rupees. I think this budget is a non-sequitur. The  capitalists, the industrialists and the richer people will be happy in this budget. The  poor, the middle-class people, the farmers and labourers will fail to get rid of their  economic problems. There is no mention of unemployment and price hikes. The fund  of Awas Yojna has been stopped only for West Bengal. The money of different  central schemes is not given to West Bengal. On the other hand, the Hon\\u2019ble Chief  Minister of West Bengal has declared to give the wages of 21 lakhs 100 days workers  by 21st February 2024. I am protesting this budget because it is meaningless to the  poor and middle-class people. I stand to speak in support of  the Constitution (Jammu and Kashmir) Scheduled Castes Order (Amendment) Bill,  2023 and the Constitution (Jammu and Kashmir) Scheduled Tribes Order  (Amendment) Bill, 2023. In Maharashtra, farmers' agitation for loan waiver and  Maratha reservation is going on. The Bharatiya Janata Party had promised  reservation to the Dhangar community 10 years ago. The Lingayat Samaj, Muslim  Samaj, Bhamta, Ramoshi, Takari and those who are VJNTs want to be included  under ST. There was also a demand for reservation for Dhangar and Lingayat  communities from the state of Karnataka. If an inclusive Bill is brought for the  entire country, then every State will get justice. The Constitution (Jammu and  Kashmir) Scheduled Castes Order (Amendment) Bill, 2023 amends the  Constitution (Jammu and Kashmir) Scheduled Castes Order, 1956. The Order lists  the castes deemed to be Scheduled Castes in the Union Territories of Jammu and  Kashmir and Ladakh. The Constitution (Jammu and Kashmir) Scheduled Tribes  Order (Amendment) Bill, 2023 amends the Constitution (Jammu and Kashmir)  Scheduled Tribes Order, 1989 to create a separate list for Scheduled Tribes for  Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.  The two Bills are clubbed  together.After abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A, the people of Ladakh thought  that they would get justice. Today the people of Ladakh are demanding statehood  and inclusion in the Sixth Schedule. In 2003, our Union Ministry constituted a  High Power Committee with the objective of ensuring the protection of land and  employment for the people of Ladakh. But the people of Ladakh are still deprived  of this. I would request that the Government should also think about Ladakh and  the Gorkha people living in Darjeeling, West Bengal should also be brought under  the purview of the Sixth Schedule.    THE MINISTER OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT The Public Examinations (Prevention of  Unfair Means) Bill, 2024, has brought different stages and \\u2018unfair means\\u2019 has been  categorised under clause 3 of the Bill. All these categories are already covered by  the Indian Penal Code and Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 also which has been  passed but has not yet been implemented. There is no deficiency of laws to cover  these criminal activities, but the problem is the implementation. That is the greatest  failure in our country today. I am not objecting to anything, but still, I am saying  that all the activities are already covered. Existing laws are there. You are further  categorising it, making a sub-category, but in a broader sense, it all exists. Our  young generation is honest.  Our young generation will develop our country.  We  believe and we have trust.  But if there is one or there are two persons, segregate it,  please.   For the commitment of a criminal activity by one or two persons, the rest  should not suffer.  The Central Government must look into that. Please do not go  on the basis of the media trial.  Of course, the provisions are good.  I would seek  one clarification from the hon. Minister. If impositions of penalty are different,  which law would be followed? This Government is finally giving  respect to the Valmiki Community through the Scheduled Caste Order and the Koli  Community and the Pahari Ethnic Group through the Schedule Tribe order. What  is this Government doing with the SCs, STs and OBCs across the Country? Has it  been fulfilling the reservation facilities already in vogue in other parts of the  country? Has there been any specific object to uplift the people of Jammu and  Kashmir by the Government of India? That needs to be clarified. No specific  projects or ideas have been tabled in the House to improve the lives of the people  of Jammu and Kashmir. Only the implementation of the reservation policy will not  serve the purpose. The provision of punishment for atrocities on backward people  has not been highlighted. In 2022 alone, there were nearly 60,000 atrocities against  the Schedule Castes and 10,064 atrocities against the Schedule Tribes. As per the  NCRB data, the crime against tribals has been increasing year after year. Just in 2  years, from 2020 to 2022, there has been nearly 22 per cent increase in crimes  against tribals. Madam, the gross enrolment ratio of SC and ST students at the  undergraduate level is at 23 per cent and 17.2 per cent respectively whereas the  national average is 26.3 per cent. The Eklavya Schools are meant for SC and ST  students. But, still, 38,000 vacancies across the country have not been filled up.  You are setting up schools, Colleges and Universities if the vacancies have not  been filled. Students will come and there will be no teachers to teach me, how will   their education takes place. We have witnessed that the amount allotted for the  Union Government\\u2019s Umbrella Scheme for Development of Scheduled Castes and  the Umbrella Programme for Development of Scheduled Tribes has been  underspent. Sir, these schemes underspent nearly 28 per cent and 24 per cent of the  amount respectively. Please restore the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir to these  people. In the name of demonetization, the people of the country were made to  stand in queues, many lost their lives. Terrorism has not stopped to date. Our  soldiers are sacrificing their lives every day. You are hurting the federal structure.  Ministry spent only 20 per cent less than what they were allotted. We need more  schemes for the welfare of students and also for the welfare of SCs, STs, OBCs  and minorities. We have started the Kanyashree scheme which is benefitting 78  lakh women in West Bengal and which has been recognised by the United Nations.  Mamta Didi's Government has set up a Scheduled Caste Advisory Council which  does not exist in any state. If we truly want to move forward with those thoughts,  then we should take everyone along.  I support these two Amendment Bills  i.e. Constitution (Jammu and Kashmir) Scheduled Castes Order (Amendment) Bill,  2023 and the Constitution (Jammu and Kashmir) Scheduled Tribes Order  (Amendment) Bill, 2023 which are related to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.   The living conditions of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in this country are  very poor. The Government is also not taking care of the welfare of Scheduled  Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the country. The budget allocation under SEP and   TSP for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes has decreased.  In many of the  areas, SC/ST fund allocation has also got lapsed. SC/ST funds in different  Ministries are also not being spent timely.  Atrocities among the Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled Tribes are increasing day by day throughout the country, especially  in the northern part of India. We have the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled  Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act to deal with it, but it is not being  implemented properly. Another important issue is unemployment.  There is a long- pending demand from the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities to  have special recruitment in the Government sector as well as the private sector. I  would appeal to the Ministers to take the necessary steps to conduct a special drive  to fill up the backlog vacancies of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in  their sectors.  The Post-Matric Scholarships are not given timely.  Our SC and ST  students are facing serious problems.  They are solely dependent on scholarships  for their studies but the Government is not taking any serious steps to release the  money for the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe students.  Another long- pending demand is related to the Dalit Christians. They should be included in the  Scheduled Castes List.  I would like to appeal to the Hon. Social Justice and  Empowerment Minister to consider this also. Our country is the biggest democratic and  secular country in the world. However today, our Constitutional rights and freedom  are being denied. If you undertake a critical analysis of the achievements of the  past ten years as stated by the hon. President of India, you will notice that all of  these are a result of the work of previous Governments but the current Union  Government takes credit for everything. The widely publicised Pradhan Mantri  Awas Yojana\\u2013Urban and the AMRUT Scheme was basically a reframing of the  Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission launched much before in 2005.  India is a Socialist Republic, one that should be dedicated to the welfare of the  marginalised without only serving the interests of the one per cent. The Union  Government is also proposing disinvestment in the steel sector PSUs which have  existed almost since the Independence of the country. Starting from 2022 to 2023,  for three consecutive years, the Budget allocated for the agricultural sector has  been decreasing. The word \\u2018Secular\\u2019 also seems to be unfamiliar to the Ruling  Party. While India\\u2019s greatest strength lies in the absence of a singular ethnic or  social identity defining the nation, it appears that the current Government is  leaning towards portraying the country, as a \\u2018Hindu Rashtra\\u2019. This is in stark  contrast to the glorious values of secularism enshrined in our Constitution.  Important issues like economic turmoil, the Manipur Conflict, poor infrastructure  and unemployment are being put on the back burner, rarely featuring in the  discussions of this House. This is the first time in Indian history  that 146 Opposition Members were suspended and the present Government has  passed several important Bills without any discussion. This is a huge threat to our  democracy. The situation in Manipur is still unstable even after eight months of the  incidents. It is astonishing that there is no mention of the Manipur issue in the  President's Address. Madam President did not say anything when women wrestlers  were being manhandled and inhumanly dragged by cops during their peaceful  protest.The country witnessed the rapists and murderers of the Bilkis Bano case  being garlanded after their unjustified release much before the completion of their  imprisonment term. And on other critical issues of national importance, like rising  unemployment and inflation, Madam President continues to remain silent. The  report of the Global Hunger Index of 2023 gives India a rank of 111 out of 125  countries. This indicates an alarming level of hunger severity in the country. The  NCRB report of 2023 shows crimes against Scheduled Castes went up by 13 per  cent and against Scheduled Tribes by 14.3 per cent. Reserved seats meant for  Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are lying vacant in different Government  institutions and departments. Appropriate action is not being taken to fill up these  vacant posts. Child rape cases also witnessed a staggering 90 per cent increase  from 2016 to 2022 as per analysis of NCRB data. It is clear that in reality when it  comes to the actual well-being, socio-economic development and empowerment of  India\\u2019s people, there is really not much that has progressed. In the last decade 16 AIIMS  have been established but none of them is fully functional as per the Press release  of 19th December, 2023 of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. What  remains absent in Madam President\\u2019s Address are issues like unemployment,  which is a burning issue, high inflation, the average commoner compromising with  many essential needs, safety and security of girl child, and MSP for farmers. The  reality of the suffering of ordinary and poor people while travelling by trains across  India has been hidden under the hype of Vande Bharat. As far as the Ujjwala  Yojana is concerned, out of 95.9 million PMUY beneficiaries, 11.8 million did not  get even a single LPG cylinder during the last financial year. The CAG Audit  Report in 2019 revealed the cylinder scam in PMUY.  Thereafter, there were no  reports of CAG on PMUY. I would like to say that the Government is  not  providing a 100 days' fund in West Bengal according to the CAG report. We have  the right to know the name of the States of the country to which you are providing  funds as per the CAG report and also those States to whom you are not providing  it. You talk about enabling the poor to board the aeroplanes, but in economy class,  the minimum domestic flight ticket is available for Rs 30 thousand, Rs 29  thousand. The Government is silent about this also. Women's power is being  discussed everywhere. However, as per the NCRB, in 2013 there were 3,09,546  cases of crimes registered against women. In 2022, it reached to 4,45,256 cases  which shows an increase of 30.48 percent in such crimes.\",\n          \"It is a small Bill, but the gravity of the Bill is  immense as shortcomings exist in the matters related to the court and this Bill  has been brought to rectify them. Without discussing other aspects, I would just  want to say that in the coming days, the judicial process should be very simple,  people should get justice easily and in an affordable manner. This kind of a  system should be in place for all kinds of cases. In the earlier times, the  members of the family and the society used to sit together and find solutions to  such issues, but now a system has evolved that for everything, we have to  approach the court and the cases are not disposed of in time in the court.  Because of this, the people have to face a lot of problems. I would like to make  a small appeal that in all such small issues no one should be punished, if the  people and lawyers of both sides sit together and decide and finally convey their  decision to the court and then we will be able to solve such problemsin large  numbers. Now there is no need for anyone to believe that all the problems will  be solved by enacting a law, and I do not believe at all. I believe that all the  cases should be settled out of the court. It was enunciated by our country  long back about what needs to be done for the people across the world to stem the rot  arising out of the nuclear proliferation. It is alarming to note that still, the world possesses  more than 13,400 nuclear weapons. So, disarmament is the best protection against such  dangers. We have to prepare ourselves for any eventuality. From 1925 to 2017, 10  International Treaties on Weapons of Mass Destruction have been signed. We can't fight  it just by passing laws. Whatever steps are taken to keep our country safe and secure, we  will support them without any hesitation. I rise to support the Weapons of Mass Destruction  and their Delivery Systems (Prohibition of Unlawful Activities) Amendment Bill, 2022.   In Resolution 1540 (2004), the Security Council decided that all States shall refrain from  providing any form of support to actors that attempt to develop, acquire, manufacture,  possess, transport, transfer or use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and their  means of delivery, in particular for terrorist purposes.  The Resolution requires all States  to adopt and enforce appropriate laws to this effect as well as other effective measures to  prevent the proliferation of these weapons and their means of delivery to actors, in  particular for terrorist purposes.  Nonetheless, detecting proliferation-relevant illicit  financing is even harder than detecting money laundering or terrorism financing.  The  risks posed by Weapons of Mass destruction stem not only from ready-made bombs,  nuclear, chemical or radiological material but also from dual-use goods and technology  that are traded, shipped and used globally.  One of the most important areas for the  Government to work upon is on informing the private sector promptly to match changes  in UN designations of entities and individuals.  If the UN Security Council designated  new entities or individuals as proliferators, but a given country failed to update its lists,  what happens is that these financial institutions continue to trade with these entities  because they are not made aware of these changes in time.  So, that is also something that  needs to be considered. I stand here in support of the Bill  that we are discussing today.  India has always had a very good and a positive image of a  peace-loving and peace-making country.  India\\u2019s definition of weapons of mass  destruction is for nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.  So, can we expand it?  I  would like to request that we should consider on broadening the definition of the  Weapons of Mass Destruction.  I would like to talk about some other issues which  nobody else has mentioned the zoonotic diseases.   It is like a pandemic. There is a story  that COVID-19 was attacked which is probably on the globe.  Could we have a broad  discussion on this?  I think that terror-financing is such a thing that must be stopped.  We  support this Bill completely but we must definitely be very careful about the new  technology coming in.  We all are raising our concerns just to make sure that it is a  flawless Bill and make sure that India is known for what it really is. I have a few quick points that I would like to make.    I suggest for consideration of the hon. Minister to attach a schedule to this Bill and list  the Acts, Agreements, and Convention etc which come under the purview of this  legislation.  We have seen umpteen times statements coming from Russia.  If signatories  to the Convention are blatantly breaking it, then, what is the use of this Convention?  We  are going to have the Ninth Review Conference of the Biological Weapons Convention  this year.  I wish to know what would be the approach of India in this Conference, In the  light of ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict,  I wish to know the kind of mechanism and the  national strategy what is in place in the event of a chemical or biological attack.  Several  hon. Members have also asked is about the Corona virus questioning whether it is a  biological attack or not.  I am fully with the hon. Minister and the Government to  ruthlessly crush financing any activity which help in making weapons of mass destruction  and their delivery. As the hon. Minister explained that it is essentially to  make us legally complaint with the mandates of the United Nations Security Council and  the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force.  Could the Minister actually,  throw light as to what steps the Government has taken measures after launch of Brahmos  incident to ensure that something of this sort does not get repeated in future?  In the year  2018, in the Bodh Gaya blast case, the Weapons of Mass Destruction Act was invoked by  the National Investigation Agency.  Could the Minister enlighten us whether chargesheets   were field in terms of these relevant Sections of the WMD Act?  My last point would  relate to our no-first-use posture.  There has a certain amount of ambiguity with regard to  this no-first-use posture.  It would be enlightening to hear from the Minister as to whether  we continue to maintain a no-first-use posture or is there any rethink in Government  which he would like to share with the House? The current conflict in Ukraine is perhaps the most  important  geo-political  event  since  the  pulling  down  of  the  Berlin   Wall in November, 1989.  This war in Ukraine has exposed the limitation of the world  order.  But does it indicate a move towards a new world order?  Everyone is concerned as  to what will happen to the world economy and not just economy of a region or a few  countries, but the ramifications it will have across the world.  We are talking about a  country which is engulfed in a war.  It is not as if the Government did not issue  advisories.  These were exceptional advisories which were issued in the month of January  and registration was opened up.  More than twenty thousand Indians registered  themselves with the Indian Embassy.  But, the situation was so fluid that no one knew for  sure that war is actually going to happen.  All efforts were made to coordinate with  Ukraine and Russia and also other neighbouring countries of Ukraine.  So to expect a  very easy way out, is to expect the moon.  I congratulate the Government for  starting Operation Ganga. The geopolitical tension between Russia and Ukraine has led  to steep increase in prices of global commodities, including prices of crude oil, gas,  edible oils, and fertilizers. As per the feedback received from industry, the exports of  some products like pharmaceuticals, telecom instruments, and coffee and tea from India  are likely to be affected. Evacuation means bringing a person out from the area of crises.  But here, the students had to walk several kilometres and pay exorbitant amount to hire  vehicles to reach the borders. Actually, our Government acted late. The tuition fee in  private medical colleges in India ranges from Rs.60 lakh to Rs.1 crore. This is far beyond  the capacity of middle-class people. Therefore, the students look for relatively less cost- effective institutions in other countries. We are actually unable to provide medical  education at affordable rate inside the country. It is important to see that the career of  these young students does not suffer. In the conflict that is going on between Russia and  Ukraine, thousands of people have been killed and lakhs have been displaced. Weapons  manufacturers are working to earn a lot of profit by selling weapons. Japan and Germany  have spoken of rearming themselves. Europe is rearming itself. Today again a war is  going on between us, which we are witnessing in Ukraine. The entire international  community has completely failed to stop this centuries-long conflict which has turned  into a war. Today, the policy of India is that this war should be stopped by getting this  whole issue peacefully and diplomatically resolved. India has to show great skill to deal  with this matter. We believed in a completely fair foreign policy and we are still  following it. Inflation is increasing in our markets. Be it the price of metals and  petroleum or the price of food items or the price of fertilizers, there is an increase in the  price of everything. Thank you, Chairman Sir. I congratulate and thank  for the historic work done by Hon'ble Minister of External Affairs Jaishankar ji,  Honorable Minister Scindia ji, Honorable Minister Rijiju ji, Honorable Minister Hardeep  Singh Puri ji and V. K. Singh sahib ji Under the leadership of Prime Minister. As I heard  the debate, it seemed that India's foreign policy was made only after 1947 and Nehru ji  founded it. Earlier there was no foreign policy at all. When 5000 people of Poland were  looking for shelter everywhere during the Second World War, then the Raja of Jamnagar  gave shelter to those 5000 people of Poland in Gujarat. It is because of the same Gujarati  connection that the Polish government supported our students, our people. So foreign  policy didn\\u201ft start with Nehru ji. When Bharatiya Janata Party formed the government in  the year 2014-15, it said that now our foreign policy will run on the basis of  Panchamrita. Panchamrita means we will live with dignity. Today foreign policy will be  governed by dialogue. Honorable Prime Minister has such power, this country has such  power that it can save itself in this war and can also stop the war. We have signed an FTA  with Australia for the first time. Foreign policy should be discussed in this country, who  made China our neighbor? You say that we always abuse Nehru, we abuse Congress.  The situation in Ukraine is not self-made like we are  seeing in Sri Lanka today.  Vladimir Putin\\u201fs dream is becoming Ukraine\\u201fs nightmare.  The threat of chemical war is also a major concern. Russia unfolded its hybrid war  against Ukraine. The stand taken by India, be it at the UN Security Council or at QUAD  Foreign Ministers\\u201f meeting at Melbourne is welcome. This is the stand of India, that  cooperation and collaboration will help douse the conflict between Russia and Ukraine  and ensure long-term peace and stability in the region. With pressure mounting from the  West led by the US, we have to make a very difficult strategic choice between principles  and values on one side and pragmatism and interest on the other. The time has come  where we need to move closer to the US and the QUAD Summit in May this year is one  such opportunity for India. we have been adopting a non-aligned approach. We have  taken sides or worked closely with world powers only when national interest is involved.   in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, I do not see any national interest involved. I  have a few economic bullet points. More than 500 million dollars\\u201f worth of exporters  payments are stuck in Russia due to sanctions. Ukraine is the third largest producer and  exporter of maize and Ukraine and Russia are also top two exporters of sunflower oil  which we import. Russia is also the world\\u201fs second largest exporter of muriate of potash  fertilizer which we import. Out of 5.09 metric tonnes that we import, one-third come  from Belarus and Russia. Ukraine is the third largest supplier of urea to India. We are  also importing crude oil from Russia, Exports from India like medicines, tea, etc. to  Russia are impacted due to shipment concerns and there is also shortage of containers. A  carefully calibrated stand by New Delhi has created a distinctive space for diplomacy by  not only maintaining equi-distance between the two powers but also moving towards a  multipolar world. Sir, it sounds like music that the  statesmanship of Pandit Nehruji has been remembered again given the contemporary  political and diplomatic situation prevailing across the world. Shri Kiren Rijiju rightly  said that whoever in the government, they should have fulfilled this responsibility, we are  fulfilling the responsibility. That is our tradition. Still why do we debate? If there is any  mistake, alerting the government, advising the government, this is the duty of the  opposition, which we do. First, I would say that Could we explore any idea that Indian  Parliament could pass a unanimous resolution to suggest both the warring countries of  Russia and Ukraine that they may restrain from their present situation? Jaishankar ji is a  tall and capable foreign minister. I want to ask him a couple of questions, First, does the  Ukraine-Russia conflict really test India's Foreign Policy resilience?, What are the  complications outlining India's restraint?  I support the Constitution (Scheduled  Castes and Scheduled Tribes) Orders (Amendment) Bill, 2022 which seeks to omit the  Entry of Bhogta community from the list of Scheduled Castes and also, it seeks to bring  in certain communities in the list of Scheduled Tribes. We must remember Dr. B.R.  Ambedkar\\u201fs remarks that a free society in India is a far distant possibility till the ill- treatment and suppression of one class by the other is there. Equality could also be a  fiction nonetheless one should settle for it as a governing precept. We have to have  equality in the society. Celebration of birthday of Birsa Munda, setting up of Eklavya  Model Residential Schools and announcing scholarship by Prime Minister Modi\\u201fs  Government to the 30 lacs students of these schools shows its commitment towards  tribals. Antodaya, Jal Jeevan Mission and Swachh Bharat Scheme are some of efforts  being made for upliftment of tribals and downtrodden. With the passing of the Constitution (Scheduled  Castes and Scheduled Tribes) Orders (Amendment) Bill, 2022, these communities will  definitely have economic and educational development and they will get the benefit of  development. SC/STs are still at a backstage in the flow of development, it is necessary  to bring them into the mainstream. A distinguished member in the Constituent Assembly  had said that the credit for India's independence will be given to Mahatma Gandhiji and  the credit to codify India's independent regime will be given to Dr. Ambedkar, the great  architect of our great Constitution. There is much more to be done by the society in our  country. Many people from the disadvantaged sections do not know about their rights and  the various programmes being run by the Government in their interests. These  communities should be informed and made aware about welfare schemes. The extension of train no. 12505/06 North-East  Express, Kamakhya- Annand Vihar Terminal, can connect passengers of Jhunjhunu,  Sikar and Jaipur.  Since initial maintenance of train no. 12505/6 is undertaken at  Kamkhaya and it keeps stationed for about ten hours at Annand Vihar Terminal.  By  increasing one rake of this train, this train can ply from Jhunjhunu to Jaipur via Sikar.    What justice stands to mean is that the criminals  should be taken to task and justice be delivered to the victims. This sensitivity is called  for in the judicial system. If we want to build the best country, we will have to enact good  laws. It is said that our eco-system is not in order and then the question arise as to how to  fix it. That\\u201fs why I am making my points on this issue. The conviction rate is merely  14.35 per cent which entails that about 85 per cent of the criminals get scot-free.  Therefore, the faith of the common people in the judicial system is getting undermined.  People say that the police personnel do not conduct scientific investigation. This Bill has  been brought in to make that very scientific investigation possible. The 87th report of the  Law Commission of India reveals that the criminal justice system of the country is very  colonial and heavily tilted in favour of criminal. Hence, good and stern laws are required  to be enacted and enforced properly as well. It is being said repeatedly that the law will  be misused. Let me know which law is not misused. We have so much political will  power that we will not allow it to be misused. I would like to support this Bill  and say that it is very important for the people of the country to understand that even their  single vote is very important for the development of the country. Everyone must vote and  all the facilities to those people should be stopped who do not vote. Compulsory voting is  very important so that we can all actively participate in the democratic process. Voting  I.D. of every voter should be compulsorily linked with his or her Aadhaar so that no one  dares to cast any bogus vote. The Army and paramilitary forces should be exempted from  compulsory voting as they are stationed at different places for the security of the country.  Compulsory voting will also be useful for crime identification as well as for education,  health and economy of the country. Earlier, the voting percentage in Jammu and Kashmir  was very low, but since the abrogation of Article 370, the voting percentage there has  gone up and the democracy is getting stronger. Many youths from Ladakh and other parts  of the country study in different corners of the country. We also need to consider how to  provide voting facilities to these youth. The sport is one topic which  unifies every nation whether we are playing cricket or football or other sports. The beauty  of sports is that it is about discipline, teamwork and a lot of hard work that goes behind.  The contribution of Khelo India Programme is really great. It is a very encouraging step  for the new generation.We should just rise above politics in sports. The infrastructure of  sports has improved. There is some more way for our States to improve our  infrastructure, it is good. Indian cricket is discussed almost like you discuss politics on  every dining table. The IPL is a great success story that India has seen, and a lot of new  talent has come with it. It is the same thing with Kabaddi and Pro-Kabaddi. They even  get financial support because there are sponsors in this game. Today, the BCCI is  autonomous and football league is autonomous, and they are doing a good job. So, the  Government does not necessarily have to interfere but if you can complement each other,  it is overall good for the sports sector. There are two sports, outside of Khelo India, that  we need to promote. One is traditional sports and the other is adventure sports. Adventure  sports is a very big business in tourism. With the unemployment challenges and with the  global crisis, tourism is a very big option and so adventure tourism and traditional  tourism can open up a lot of doors for youngsters who can make their hobby into careers.  Sports unifies society at large and the country at large. Games in India has witnessed various  stages of change from ancient to modern times. There is no dearth of talents in our  country but we cannot win medals in the world competition just by having talents. For  that, we need technology in sports, better training, good exercise, right eating habits and  positive environment. The Government has decided to continue Khelo India scheme for  development of sports during the period of 15th Finance Commission (2021-22 to 2025- 26) with an outlay of Rs. 3165.50 crore. From the year 2017 to 2021, three editions of  Khelo India School and Youth Games, one edition of Khelo India University Games and  two editions of Khelo India Winter Games have been organized. More than 20,000  sportspersons participated in these games out of which about 3,000 sportspersons have  been identified as Khelo India Athletes (KIA) who are getting training in new form of  SAI centres i.e. Khelo India Academies at present. The Government has sanctioned 282  sports infrastructure projects of various types of worth Rs. 2,328 crore during the last five  years. Sports stadiums may be constructed in Shri Karanpur, Shri Vijaynagar,  Sadulshahar and Suratgarh under my Parliamentary Constituency, Shri Ganganagar and Pilibanga and Sangaria under Hanumangarh district under Khelo India scheme. An  archery academy may be set up in Rajasthan. There are several countries where the  dual model of accounting institutes exists. Confusion has been created by the existence of  two titles and both CMAs and CAs co-exist in harmony rendering service to the society.  The 45th Report of Standing Committee clearly recommended for change in nomenclature  of Cost and Works Accountants to Cost and Management Accountants. It is observed that  the Ministry is ignoring the demand of Cost Accountants for more than three decades I  urge the Finance Minister to consider my humble request. Clauses 21, 56 and 89 in the  Bill prevent a complainant from withdrawing the complaint. In any of the Bills, such  prohibition of withdrawals is not found. It is a fundamental right of any individual to  withdraw the case filed by him/her.  I would request the hon. Finance Minister to kindly  consider dropping of clause 32,67 and 100 from the said Bill. We have seen failure of  insolvency and Bankruptcy Law for following timelines given by the courts. Hence, it is  proposed to remove the timelines given in these clauses. Some provisions lack natural  justice to the complainant and respondent by not providing them any opportunity to file a  rejoinder. I rise to oppose the Bill. In this Bill,  changes have been proposed to existing legislations governing the apex Institutes of  Chartered Accountants, Cost Accountants and Company Secretaries. The unprecedented  provisions of appointing two non-CAs as members out of three members in the Board  may have a larger impact as the work of CAs would be majorly judged by non-CAs.  The  Institute of Chartered Accountants of India has raised concerns over the proposal to have  non-Chartered Accountant as the Presiding Officer of its Disciplinary Committee. At  present, the President or the Vice President of ICAI acts as the Presiding Officer, and it is  the practice that the Institute wants to continue. I would like to say that we should trust  our CAs. They have been working for us the last 75 years with much dedication. They are  also the nation builders. So, Let us give them more autonomy rather than taking away the  autonomy and saying that we are providing autonomy.  I would like to speak on the Chartered Accountants,  the Cost and Works Accountants and the Company Secretaries (Amendment) Bill, 2021.  Indian Institute of Chartered Accountants is the only institute in the country. The  Standing Committee itself has given a report in which they have categorically mentioned  that appointing a Chairman or a President for the disciplinary committee from the  bureaucracy is objectionable. The institute has served the country for many years. Even  in finalising the taxation also, they have come forward and helped the Government. As  far as NCLT is concerned, I would like to know from the hon. Minister  that after the  formation of the NCLT, what are the decisions given by the NCLT.  The company which  is having a capital of around thousands of crore of rupees is being sold for a few crores of  rupees. I request the hon. Minister, through you, to please send this Bill to a Select  Committee. Let us discuss it elaborately and let us come up with a very good Bill which  will protect the investors and which will serve the Institute also.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":42}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n","from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\n","\n","# Example function to generate N-grams from text\n","def generate_ngrams(text, n=2):\n","    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)\n","    ngrams = []\n","    for i in range(len(tokens) - n + 1):\n","        ngrams.append(' '.join(tokens[i:i+n]))\n","    return ngrams\n","\n","# Example function to compute Cosine similarity between speeches\n","def compute_similarity(speeches):\n","    # Initialize CountVectorizer to convert speeches into a matrix of token counts\n","    vectorizer = CountVectorizer(analyzer=generate_ngrams)\n","    speech_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(speeches)\n","\n","    # Compute cosine similarity between speeches\n","    similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(speech_matrix)\n","    return similarity_matrix\n","\n","# Example usage:\n","# Assuming combined_speeches contains speeches combined based on both year and category\n","\n","# Extract speeches for a specific category and year\n","category = 'Issue'\n","year = 2024\n","speeches_for_category_and_year = combined_speeches_new[(combined_speeches_new['Category'] == category) & (combined_speeches_new['Year'] == year)]['Speech']\n","\n","# Compute similarity matrix for speeches in the given category and year\n","similarity_matrix = compute_similarity(speeches_for_category_and_year)\n","\n","# Print similarity matrix\n","print(\"Cosine Similarity Matrix:\")\n","print(similarity_matrix)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"MPu7rA0fZT93","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710796310902,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":361,"user":{"displayName":"045_Punerva Singh","userId":"02056743895864260867"}},"outputId":"625cd814-1f98-421c-ff81-73988741353c"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Cosine Similarity Matrix:\n","[[1.]]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"YbDCeGdggYl_"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
